| 0:22:03| Any other business for beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| I would like to remind the beer board that I made the request of the law director to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1326)|
| 0:22:14| for next month to bring us a document, at least in draft form, outlining possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1334)|
| 0:22:23| criminal consequences, fines, associated actions that could occur in a form, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1343)|
| 0:22:32| document that we might require in the beer permitting process of a vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1352)|
| 0:22:40| So, we'll have that in some form next month and we'll discuss that and see what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| beer board thinks about it as another way possibly to help in this process of avoiding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1366)|
| 0:22:55| underage consumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| So, that's the intent anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| Any other items to discuss or any comments about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| We're adjourned until 145 honorariums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1386)|

| 0:24:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| So, for public forum, we've got quite a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| I'd just like to remind the folks that are going to speak at public forum, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| Come to the podium there in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1473)|

| 0:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| The first person that I have on public forum is Tom Driscoll, Sr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1482)|
| 0:24:52| Tom Driscoll, Sr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| And we'll come back to some of these people if they're in time again, if they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| Lance McCold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| Lance McCold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| Diane Jablonski.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| Thank you, Ms. Jablonski.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| I'm sorry, Diane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| Are we going to give an option to speak to public forum now when their issue comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1522)|
| 0:25:28| or are we going to go through them all now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| I just want to get some understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| Well, I'm just going by our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| If we could make that option available, I suppose, if these folks wanted to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| and speak at that item at that time, that's at the discretion of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1541)|
| 0:25:49| The question is, can they do both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| I would think, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| I just know normally, I know sometimes we would give, and I'm looking to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| that we would give an option if you all wanted to speak on it when the issue is before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| as opposed to at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| No, I don't think they should speak at both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| Is there any objection to people speaking at the time the item comes up on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1573)|
| 0:26:20| Neither or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| I think that's what you're talking about for individuals, but a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| One individual could speak now and then not speak at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| but other individuals could speak to the topic when it comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| I think that's what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| Yes, that's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| Then we'll make that option available to you, Ms. Jablonski, if you'd like to speak now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| or if you want to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| I think it's item 903 that you're interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| I don't mind leading you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| You go right ahead, Ms. Jablonski.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| My name is Diane Jablonski.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| I live at 11640 South Monticello Drive in Farragut, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1613)|
| 0:27:00| Good afternoon, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| I want to address the subjects of appointed superintendents and partisan elections of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1621)|
| 0:27:08| I have experienced both in the time that I served on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| My first election I ran as a declared Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| I've been a Republican for as long as I can remember, dragging a wagon around my neighborhood with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| I like Ike signs on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| The second time I ran, the race was nonpartisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| Again, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| But what I noticed was that there were people who were not affiliated with any party whatsoever who were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1651)|
| 0:27:38| deciding to run for school board, the reason being that they were interested in education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| and it wasn't a political issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| But the other thing that I had noticed was that no longer were there people that were no more Republican| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| than Bill Clinton who were running on the Republican primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| In my opinion, the basis for running a school board election as a partisan election is absolutely bogus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1679)|
| 0:28:07| because anybody knows what a person's party affiliation is if they're active in politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| And if they're not active in politics and they're going to run in a partisan race, they'd better run for the party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1694)|
| 0:28:21| that's dominant in their district or they won't get elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| So it's a bogus issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| But why is it important for them to be of a party in the school board race anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| Personally, I don't see where it helps the situation at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| I didn't think that I would like it, but it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| It helps the school board work more cooperatively with each other without having party politics involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1723)|
| 0:28:54| Now to appointed superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| Why are you doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| I will admit I'm angry with you for putting this forth because it's nothing more than a power grab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| Appointed is better plain and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| The superintendent who is appointed goes through a vetting process, a very public vetting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1745)|
| 0:29:14| where their record is put on display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| They, after being selected, have to put together an agenda, a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| a process that's going to be approved by the elected school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| And they have to move it forward or else they can be let go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| Under an elected superintendent, however, the superintendent must fundraise and campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1775)|
| 0:29:42| And as in the past, school board members have been tagged on to run the campaigns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1782)|
| 0:29:50| for the elected superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| Many times their efforts are rewarded by promotions and principalships, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1793)|
| 0:30:01| Nepotism still runs rampant in the school system today thanks to the past elected superintendent process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1801)|
| 0:30:11| For commission, I take to take on this issue, in my opinion, is tantamount to the news media making an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1811)|
| 0:30:19| out of Marco Rubio taking a drink of water while ignoring Benghazi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| We have enough on our plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| You need to get your own house in order than trying to thwart the efforts of the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| in an obvious power grab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| Over the past decade, our elected officials have been involved in one scandal after another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| Some of these are still ongoing and yet have to be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| Sadly, from my perspective, those particular office holders were nine times out of ten Republicans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1845)|
| 0:30:53| I am a die-in-the-wool Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| I'm also a Christian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| I'm married.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| And I've lived in this community for 27 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| We need to move this community forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| You should be focusing your energy on improving the quality of life here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| And you should be actively making Knox County a more desirable community to live in and to work in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1870)|
| 0:31:17| and to bring jobs to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| The best school system is going to help you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| So you need to help the school board be the best school system it can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| and stop being involved in politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| This maneuver on your part is like Congress spending countless hours on this steroid issue with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1892)|
| 0:31:39| professional athletes while our economy was in the toilet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| You need to concentrate on doing your job before you try to interfere with a system that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1903)|
| 0:31:49| Please, please do not vote for an elected superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1909)|
| 0:31:55| and do not make the school board races partisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Thank you, Ms. Umbachinsky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| Jennifer Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1927)|
| 0:32:18| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| Jennifer Evans, 17 Market Square, Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| I believe you are here to speak about the elected superintendent's issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| I believe you know many of the arguments that several of us are here against elected superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| Less accountability narrows the pool of qualified applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| There will be constant campaigning on the part of the candidates for superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| And I hope you also know that less than 1% of the districts in this country are still elected superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, in fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| Mississippi actually has a bill in their General Assembly to get rid of electeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| We would be gone behind Mississippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| I thought it was interesting today attending your chairman's luncheon where you had your ethics training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| And the gentleman said that contributions require something at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| And that really stuck with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| You know, if we have an elected superintendent, just keep in mind that they will be campaigning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| and taking in contributions and they might feel obligated to owe something at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| Elected superintendents will set us back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| And I will be the first to admit that the school system is not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| But electing superintendents will not cure any of the ills that you think may exist at the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| It will create more and it will set us back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| Finally, I keep hearing that East Tennessee constituents want to vote for their superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| And I'm a constituent and I don't want to vote for my superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| And everyone I know wants to keep appointing their superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| And I represent the chamber with thousands of businesses that feel the same that I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| So I'm here to say that your constituents don't want to elect superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Thank you, Ms. Sovins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| I'd just like to remind the audience, those that have signed up to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| that you all have the right to wait until an item is on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| I see a couple of other items that you may not realize that are on the agenda today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2056)|
| 0:34:22| but if you want to talk about school security, it will most likely be on the agenda again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| So if you want to wait until any of your particular items come up on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| you're welcome to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| The next person that's listed is Virginia Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| Virginia Babb, 5332 Riverbriar Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2077)|
| 0:34:53| And I probably would rather wait until the resolution comes up that you're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| but I am here because I'm a parent and I have carpool to pick up at 4 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| so I don't know when you're going to get to it, so I'll go ahead and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| I am here because I strongly believe in keeping an appointed superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| These are bills that are going to go before our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| I feel like they are fully capable of voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| I think for your body to pass a resolution at this point saying you represent what Knox Countians believe in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2118)|
| 0:35:27| I don't think is truly representing what everybody in Knox County really believes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| I personally am for appointed superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| What I have found is over the last couple of weeks, I didn't think that this was going to have to become my job lately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2136)|
| 0:35:42| to have to talk to everyone I know about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| People were kind of shocked to even find out that y'all were talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| The people that I have talked to, which has been a lot of them, I've talked to some principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| I've talked to teachers, I've talked to parents, I've talked to business people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| really kind of shocked that this is even being considered on the state level at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| but then that you're not really representing them if you right now pass a resolution to go to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2161)|
| 0:36:08| Obviously if the state passes this, there's a whole different issue that will come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| And at that point, the Knox County citizens can get educated about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| And I think when people really know what it means between elected and appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| there are going to be people on both sides, I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| But what I'm finding is people really don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| And I'll just kind of give you a little example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| I know that GOP had a breakfast that was widely publicized in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| where everyone resoundingly got up and was for elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| The next day was the Super Bowl, and I was at a party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| And a friend of mine came up to me, and I was kind of talking to her about why I was for appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| And she goes, you know, that side of it never came up at that breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| And I think that's what I want to point out, is I think our constituency really needs to hear both sides of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| so people, if they do go vote, know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| And I think that's why I do not think the Knox County Commission should vote on this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| John Bostet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| Go ahead, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| May I ask a question, because I'm not clear on this either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| and I hope it really helps some of the people out there understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| How did this come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| I think it's Commissioner Wright's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| But from what I read in the paper, anyway, is that we were asked, or at least some of the state representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| either a state senator or a state representative, had asked us to vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| to get input before they pushed it forward, or how did this come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| Because I think that's a question that some other people have that I don't know the answer to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| I mean, this didn't come out of the blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| I know some of this is originating in the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| Okay, Mr. Wright, would you like to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| I'm prepared to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| I was going to, at the making of the motion, give what I thought to be the story, as I'm hearing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| from the people who I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| But speaking of the state, the bill is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| And they're asking, what is the flavor of your districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| And I believe that I'm not sure of the count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| It doesn't make any difference, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| There are seven or eight counties that have already had their legislative body meetings for the month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| and have voiced a resolution that the state legislature take up this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2311)|
| 0:38:39| And I believe that's what we're about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| This is not about qualifications or the process or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| This is just about whether or not this should be killed right now outright at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2327)|
| 0:38:55| And I'm here to say, I'll say it again in a few minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| the people that I represent have brought this continuing theme up every year that I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| And I've talked to Frank Nicely and other people about it in years gone by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| And this year they're doing it a little bit different in the way they've introduced bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| They've restricted the number of bills that they have before them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| And this one is still one that's bubbling up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| And it's not up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| It's not up to the electorate in Knox County at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2361)|
| 0:39:29| It's should the discussion take place is all this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| And you said there's some bills that are already in front of the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| I didn't see any of those attached to our agenda when we discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| What does the bill actually say would happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| Well, the bill's not going to really say what's going to happen because they haven't passed one yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| Or what's proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| I mean, if this passes, does it then come back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| Or is it statewide in all the school districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| Or what is the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| It'd just be another option in my opinion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| See, we're just now we're beginning to speculate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| In my opinion, it would then be up to Knox County to take a direction on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| As it is right now, there is no election of the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| This is not about our current or former superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| This is strictly an issue of whether or not we would like to see them discuss same in the state legislature this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2422)|
| 0:40:32| It's actually done in past years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| So there actually is no bill in front of the legislature right now that says anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| It's just whether they want to even bring up the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| So we don't know if it comes back to us with a 50-50 vote or a two-thirds vote or whether it would be a referendum item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2442)|
| 0:40:49| We don't know what it's going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| To be continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| I just wanted to add, I think there is a bill, but it's in committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| It hasn't made it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| There's been a bill several years now, but it's never made it out of committee to the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| But there is a bill there, but that's the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| Does it get to the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| Do you know what that bill says?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| I mean, does it say that it comes back to each individual school district, you know, government in the school district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| and then does it take a 50 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| I think it comes back to the county commission and requires a two-thirds vote of the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| then to go to the electorate for a referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| So it ultimately would be a referendum item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| I think I'll wait until we ---- I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| I was going to talk now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| I think I'll wait until we bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| There's going to be ample opportunity, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| Mr. Bostad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| My name is John Bostad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| I live at 7317 Westridge Drive in Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2505)|
| 0:41:52| I've lived in Knox County for 34 happy years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| Thanks very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| I want to begin by clarifying this discussion that just took five minutes confused me completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2518)|
| 0:42:06| I'm reading off your agenda the relevant point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| Consideration of a resolution of the county commission expressing support of this bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2530)|
| 0:42:18| SB916HB741, expressing support of that bill providing for electing school superintendents in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2538)|
| 0:42:28| So this is a ---- I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| And what I came here to speak about is you are going to vote on whether you support the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2551)|
| 0:42:37| That's what's on the agenda, whether you support the bill for electing school superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2557)|
| 0:42:43| Am I wrong on that or is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| I just wanted to ---- because I was very confused over the discussion that just took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| That wasn't what I anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| Ladies and gentlemen, how many times have you heard someone say around here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| if it ain't broke, don't fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| That was never more true than on this issue of electing school superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| If it ain't broke, don't fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| Electing superintendents would turn the clock back 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2594)|
| 0:43:21| As we try so hard to attract upscale jobs to locate in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2601)|
| 0:43:28| I don't think that's the message we want to be sending out to leading entrepreneurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2608)|
| 0:43:36| 99% of the school districts in the country, in 99%, their voters and their elected leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2616)|
| 0:43:47| have decided on appointed superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| Surely this is one area where we can't afford to be seen as the oddball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2631)|
| 0:43:59| Nationally, statewide, and locally, we are engaged in huge campaigns to improve our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2639)|
| 0:44:06| None of those campaigns involves electing superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| That key organization founded by our senator, Bill Frist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2651)|
| 0:44:18| the State Collaborative on Reforming Education, or SCORE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| chaired by our own former state senator, Jamie Woodson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| former chair of the Senate Education Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| has issued a comprehensive analysis on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| I know you've all read that. It's on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| It is four square against electing superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2680)|
| 0:44:47| That is the leading educational reform institution in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| led by Bill Frist and Jamie Woodson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| We don't need to put patronage politics in our children's classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| We don't need the school system to become one big patronage mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2700)|
| 0:45:10| We don't need school superintendents to be worrying about political donations and favors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| We need the best professionals we can get across the country to run our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2716)|
| 0:45:22| People who have been practicing in schools for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| and keeping up with the waves of research about what works and what doesn't work in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2726)|
| 0:45:35| And they, those appointed superintendents, are in turn held directly accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2735)|
| 0:45:42| on a monthly and perhaps on a daily basis, for all I know, by our elected school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2742)|
| 0:45:49| And those are community leaders who are committed to following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| school issues and school research over a period of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2754)|
| 0:46:02| So in short, electing superintendents makes about as much sense as electing our dentist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2762)|
| 0:46:13| I urge you to vote against this resolution to elect school superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| Let's get on with the critical work of improving our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| on which hangs the future of our children and our community. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2783)|
| 0:46:34| Thank you, Mr. Bousquet. John Kennerly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2794)|
| 0:46:41| John Kennerly. I reside in Knox County at 1711 Vander Ridge Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2801)|
| 0:46:50| This topic today is a follow-up on a presentation I made one year ago to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2810)|
| 0:46:56| And it basically says that rural metro has violated my Fourth Amendment civil rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2816)|
| 0:47:03| in a 9-11 response to my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2823)|
| 0:47:10| My Fourth Amendment states, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| the right of the people to be secure in their persons, house, papers, and effects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| against unreasonable searches and seizures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| And it shall not be violated and provides that warrants shall be issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| and must be specific as to the place, persons, and things to be seized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2847)|
| 0:47:34| This is appealed by rural metro's blatant violation of my Fourth Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2854)|
| 0:47:42| Rural metro came into my house on June 11, 2011, answering a 9-11 call where I had fallen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2862)|
| 0:47:51| I was placed in their ambulance under the hot sun for 20 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| while the two EMTs and the two firefighters ransacked my house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| searching for and seizing two of my guns and all the ammunition that they could find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2883)|
| 0:48:09| At the time, I had a probable concussion and was bleeding out there in that sun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| Three friends were present, fortunately, and witnessed to the rural metro actions in my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2896)|
| 0:48:23| They were told by rural metro that I was a dangerous man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| Do I look dangerous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| And that I would probably kill myself or them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| And if that isn't slander, I don't know what is, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| And I ask you, where does rural metro qualify as psychiatrists and medical doctors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2919)|
| 0:48:47| Rural metro are also not agents of law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| They have no authority in Knox County or any other place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| They have no authority under the law to conduct searches and seizures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| Such actions must be done by officers of Knox County Sheriff's Department under a valid warrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2940)|
| 0:49:07| Knox County Sheriff's Office wasn't asked to be present during that raid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| Two pieces of very valuable property to me, a loaded semi-automatic pistol and a diamond ring my wife gave me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2952)|
| 0:49:21| were missing when I returned from the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| A very important fact in this matter is that rural metro ordered my witnesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| out of the area where the items were missing late in the visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| They told them that they needed to complete their search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| Well, they sure did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| My witnesses have given depositions that they say rural metro persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| rifling through my personal property in my bedroom closet where the missing items were in plain view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2985)|
| 0:49:52| The pistol was on one side and the ring was on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| And they were right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| Of course, none of the witnesses saw the items converted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| But they did witness rural metro insisting that my neighbor, who was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| take the seized guns and the ammo to her house for safekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3006)|
| 0:50:12| She did so with great reluctance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| The last sentence, the rural metro 9-11 report states that there were loaded guns in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3014)|
| 0:50:21| I will swear under oath to you or anybody else that the only loaded gun in my house was the one which disappeared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3021)|
| 0:50:29| They can deny their covert actions with impunity because there's no accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3029)|
| 0:50:36| The rural metro appears to me, from this painful experience, to be a rogue organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| Totally out of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| By their management's own admission to my attorney, in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| there are no guidelines, procedures, or agreements in place to govern their actions in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3052)|
| 0:50:58| And I hope you don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| In summary, I strongly appeal to this commission to conduct an investigation in the way rural metro operates in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3061)|
| 0:51:09| and into their actions in my home specifically, and make the findings available openly to my fellow citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3069)|
| 0:51:16| and I speak for the citizens of Knox County and Knoxville, who are likely to be victimized as I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3076)|
| 0:51:23| This is a scandalous situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| The commission, I implore you to understand, are responsible to the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| for the performance of their contractors, and rural metro is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| This is an especially timely issue since the commission recently renewed rural metro's contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3098)|

| 0:51:57| Jim DeRaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| Would you like to wait, Mr. DeRaw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3120)|
| 0:52:06| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| And I need you and my colleagues to remind me of that fact when the time comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| Ms. McKenzie, Sherry McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3137)|
| 0:52:23| Thank you, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| I'm Sherry McKenzie, and I live at 7729 Charmwood Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| I came to last week's workshop, and the issue that I'm concerned about had been moved to the beginning, so I missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3149)|
| 0:52:36| But I'm here to speak to you about the school security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| On February 2nd, school security became an issue brought to light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3162)|
| 0:52:53| and two of our school board members, Ms. Carson and Dr. McIntyre, I guess he's not really school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3173)|
| 0:53:06| but they issued statements in a news release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3186)|
| 0:53:13| Dr. McIntyre said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| The school board has charged me with the safety of our children and security of our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| and it's a responsibility I take extremely seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| I can assure you that I work hard every single day to make sure that our children are safe in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3201)|
| 0:53:27| Ms. Carson says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| I want to be really clear that the safety and security of our students and our staff is number one priority every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3209)|
| 0:53:36| We go to extraordinary lengths to ensure we provide a safe learning environment for our students and our educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3216)|
| 0:53:44| I decided that I would take the opportunity to use the school board meeting as an open forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3224)|
| 0:53:51| to express concerns that I've had for the past four years since my granddaughter started elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3231)|
| 0:53:58| And the particular school that she goes to is Corriechin Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| I have spoken to Commissioner Norman and Commissioner Wright, whose district Corriechin is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| I'm here not just representing Corriechin, but for the many schools that are out there like Corriechin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3249)|
| 0:54:16| who are smaller schools, who do not have the same surveillance and security systems and full-time police officers at the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3256)|
| 0:54:29| When the school board talked about this issue, at the end of their discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3269)|
| 0:54:36| it was suggested that they do a random survey to see what each school had in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3276)|
| 0:54:46| And Commissioner Seposi had said in a news statement to the New Sentinel, speaking as a parent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3286)|
| 0:54:58| parents thought that they were getting state-of-the-art equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| We paid really good money to protect our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| My neighbors want the best for our kids and want them protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| We want what we paid for and what the taxpayers paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| Well, so do every other parent out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| We're all taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| If you reside, you pay taxes in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| We all want the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| It doesn't matter if it's a West Knoxville school, east, south, or north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3323)|
| 0:55:29| Every child has the same right to be protected and to go to school and feel safe and secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3329)|
| 0:55:37| We place our children in the custody, so to speak, of the teachers and the staff that are there to take care of our children in our place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3337)|
| 0:55:48| These educators should not have to worry, first and foremost, about security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3348)|
| 0:55:55| When I spoke up about Coreyton, it's a small little school in the northeast Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3355)|
| 0:56:03| and I said that they didn't have a security system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| Well, I should have said they didn't have an adequate security system because I think that kind of got picked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3365)|
| 0:56:12| But when you go to that school, the front door is locked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| You have to ring a bell to get inside the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| The two back doors that concern me the most, each one of them is at a restroom, and they're not locked during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3380)|
| 0:56:30| They don't have a surveillance system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| They share a security officer with Gibbs Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| They have six classrooms that are out in portable buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| There is no security other than locking the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| and the principal doesn't have a surveillance system outside either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| so she can't monitor what's going on with half of her school because third through fifth graders are outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3408)|
| 0:56:57| How can we say that the school systems are safe when we're not comparing apples to apples?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3417)|
| 0:57:04| They all don't have the same benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| In a blanket email, Dr. McIntyre said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| I have shared with parents on many occasions that the security and safety of students are first and greatest priority in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3433)|
| 0:57:20| I can assure you that our school's electronic security systems, including security alarms, fire protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| video monitoring systems are operating appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| Well, this is a misleading statement because they are not all operating because they don't all have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3449)|
| 0:57:37| And I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| I challenged the school board that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| I challenged Commissioner McMillan because it's in his school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| You are responsible to the children and the parents in this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| I challenge and charge you to make sure that this school has adequate security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3470)|
| 0:57:59| After their discussion, I believe it was either Commissioner Deakins or McMillan asked Ms. Carson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3479)|
| 0:58:07| at which time do you think that we will be doing this random survey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| And she said, well, I'm not really sure, but I don't see the urgency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3492)|
| 0:58:18| Well, this is the same commissioner that said that school security was her number one priority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3498)|
| 0:58:25| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| That's not how you handle something that is your number one priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| When I spoke, I said that random is not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| Dr. McIntyre came up to me after I spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| and he told me that Coryton had a security system that was alarmed after school at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3522)|
| 0:58:54| Ms. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| I'm sorry to interrupt you, but you have exceeded your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| And I assure you this discussion is continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3541)|
| 0:59:08| But I think it best that we adhere to the five-minute rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| Could you make a last statement, if you would like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| Well, I want to make sure that none of the schools fall through the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3556)|
| 0:59:23| And I want to make sure that there are two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| There's one concerning the failure that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| The companies that got told responsible and find out what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| And also that there is a breakdown in communication with the school board and the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3575)|
| 0:59:43| But most importantly, it's the security and the safety of all of the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| And I would hope that commission would take this into consideration and use their resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3589)|
| 1:00:00| Mayor Burchett has given additional funding last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| and he has said that he would be willing to give more funding for security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3604)|
| 1:00:11| And I think that he first wants to get to the truth and accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3611)|
| 1:00:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| Thank you, Ms. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| Some different topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| Now I have three people that I think they're speaking to the billboard issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| Joyce failed first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| Miss failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| And I suppose we'll give opportunity to these people when the issue comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| I think maybe that's what they interpreted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| because we're going to try to move the billboard towards the back of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| Duane Greve also to the same issue, billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3651)|
| 1:00:57| And Margo Klein to billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| So we'll call on those again later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| The next is one person we called on before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| Let's just go ahead and ask him if he'd like to speak now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| Lance McCold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| Thank you, Mr. McCold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| Thank you for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| I'm sorry for being late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| Name and address, please, Mr. McCold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| My name is Lance McCold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| I live in Knox County at 130 Cogdell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| And I wanted to speak to the election of school superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3688)|
| 1:01:33| When I first heard this, I thought, why in the world would anybody want to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3693)|
| 1:01:42| I'm still a little puzzled by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| I guess the only thing that I've heard that might suggest a reason people would want to do something like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3704)|
| 1:01:51| is an article I read in the Focus by a guy named Richie Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| It says that the school boards only offer limited accountability for the behavior of the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3715)|
| 1:02:07| And I think that's pretty turned upside down because it seems to me that they offer exceptional accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3727)|
| 1:02:15| much better accountability for a superintendent than if the superintendent were elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3735)|
| 1:02:23| A superintendent is a manager, and the superintendent doesn't set the direction for our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| The school board does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| The job of the superintendent is to run the schools according to the guidance from the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3749)|
| 1:02:37| So why should we want to elect somebody whose job is to be a manager?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3757)|
| 1:02:43| But speaking to the issue of why accountability, it seems to me that we've got a pretty doggone clear case that appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3763)|
| 1:02:56| superintendents are much more accountable to the populace than elected ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| You know, the previous superintendent, a fellow named Lindsey, if I recall correctly, was fired by the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3781)|
| 1:03:08| because it was time to get rid of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3788)|
| 1:03:09| Now, if he'd been elected, it would have been pretty darn difficult to get rid of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| Let me just give you some other examples I'm sure you're aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| A fellow named Lockett, who was elected as law director, he didn't come to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3799)|
| 1:03:27| He hired somebody to do his job for him while he stayed home or wherever he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| He had to be indicted before we could get rid of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| Now, if that were a school superintendent who didn't come to work, do you think the school board would keep him around any time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3815)|
| 1:03:42| This is ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| Now, we've got a trustee who played games with the rules and a bunch of his people got raises, including himself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3826)|
| 1:03:54| for something that they didn't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| Now, he's an elected person and he's not going to be pushed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| But, of course, the people who work for him who were not elected were pushed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| I'd say to you that the case for accountability under an appointed superintendent by an elected board is much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3844)|
| 1:04:17| So I would ask you to just forget this nonsense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| I don't think there's any good reason for electing superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| And the only bad reasons, well, I think there's several bad reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| One is you just want to inject politics into this issue and make sure that there's another elected office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3869)|
| 1:04:35| that people who want to play politics, who want to push their money around and try to push things their way, can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3875)|
| 1:04:45| So my comment is please say no to this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3889)|

| 1:04:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| I don't have anyone else signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| I don't think outside the billboard issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| Are there any other folks here that want to speak at public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=3907)|

| 1:09:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| Yeah, I'd just like to say just real quickly that those of us that have survived the Black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4169)|
| 1:09:41| Wednesday, Commissioner Norman and Commissioner Hammond were there that this is one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| individuals that doing phone surveys and whatnot and calling, this is one of the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| that really stood out, that his heart was in the right place if he wanted to serve Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| And I've visited with him and his wife on several occasions and I'm just thoroughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| impressed with your Christian leadership and civil leadership that you've given here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4205)|
| 1:10:06| Knox County could use a lot more people like you, William.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| A lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| I'd like to see you one day back up here as a commissioner one day or a countywide office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4210)|
| 1:10:14| holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| I think that much of you, you're in things for the right reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| And, Commissioner, I don't know if you know, but if you've talked to some of your constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| at the BZA, that this man here turned BZA around completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4222)|
| 1:10:26| I don't know if Roy is still here, but he used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| And people used to get a lot of things just approved, a drop of a hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| William put a stop to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| William said, what is your hardship?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| Why do you have to have this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| And he made people do some real soul searching and some contractors do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| And you've always done that in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| So I just really appreciate your leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| William, Mr. Daniels, would you like to say a couple of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| And I'd like to second that, what both Larry and Jeff had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4253)|
| 1:10:59| You have done extraordinary work on BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| And we greatly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| You know in our seat, if BZA doesn't take up the slack, it really affects us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4266)|
| 1:11:14| So we have heard very little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| I mean just very little at all since you were in the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| But go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| I want to see the little clock up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| I wish when I was on commission, you all would have had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| We wouldn't have gone from two in the afternoon to two in the morning, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4292)|
| 1:11:38| But in my life, I've been blessed many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4298)|
| 1:11:43| First of all, being able to accept Jesus my Lord and Savior was one of the main ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| Obviously the main one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| Meeting my wife would definitely qualify second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| And having two awesome daughters in Emily and Madison fall right behind her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4314)|
| 1:12:00| But close behind is being able to serve your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| And I've been so blessed to be able to sit there as a commissioner for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| And also to be able to serve as chairman of the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| Most people don't hear a whole lot about the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| But it affects every single citizen in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| A few bad decisions, a few bad votes, and the landscape of our community changes entirely because of BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4344)|
| 1:12:32| I've been blessed to serve with Cynthia Stancil, Marcus Chady, John Schoonmaker, Larry York, Bill Sewell, Kevin Murphy, Frank Grimshaw, and Carson Daly this last term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4352)|
| 1:12:48| And it's been a great honor to work with real professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| BZA is not compensated, but the folks on this board work like they're compensated for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4374)|
| 1:13:01| They act like it's their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| And it's neat to be able to serve with a group of people that take an appointed position seriously, that want to make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4383)|
| 1:13:12| And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Daniel Sanders from the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4392)|
| 1:13:18| But he's been phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| When I first took over as chairman, I told him that I felt we needed BZA to act like a professional organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4400)|
| 1:13:28| and challenge Daniel to help us understand all the laws and ordinances, and he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4408)|
| 1:13:34| And he's a fine man and a great legal mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| And none of this would have been possible without the folks I just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| It's not just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| It's everyone working together to make a better community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| So, commissioners, thank you all so much for believing in me, for backing me, for supporting me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4429)|
| 1:13:56| and giving me the opportunity to serve our community once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4440)|
| 1:14:08| Okay, commissioners, if it's all right, we'll just move on into the agenda, into our regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4448)|
| 1:14:16| I want to see if that's okay, if anybody needs to take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4456)|
| 1:14:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| Well, we've got to go ahead and proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| Okay, we have first call roll, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4468)|

| 1:14:43| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4483)|

| 1:14:45| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| Okay, of course, we have a quorum today for our devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| Jeff Owenby has, Commissioner Owenby has our devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| Go ahead, Mr. Owenby, and introduce our guest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| I'd like to introduce the leader of my church and a leader in this community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4502)|
| 1:15:14| And he's been a real good friend of mine, and I appreciate his service to our church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| and to our community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| But I ask Dr. Wade Bibb to lead our devotional today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4520)|
| 1:15:26| Thank you, Jeff, and thank you for giving me a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| You obviously have a very full agenda and many things to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| I'll just remind you that the last good Indiana Jones movie was not the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| It was the third one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| And in the third one, there's this wonderful scene where Harrison Ford, a sometime resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| of East Tennessee, ends up in this cave, and there are hundreds and hundreds of chalices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| And the evil archaeologist is trying to discover the right one, and he chooses the wrong one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| and he takes the drink of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| And through Hollywood magic, we watch him shrivel up and die and blow away, dust in the wind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4554)|
| 1:16:00| And there's this old knight who's been there forever, guarding, keeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4560)|
| 1:16:06| And he says he chose poorly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| It's the best line in the movie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| Backtrack just a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| There's this wonderful little book in the Hebrew Bible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| It's only 48 verses long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| It's about Jonah, who keeps choosing poorly, a very clear task to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4579)|
| 1:16:24| He flees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| God offers him a cruise that even residents of Carnival would think were worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4585)|
| 1:16:31| And he ends up at Nineveh, and he preaches a very angry sermon that I could never get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4591)|
| 1:16:37| by with preaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| And they actually repent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| And the book ends with Jonah sitting outside the city, very angry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| He would rather die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| It's a terrible thing, evidently, when your God forgives your enemies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| And so he's sitting there under a lean-to, waiting to see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| And there's a little line that says, and God appoints a bush, and this bush grows up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| And sometimes that's all I need, just a little rest, just a little shade from God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4619)|
| 1:17:05| a little time to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4625)|
| 1:17:06| And then, in chapter 4, verse 7, I think it's the funniest line in the entire Bible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4626)|
| 1:17:12| And it says, and God appointed a worm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4632)|
| 1:17:19| Might just be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| Might just be you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| God seems to be in the habit of choosing poorly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| People we would never suspect could get the job done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| People we would never suspect were capable or gifted enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| And this God of surprise keeps appointing amazing individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4660)|
| 1:17:47| So, thank you for the work you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| Every year, at Yom Kippur, at dusk, the Day of Atonement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| the Jewish community gathers and they read all 48 verses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| Because we need to be reminded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| Mercy goes a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| Repentance goes a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| And it turns out, just the right worm appointed goes a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4688)|
| 1:18:17| Might be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| Might be you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| Who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| Let's pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| God of us all, we are overwhelmed with all that must be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4705)|
| 1:18:32| May you bless these with wisdom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| with grace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| with vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| with courage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| with mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| Thank you, Dr. Bibb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| Appreciate you coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| Okay, Dr. Briggs, will you lead us in the pledge, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| Please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| Salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4744)|
| 1:19:09| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| one nation under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4755)|
| 1:19:23| I hear a motion to approve minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4768)|
| 1:19:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4769)|
| 1:19:30| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4771)|
| 1:19:32| Okay, for the amendments to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| I'd like to add a few things here first and then we'll take others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| First, I would like for Dave Wright to report from our joint committee on education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4779)|
| 1:19:48| that had their first committee meeting this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| And I did not take notes into the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| I didn't bring notes out of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| So I'll give a recount to the best of my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| but I'd also like to ask the other two commissioners that were there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4799)|
| 1:20:03| if they have anything to add at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| Did you have a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| Any comment to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| Yeah, that'll be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| I'm sure you'll have some other folks want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| And it's Mr. Hammond and Ms. Boyles and Mr. McKenzie that are also serving us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4818)|
| 1:20:23| on that joint committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| I'd also like to add school security as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| That's a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| And school security as a discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| just given the coverage this weekend and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| if that's agreeable to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| I'd like to move item 904, which is the billboard issue and resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4843)|
| 1:20:51| that's being brought by Mr. Anders to 445.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| 445, 445 being the time, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| So we've got time for everybody to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| There were some calls about that coming up before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| you know, at some earlier time they wouldn't be able to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| I don't know whether that's going to happen or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| But is that okay with the board to move that just before zonings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| It's really, you know, in concert with the zoning issue on billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4879)|
| 1:21:24| Yeah, I'd like to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| Go ahead, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| To me, it seems more than just in concert with zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| It seems like it is zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| And, you know, I think we could get ourselves twisted here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| If actions take place at this point that affects something in zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| it might, you know, predestine or just totally mess up what's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4903)|
| 1:21:50| So to me, it seemed like it would be part of zonings that would happen at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| But I'll come to the law director and see if that's what his view is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| Okay, Mr. Law Director, would you weigh in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| It could be placed in either part on the agenda at the pleasure of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| It was presented as a resolution rather than a zoning item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| The reason it was put on the agenda as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| But it's entirely up to this body if you want to move it to be in concert with the corresponding zoning resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4934)|
| 1:22:22| So without objection, we'll move it on into zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4942)|
| 1:22:29| So hearing none, that'll be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| I'd also like to add as a discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| we've got five weeks in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| And during our pension board meeting this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| it was brought to my attention that we could move our commission meeting possibly in April to the last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4964)|
| 1:22:53| That would allow some of us to attend a conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| So anyway, I just want to add that as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4976)|
| 1:23:00| I'll be thinking about that, whether that's going to be a hardship for somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4980)|
| 1:23:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| Other items to, other amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4992)|
| 1:23:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4993)|
| 1:23:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| I'd like to add on a discussion item as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4995)|
| 1:23:18| I know this will need to go before the finance committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| but I would like to get some discussion on it today where you can be thinking about the school security problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5001)|
| 1:23:29| and this audit, whatever they're calling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5014)|

| 1:34:22| We enjoy hearing you read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| Let's try 902 on page 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| Expressing support of SB748-HB420 to permit, beginning with elections of school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5669)|
| 1:34:37| in 2014, county governing bodies by two-thirds vote to choose to elect county school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5677)|
| 1:34:44| members on a partisan rather than a nonpartisan basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5689)|
| 1:34:50| Mr. Wright, would you like to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| Okay, we have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| We're on 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5700)|
| 1:35:06| Okay, we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| I had a, well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| I had a discussion with Senator Massey, asking if she could come to our luncheon today, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5716)|
| 1:35:23| she regretfully said that they had a meeting prior in Nashville with luncheon and she would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| not be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| And so, I just basically was talking with her about this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5728)|
| 1:35:32| I don't really have a whole lot of heartburn over the partisan thing, except that I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5732)|
| 1:35:41| like for us to kind of step back for a moment, because we're looking at something that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| going to affect all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| And I would like to see us have some public hearings on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| I would like to see us get more public involvement in terms of hearing what the public has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| We've gotten a few emails and some phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| But for us to take this on, I would like to hear what the school board has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5761)|
| 1:36:05| I feel that since it affects them directly, I would like to know their thoughts and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5765)|
| 1:36:10| I would like to hear from those in the education community, those outside the education community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5770)|
| 1:36:14| I'd like to hear from Republicans and Democrats and everybody that would be directly involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5774)|
| 1:36:18| in this, because everybody would be directly involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| And so, she told me that there was no hurry in terms of getting it done today, but she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5781)|
| 1:36:29| needed some kind of guidance if she was going to move forward with it in the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| And so, I know that it says that this would be for the elections in 2014, but we've gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5793)|
| 1:36:38| through several elections, partisan anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| And so, I'd like to make a substitute motion that we lay this on the table and that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| And if we are going to consider it, then let's take a look at it in terms of doing some public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| hearings and getting more public involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| So, my substitute motion would be that we lay it on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5812)|
| 1:36:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5817)|
| 1:36:58| It was subbed for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5818)|
| 1:36:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| So, we're moving towards our that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5824)|
| 1:37:08| And I think Mr. McKenzie had his light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5828)|
| 1:37:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| You know, I do have heartburn with this one, but I agree with what Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5834)|
| 1:37:22| said in that, you know, this process, this feels rushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| It seems, you know, kind of spurious and off the cuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5846)|
| 1:37:32| And we've gotten a lot of, everyone knows, you know, I'm not a big counting emails and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5852)|
| 1:37:37| trying to say this many emails came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| So, therefore, every citizen of Knox County is either for or against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| But, you know, it's been overwhelming in one direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| But I don't think that's enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| I do think that if we're going to take something this substantial that we start a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5869)|
| 1:37:56| But to the motion on the floor, my biggest issue with what's before us is just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5876)|
| 1:38:06| Why is this before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| Why we instigated this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| You can point it whichever direction you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5890)|
| 1:38:15| Senator Massey is simply carrying the mail for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| So, this is coming out of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| Last year I introduced a measure to censor Stacey Canfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5902)|
| 1:38:31| And he's been even a worse actor than he was last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| And what came out of this commission wasn't we disagree with you, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5915)|
| 1:38:40| What came out of this commission was we need to let the state handle the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5920)|
| 1:38:45| And so, you know, I was tempted to introduce a substitute motion to censor him again for his actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5925)|
| 1:38:52| in this legislative session because supposedly none of our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5932)|
| 1:38:58| But this isn't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| You know, as we talked about a little earlier, I do think we need to take care of our own house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5940)|
| 1:39:05| We have several pressing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| This isn't one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| This is a state issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| If the state chooses to move something forward like this, then I think that that's up to the people that we elect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5949)|
| 1:39:16| to the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| So, but I do believe that we've not heard enough from enough people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5958)|
| 1:39:25| We haven't done enough studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| As we've said, there's two or three states that do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| I don't think those are states that we're trying to get to in our quest to be the best school system in the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5970)|
| 1:39:38| I don't see any of those states listed in those, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5978)|
| 1:39:44| I mean, you can argue Florida, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| But I still think that we are getting ahead of ourselves, that we're operating outside of what the norms is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5987)|
| 1:39:59| I mean, if a constituent brought it to us, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| But she's, I've heard in sound bites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6002)|
| 1:40:05| she won't act unless the commission says act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6005)|
| 1:40:08| So the commission is driving this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| And I don't think that's the way we need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| If it's a state-driven thing, if it's a state opportunity to do it, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6013)|
| 1:40:18| But for us to drive it, I think, is a bit overreaching and overzealous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6018)|
| 1:40:24| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| Thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| Dr. Briggs, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| Go ahead, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6030)|
| 1:40:31| I was going to agree with both of you in a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6031)|
| 1:40:36| You know, quite frankly, I don't think it's such a big deal whether we have partisan or nonpartisan elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| If someone doesn't want to run as a Democrat or Republican, let them run as an independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6041)|
| 1:40:47| It's just another piece of information that can be found out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| If anybody wants to find out how a person's voted in the past, they can check their voting record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6050)|
| 1:40:55| The only trouble is, is for the average citizen, that's a lot of trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| One of the reasons I'll probably end up voting for it, Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| but the only reason I hate to get into a very involved process now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| it's really almost a meaningless vote because we're just giving an indication to the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6067)|
| 1:41:13| If the state legislature did pass a code that said they would send it back to the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6073)|
| 1:41:21| and then we would decide, I think it is a big deal then and we should have the public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| But this is almost just, to a certain extent, it's a meaningless gesture at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6086)|
| 1:41:33| And I hate to have a lot of public hearings over something that doesn't carry a whole lot of weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| Now, if it comes back after the state legislature has passed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6097)|
| 1:41:42| and we're actually making a decision to do something, then it is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| But that's the only reason I hate to get into a whole series of public hearings all over the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| and do all that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| I mean, you know, it just doesn't have a lot of weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| But I would support, if it came through that with the legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6116)|
| 1:42:01| to go ahead and have that listed as a party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6121)|
| 1:42:04| It's public information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| It can be found out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6125)|
| 1:42:06| And I'm reminded what the New Sentinel said about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| They said, give light and the people will find the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| What this is, is just hiding another aspect of a person's political leanings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| and whether we like it or not, the school board is a political position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6136)|
| 1:42:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| Thank you, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6143)|
| 1:42:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6144)|
| 1:42:25| Commissioner Wright, I have a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| And you can choose to take it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| It will not hurt my feelings one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| His motion is not on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| His motion is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6153)|
| 1:42:34| We'll talk about that in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6158)|
| 1:42:39| Ms. Royles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| Mike, how long do you want this to lay on the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| Have you got a time frame you're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| No time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| And, Rick, actually, this does carry a lot of weight, as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6169)|
| 1:42:54| because she has said she will not take it to the state legislature unless we ask her to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6174)|
| 1:43:00| So now is when it counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| Now is when the vote counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6185)|
| 1:43:06| I think Sam mentioned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| But she's indicated she's not going to take this to the state unless we ask her to with our vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6188)|
| 1:43:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6195)|
| 1:43:16| Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| You know, this one is not as easy for me as the other one is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| But if Ms. Massey, she brought this bill forward, what's the number of commissioners if we agree that she's going to carry the bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6201)|
| 1:43:30| I mean, it's – I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6210)|
| 1:43:35| I mean, is she already wanting the two-thirds of the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6215)|
| 1:43:38| She wants, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6218)|
| 1:43:39| I mean, if she – again, I won't agree with – I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman, I didn't mean to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6223)|
| 1:43:44| Ms. Royles is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6224)|
| 1:43:45| Ms. Senator Massey told me that she's not going to act unless she gets direction from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6225)|
| 1:43:49| So, yes, the vote today does matter, but it has to be two-thirds, she said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| And two-thirds, according to the new charter amendment, is eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| Well, you know, what Dr. Briggs was saying, if we can find out information about candidates and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6236)|
| 1:44:06| if this is what's been called a power grab, then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| the Republican Party has ran limited school board members in the past six years that I can recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6251)|
| 1:44:18| them even claiming to be Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| And so, I don't understand what we gain by going to a partisan election on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6261)|
| 1:44:27| I just can't – I can't see the positive in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6267)|
| 1:44:31| If you can tell me where a school board that operates better than ours or it's just a better way of doing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6271)|
| 1:44:40| But nobody can point to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6280)|
| 1:44:41| They can just say, we need partisan elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| And I can't – if the Republican Party is not going to put forward Republican candidates in a nonpartisan race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6283)|
| 1:44:51| why are we going to put it forward in a partisan race?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| And so, I don't understand what we're trying to get at and why Ms. Massey is carrying the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6295)|
| 1:45:02| I mean, who's asked her to carry the bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| I mean, where did it come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| Do we know specifically where the request came from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6305)|
| 1:45:14| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| What's on the floor right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6318)|
| 1:45:19| Table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| Okay, so I'm just going to discuss whether to table it or not, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6322)|
| 1:45:26| Please speak to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6326)|
| 1:45:30| Not literally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| I'm going to whisper to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| I will not support tabling the issue because this is a House Bill 420 by Representative Dunn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6334)|
| 1:45:46| This is a Senate Bill 748 sponsored by Massey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6346)|
| 1:45:52| And I believe if we table it, if we go into collecting public input, when I say again, we've talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6352)|
| 1:46:02| this, to me, has been an issue out of the 8th District every spring that I have been here on County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6362)|
| 1:46:09| So everyone here today has an opinion of whether this is a good idea or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6369)|
| 1:46:15| So the reason I will oppose tabling it is so that we can look at it and vote on it on whatever we feel like its merits might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6375)|
| 1:46:25| The question that's been raised about, and I think now I have to talk to the bill for just a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6385)|
| 1:46:32| because of Commissioner Anders' statement that he might not know why this should be something of issue at this particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6392)|
| 1:46:46| The bill as it's proposed, and I think I have a copy of the Senate bill because we were asked this question earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6406)|
| 1:46:54| The only thing, it's very short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| I'll hold this up so people can see it's very short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| And it says that the local legislative body by two-thirds vote can have partisan school board races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6421)|
| 1:47:19| The only reason I think that it is important is, and I've got to back up now, to the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6439)|
| 1:47:30| We had a night in which we had Charter Review discussing the fact that school board races, nonpartisan, normally short list of candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6450)|
| 1:47:42| and the primaries were so early in the year and the elections were so late in the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6462)|
| 1:47:48| let's go ahead and just get the school board people installed up closer to the election because there's no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6468)|
| 1:47:55| there's not many races in which there were races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6475)|
| 1:48:07| I look at that as being an indictment of us not having people on the ballot because then you don't have to stand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6487)|
| 1:48:15| and say what you think, what you believe, where you'd like to see Knox County go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| Now, some here tonight or this afternoon have compared it to districts that are purely Republican or purely Democrat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6499)|
| 1:48:28| Well, I've been, I've faced challenges in the 8th District and it's primarily Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6508)|
| 1:48:35| There are still challengers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| But on the school board races, I don't really see that so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| So I only bring this up as a point that I believe it was recognized in the Charter Review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6522)|
| 1:48:48| that there were occasionally not many candidates on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6528)|
| 1:48:55| And I believe it would be good for us to have candidates that then have to stand up in public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6535)|
| 1:49:06| and talk about their position and where they'd like to see Knox County headed as far as school board races go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6546)|
| 1:49:12| So, again, I'll not support this tabling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6552)|
| 1:49:16| I believe that we are here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| We can take a position one way or another and either get, if this is what's being required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6558)|
| 1:49:25| get Senator Massey off the bubble here, because if it only takes one constituent to light a fire under a senator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6565)|
| 1:49:37| well, I'll have to admit I've spoke to her about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6577)|
| 1:49:45| Okay, Ms. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| Well, I'm going to argue the other side of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| and that in school board races and in county commission races,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| you often have races where there's nobody running against an incumbent in a primary or in a general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6594)|
| 1:50:01| We see that whether it's a partisan race or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6601)|
| 1:50:04| I also think that the Charter Review Committee did discuss this and decided that everything's just fine the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6604)|
| 1:50:12| They decided not to act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| They did decide to act on a host of other things, however, but they thought were more necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6615)|
| 1:50:25| I also think that one of the great things about a nonpartisan election is that the candidates do have to stand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6625)|
| 1:50:33| and say what they think, what they believe, and what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6633)|
| 1:50:38| Because they can't just say, well, I'm a Republican, so I'm up for all the Republican stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6638)|
| 1:50:44| or I'm a Democrat, so I'm for all the Democratic stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| They have to actually speak, and the voters have to actually do some homework to figure out where people stand on issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6647)|
| 1:50:57| and on issues concerning education, which I think are some of the most important that our community deals with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6657)|
| 1:51:04| So that argument could go either way, I guess, depending on which way you prefer to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6664)|
| 1:51:11| I prefer the nonpartisan because I think it gets us better vetting of candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6671)|
| 1:51:17| and better people serving on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6677)|
| 1:51:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| Thank you, Ms. Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| Any other discussion of our item that's before us to table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6683)|
| 1:51:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6689)|
| 1:51:30| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| The motion is to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| I just want you to understand once you vote on the table, it takes two-thirds votes to bring something off of the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6694)|
| 1:51:41| So this is not a standard motion that you're voting on where a majority will move it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6701)|
| 1:51:47| So I just wanted you to understand what the rules are you're operating under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6707)|
| 1:51:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| Well, let's, if there's no other discussion, let's go ahead and start, do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6715)|
| 1:52:02| Let's start with Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6725)|

| 1:52:08| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| Commissioner Broyles passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6732)|
| 1:52:13| Commissioner Owenby votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| Commissioner Briggs votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6738)|
| 1:52:21| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| Commissioner Anders votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6743)|
| 1:52:24| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| Commissioner Smith votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6747)|
| 1:52:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| Commissioner Wright votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6751)|
| 1:52:32| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6752)|
| 1:52:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6753)|
| 1:52:34| Commissioner Brown votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6755)|
| 1:52:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| Commissioner Hammond votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6758)|
| 1:52:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6759)|
| 1:52:40| Commissioner Shouse votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6761)|
| 1:52:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6762)|
| 1:52:43| Commissioner Norman votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6763)|
| 1:52:44| Does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6764)|
| 1:52:45| I vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6765)|
| 1:52:46| Commissioner Broyles votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6766)|
| 1:52:47| Okay, so we have six to five to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6767)|
| 1:53:12| So this item is tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6792)|
| 1:53:18| Realizing we need two-thirds vote to bring it off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| And when does that occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6801)|
| 1:53:27| When the prevailing side wishes to bring it back up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| We rarely have a tabled item at this body, very rarely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6813)|
| 1:53:39| Mr. Law Director, will you study and see if the prevailing side has to, I mean, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6819)|
| 1:53:43| know if the prevailing side has to bring it back up, but if you'll review the rules for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6827)|
| 1:53:48| I know it is a reconsideration vote, but a table may not be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6832)|
| 1:53:53| I'll check on it, but I think that the prevailing side has to bring it up off the top of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6836)|
| 1:53:57| But I'll check on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6837)|
| 1:53:58| Yeah, because usually what we do on things like that, we'll just defer it for 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6840)|
| 1:54:01| So this is a little different than what we normally do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6841)|
| 1:54:04| We'll be talking about it tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6849)|

| 1:54:18| state of Tennessee, Resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6861)|
| 1:54:24| May I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6868)|
| 1:54:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6869)|
| 1:54:30| Discussion on elected superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6870)|
| 1:54:33| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6873)|
| 1:54:37| Go ahead, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| Today's Resolution 13-2-903 is not about Alan Morgan, Charles Lindsay, or Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6882)|
| 1:54:49| This resolution is about the process of selecting the single person in charge of allocating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6889)|
| 1:54:55| a more than $400 million budget with transparency and fairness as the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6895)|
| 1:55:02| Knox County is a figment of the imagination of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6902)|
| 1:55:07| We are an extension of state government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6907)|
| 1:55:11| We commissioners are given guidelines on almost all of, well, no, let me rephrase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6911)|
| 1:55:16| We commissioners are given guidelines on all of our activity and develop policy within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6916)|
| 1:55:22| the constraints of the state and the people that have elected us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6922)|
| 1:55:28| Every spring, the same theme has risen in the 8th District concerning the process of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6928)|
| 1:55:33| selecting the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| In the past, I've talked with Frank Knisely or Ryan Haynes or Harry Brooks, well, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6935)|
| 1:55:41| others, but this year also including Senator Becky Duncan Massey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6941)|
| 1:55:48| The state legislature this year, again, has a fair amount of bills concerning education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6948)|
| 1:55:55| all being discussed on how to make the system work better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6955)|
| 1:56:01| The message that we have here before us today is that we can't afford to say to the electorate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6961)|
| 1:56:08| you are incapable of making an informed decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| So we commission, we'll have to make that decision for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6972)|
| 1:56:19| The discussion of the election of the superintendent or the qualifications of the office or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6979)|
| 1:56:27| process for implementation, any and all these issues that are related to Senate Bill 916| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6987)|
| 1:56:38| or House Bill 741 are just the opening of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=6998)|
| 1:56:50| This one is page after page after page, and it has within it two-thirds votes here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7010)|
| 1:56:58| and the decision made by the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7018)|
| 1:57:07| So I move the passage of Resolution 13-2-903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7027)|
| 1:57:14| That's all I was going to say until we had some comments made by people here assembled in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7034)|
| 1:57:24| And I'd first like to say that I can appreciate your anger at me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7044)|
| 1:57:32| but I guess you're angry at me for representing the people in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7052)|
| 1:57:37| To those people that I represent that elected me, this is not nonsense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7057)|
| 1:57:44| This is requesting, making a valid request to the state of Tennessee and the state of Tennessee acting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7064)|
| 1:57:54| And then the one that I liked the best was I already had it written down, but, Dr. Briggs, I don't elect a doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7074)|
| 1:58:05| I believe what was said here was that we don't elect a dentist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7085)|
| 1:58:11| But the thing about it is you look at the ballot every time that you might think about a dentist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7091)|
| 1:58:16| whether it be the yellow pages or the one you've dealt with before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| but you elect or reelect that person every time you go see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| So if I look at it in the right context, it's about whether or not we, Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7104)|
| 1:58:34| stand between the electorate of Knox County and being able to make this choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7114)|
| 1:58:42| And then I might add one more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7122)|
| 1:58:47| There are a lot of e-mails and there are a few phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7127)|
| 1:58:54| but I think the most informed phone call that I received was from a former road commissioner of Union County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7134)|
| 1:59:05| And he said if it was important enough that it be allowed to, by the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7145)|
| 1:59:11| that the road commissioner could be elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| then surely the superintendent of schools was an important enough election that the citizens of Union County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7154)|
| 1:59:22| be allowed to make that choice whether Knox County chose to do so or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7162)|
| 1:59:28| So with that in mind, I again ask you to send this resolution on to the people in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7168)|
| 1:59:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7179)|
| 1:59:40| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7183)|
| 1:59:44| This is where I believe that Commissioner Briggs and I would agree, and that is this is a statewide issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7184)|
| 1:59:51| This does not affect only Knox County, but all 95 counties in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7191)|
| 1:59:55| So it's a state issue, which Senator Nicely has put before the Senate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| and I don't know who's carrying the House bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| As you mentioned, this is 14 pages long, and when you look at the nuances of this bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7201)|
| 2:00:09| they're talking about the fact that the state board would establish minimum requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7209)|
| 2:00:13| for the qualification for a superintendent, which would include a bachelor's degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7213)|
| 2:00:17| or a teacher's professional license, it says, with endorsement as principal or supervisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7217)|
| 2:00:22| holding a master's degree in education to include school organization administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7222)|
| 2:00:28| supervision, curriculum development evaluation, school finance, housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7228)|
| 2:00:33| Why housing is in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7233)|
| 2:00:34| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7234)|
| 2:00:35| And transportation, school and communication relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7235)|
| 2:00:38| They're talking about buildings when they talk about housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| And techniques of problem solving by group process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| And you only have to have five years, according to this bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7243)|
| 2:00:46| It says they shall have five years' experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| And, of course, anybody that met those qualifications could run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7249)|
| 2:00:53| But there's also in the back, when you look at it, it said that during the course of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7253)|
| 2:00:57| if it were to pass, that if the legislative body were to determine that they didn't like the election process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7257)|
| 2:01:03| then all they had to do was by two-thirds vote of the body could go right back and go back to the appointed process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7263)|
| 2:01:10| So this gives the county commission quite a bit of power, I guess you could say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7270)|
| 2:01:16| with regards to the selection of the school superintendent, whether it is appointed or whether it is elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7276)|
| 2:01:22| I guess my point is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7282)|
| 2:01:25| Because this is a state thing, and I understand I wasn't at the breakfast Friday morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7285)|
| 2:01:30| but Governor Haslam was asked directly about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7290)|
| 2:01:32| The governor said he's going to veto it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7292)|
| 2:01:34| So, to me, let's let the state decide this and decide what they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7294)|
| 2:01:39| And if it passes and the governor vetoes it, if they override his veto, then it comes to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7299)|
| 2:01:45| and then we can have all kinds of robust discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7305)|
| 2:01:48| I'm going to make a substitute motion that we lay this on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7308)|
| 2:01:51| until we see what the state is going to do or until the state acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7311)|
| 2:01:55| And at that point, we can always bring it back, and then we'll have that robust discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7315)|
| 2:01:59| But right now, I see no reason for us to even be discussing this when the state is going to have to act on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7319)|
| 2:02:04| and the governor said he's going to veto it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7324)|
| 2:02:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7326)|
| 2:02:07| So that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7327)|
| 2:02:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| Ms. Boyles, was that a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7332)|
| 2:02:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7333)|
| 2:02:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7335)|
| 2:02:16| Now we have the same pact for this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7336)|
| 2:02:21| Did you have something, Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7341)|
| 2:02:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7344)|
| 2:02:25| You know, in that same vein of trying to get a deeper understanding as to why we're where we are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7345)|
| 2:02:34| I know that the school board, they had education on the Hill there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7354)|
| 2:02:38| I see a couple of school board members that they're encouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7358)|
| 2:02:42| There may be others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7362)|
| 2:02:43| If they'd like to come, I'd just like to get an idea as to what the nature of the dialogue was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7363)|
| 2:02:49| I'm sure you all met with the state folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7369)|
| 2:02:52| I know I'm putting you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| You all don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7374)|
| 2:02:55| But I guess what I'm trying to find out is, you know, were you all a part of the initial process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7375)|
| 2:03:02| Did this come to you the same way it came to us via, you know, media?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7382)|
| 2:03:08| And what are your general kind of thoughts about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7388)|
| 2:03:12| Because, you know, we do education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7392)|
| 2:03:14| We spend a lot of our time dealing with education from a fiduciary standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7394)|
| 2:03:20| But, you know, it's pretty much you all's life and passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7400)|
| 2:03:24| So, you know, I'm just trying to get an understanding on where we are, where the Knotts County School Board is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7404)|
| 2:03:35| Because, again, I think this is something that is a state issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7415)|
| 2:03:39| So if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7421)|
| 2:03:42| It's Karen Carson, Knotts County Board Chair, 10953 Twin Harbor, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7422)|
| 2:03:49| If I'm understanding your question correctly, Commissioner, yes, we were up in Nashville last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7429)|
| 2:03:55| and met with a fair amount of our delegation, our representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7435)|
| 2:04:01| The school board has gone on record as being opposed to elected superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7441)|
| 2:04:07| We've had lengthy debates about this on our board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7447)|
| 2:04:11| It's an issue that does come up every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7451)|
| 2:04:13| And, you know, it's one that we've got clarity on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7453)|
| 2:04:18| The issue of partisan is a new issue that came up after we had our legislative priorities already voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7458)|
| 2:04:25| We were not in a voting session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| We did bring it up for discussion in our last workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7467)|
| 2:04:30| Talked about it until there was no more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7470)|
| 2:04:36| And without objection from anybody on the board, I said that we would present to our representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7476)|
| 2:04:43| that we were not in support of a partisan school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7483)|
| 2:04:47| I mean, a partisan school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| One of the things that I think is important for us in this discussion is there is a tremendous amount of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7490)|
| 2:04:56| in our county, in our state, and in our country in education reform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7496)|
| 2:05:01| I firmly believe that's where the focus needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7501)|
| 2:05:07| I look at each issue like this and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| how does this move us forward in meeting the objective that we've set for education reform?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7509)|
| 2:05:18| I've yet to get an answer back that tells me how it does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7518)|
| 2:05:22| I can tell you that in looking at our superintendents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7522)|
| 2:05:27| it is important in when you're totally changing up the delivery of education to meet the demands that exist today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7527)|
| 2:05:37| that it be strategic, that it be planned, and that it be developed with the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7537)|
| 2:05:44| When you're looking at changing that person every four years, potentially with an election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7544)|
| 2:05:50| it makes that strategic planning very, very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7550)|
| 2:05:53| And I can give you all of the reasons that the board has that I know you have all heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7553)|
| 2:05:58| But to me, that's one of the most significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7558)|
| 2:06:02| This issue does nothing to further enhance the focus of what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7562)|
| 2:06:09| and I would hope that our efforts are spent on how do we implement those things that we know we have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7569)|
| 2:06:17| to make education in Knox County the best that it can be and achieve what our common goal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7577)|
| 2:06:26| I hope that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7586)|
| 2:06:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7587)|
| 2:06:29| You know, when I came back to Knoxville after college,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7589)|
| 2:06:38| the big thing on the agenda at the time was the OCR and the desegregation lawsuit that was brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7598)|
| 2:06:46| And, you know, we did a whole lot of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| but we were operating under an elected superintendent at the time and probably a partisan school board as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7608)|
| 2:06:55| But the thing I remember is, uninformed, but I just thought it strange for a desegregation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7615)|
| 2:07:03| The three schools, the three high schools that they shut down, South Young, Rural High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7623)|
| 2:07:08| and Holston High School, had the most diverse populations in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7628)|
| 2:07:13| Those schools were integrated, fully integrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7633)|
| 2:07:16| People getting along beautifully in terms of race relations, gender relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7636)|
| 2:07:22| From that, they may have had some other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| But those are the three schools that they chose to shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7644)|
| 2:07:28| And I just got to say, that was probably political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| It probably was political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7651)|
| 2:07:33| And as I've dug into it, you know, subsequently, that was a lot of the drivers for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7653)|
| 2:07:39| It was a thing of who has the most county commissioners leaning their way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7659)|
| 2:07:44| who has the most school board members leaning that way, can I influence the superintendent, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7664)|
| 2:07:49| And that whole dynamic, I'm not pointing out anyone individually, but that's where we ended up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7669)|
| 2:07:55| So when you look at that, you know, 20 years later or 10 years later, however long it's been, that just strikes me as odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7675)|
| 2:08:04| So I would like to get into a situation where our superintendent, if he starts down a road we don't like, we can fire him tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7684)|
| 2:08:12| They can fire him tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7692)|
| 2:08:13| That would be a financial implication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| But we can act swiftly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7695)|
| 2:08:18| That is accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7698)|
| 2:08:21| And if those school board members start to hear, and that's probably what happened last time, start to hear rhetoric,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7701)|
| 2:08:28| we're not liking the way the schools are going, then we'll have another search,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7708)|
| 2:08:33| like we did when we brought in the current superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7713)|
| 2:08:36| So the process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7716)|
| 2:08:38| I think it works well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7718)|
| 2:08:39| You know, I think, you know, when I saw the appointment of this particular superintendent, it was an exhaustive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7719)|
| 2:08:47| And I just think it worked very well for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7727)|
| 2:08:50| The process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7730)|
| 2:08:52| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7732)|
| 2:08:54| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7734)|
| 2:08:56| I want to give just a few thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7736)|
| 2:08:58| It's what I call the 50,000-foot view of sort of the advantages and disadvantages maybe of the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7738)|
| 2:09:06| I'm not going to take a particular position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7746)|
| 2:09:09| But I think you can get a very good superintendent when you elect one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7749)|
| 2:09:14| You can get a very good superintendent when you appoint one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7754)|
| 2:09:17| And you can get a very bad one when you appoint one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| And you can get some bad ones when you elect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7759)|
| 2:09:22| And even though through the best efforts of some very intelligent people, you can still have problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7762)|
| 2:09:27| And I'll give the example of the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7767)|
| 2:09:31| If you recall, the way the University of Tennessee selects the president of the university is they usually get some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7771)|
| 2:09:39| best search firms, headhunting firms in the country to go out and find candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7779)|
| 2:09:44| They vet them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7784)|
| 2:09:45| It comes back before a board that's appointed, a UT faculty, part of the Board of Trustees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7785)|
| 2:09:51| Ultimately, it's appointed by the Board of Trustees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7791)|
| 2:09:54| But if you look over the last 20 years, you know, what have we had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7794)|
| 2:09:59| We had, and I hate to always mention names, but you had Dr. Gilly, who ran into some problems and had to be relieved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7799)|
| 2:10:07| We replaced him with Dr. Shoemaker, who didn't even last a year before we found that he was spending money very unwisely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7807)|
| 2:10:15| and he had some unethical things that were going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7815)|
| 2:10:18| Dr. Peterson, I don't think anyone questioned his ethics, but he was an effective president that we liked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7818)|
| 2:10:25| And these were people that we brought in from the outside that certainly over a very short period of time, it was three strikes and you're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7825)|
| 2:10:34| If you look at some of the UT presidents that we had prior to that, we had Dr. Andy Holt, who was president for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7834)|
| 2:10:41| We had Ed Bolling, Lamar Alexander, and Joe Johnson, who I think people would say those were very good presidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7841)|
| 2:10:48| So we've had both very good people and some very bad people also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7848)|
| 2:10:53| The problem that I've seen here in Knox County with what we have with our present system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7853)|
| 2:11:04| and I do say I think that the school board, who are elected by the citizens to pick an appointed superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7864)|
| 2:11:14| is that I think they made a very good choice with Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7874)|
| 2:11:19| I don't think they could have made a better choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7879)|
| 2:11:21| I think Dr. McIntyre has come up with a very strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7881)|
| 2:11:25| It's very well thought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7885)|
| 2:11:26| It's the type of plan, if implemented, we could see the type of progress in the schools that we would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7886)|
| 2:11:34| The problem is that when you bring any strategic plan on board, it has to be first a good plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7894)|
| 2:11:40| but then the second phase of that is implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| And this is where we've ran into some problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7903)|
| 2:11:47| And it's not through a lack of the school board's effort or the lack of Dr. McIntyre's effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7907)|
| 2:11:53| It's just that the superintendent does not have the bully pulpit of saying, I have the county's people behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7913)|
| 2:12:00| Part of the criticism that we have of having an elected president or elected superintendent is they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7920)|
| 2:12:07| well, we don't want him to go out there door to door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7927)|
| 2:12:08| We don't want him to go out there and have to explain his policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7928)|
| 2:12:11| We don't want him to have to go out there and sell those to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7931)|
| 2:12:14| And maybe that's what he needs to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7934)|
| 2:12:16| We would not have to do that if we had the superintendent forming policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7936)|
| 2:12:20| and then he had an ally in one of the county-wide elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7940)|
| 2:12:26| And I'll give the example of the mayors where the mayor could use the power of the bully pulpit saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7946)|
| 2:12:31| I was elected by the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7951)|
| 2:12:32| He could come in front of the commission and get behind good policy that the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7952)|
| 2:12:38| and the superintendent have developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7958)|
| 2:12:41| And we don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7961)|
| 2:12:43| And that's part of the problem we ran into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| We talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7965)|
| 2:12:46| We can have the best strategic plan in the world, but if we can't sell it to the public, it's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7966)|
| 2:12:52| And I think that's somewhat what we ran into last year is where we had a plan that I think we would have seen the type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7972)|
| 2:13:00| of leap forward in progress that we would want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7980)|
| 2:13:04| But I also believe that some of the polls, some of the public opinion polls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7984)|
| 2:13:09| indicated that two-thirds of the people, for whatever reason, were not behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7989)|
| 2:13:15| Abraham Lincoln said public opinion is everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7995)|
| 2:13:19| He said without public opinion, you can't accomplish anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=7999)|
| 2:13:21| and we didn't have public opinion behind that last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8001)|
| 2:13:25| And those are just a couple of thoughts that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8005)|
| 2:13:28| The one thing that I do like that's in the bill is that the county commission has a two-thirds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8008)|
| 2:13:35| with a two-thirds vote can go back to the old process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8015)|
| 2:13:38| so we do have a way of removing a superintendent that does something wrong or is not effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8018)|
| 2:13:45| And I think my time is up in about ten seconds, and those are just some thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| I'm going to stop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8028)|
| 2:13:49| And it's just some observations that I've made on some of the problems that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8029)|
| 2:13:54| on getting good policy implemented in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8034)|
| 2:13:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8036)|
| 2:14:00| Okay, Mr. Wright, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8040)|
| 2:14:03| What's before us now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8043)|
| 2:14:04| Table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8044)|
| 2:14:05| I will oppose tabling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8045)|
| 2:14:08| Okay, any discussion on the substitute motion to table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8048)|

| 2:14:15| Okay, let's start on the other side for our roll call with Mr. Shouse, if we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8055)|

| 2:15:04| And so the law director will weigh in on that one also about how that comes back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8104)|
| 2:15:09| how and when that comes back before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8109)|
| 2:15:13| Break time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8113)|
| 2:15:15| Okay, Mr. Brown has declared it's time for a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8115)|
| 2:15:21| We've got discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8121)|
| 2:15:22| So let's take ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8122)|
| 2:15:25| Ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8125)|
| 2:15:26| Be back at 3.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8126)|
| 2:15:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8127)|
| 2:15:29| Commissioners, if you would have a seat, let's go ahead and resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8129)|
| 2:15:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8152)|
| 2:16:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8182)|
| 2:16:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8212)|
| 2:17:22| Okay, commissioners, let's have a seat and move ahead on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8242)|
| 2:17:34| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8254)|
| 2:17:37| Resolution 905 on page 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8257)|
| 2:17:45| Respectfully requesting the Knox County Legislative Delegation to take all necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8265)|
| 2:17:50| and appropriate steps to secure legislation for South Knoxville businesses to receive temporary tax relief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8270)|
| 2:17:56| due to the extended closure of the Henley Street Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8276)|
| 2:18:00| Okay, we'll wait for Mr. Brown to get over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8280)|
| 2:18:06| If it's proper, can I make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8286)|
| 2:18:08| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8288)|
| 2:18:09| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8289)|
| 2:18:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8290)|
| 2:18:11| Do we have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8291)|
| 2:18:12| Mr. Brown, would you like to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8292)|
| 2:18:16| No, I just appreciate that we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8296)|
| 2:18:18| Go ahead and send a recommendation to the state that they support the mayor's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8298)|
| 2:18:26| Okay, so the motion is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8306)|
| 2:18:28| Properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8308)|
| 2:18:29| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8309)|
| 2:18:31| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8311)|
| 2:18:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8313)|
| 2:18:34| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8314)|
| 2:18:35| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8315)|
| 2:18:38| Okay, Madam Clerk, are we to discussion items now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8318)|
| 2:18:42| First discussion item is a report on the Joint Educational Committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8322)|
| 2:18:47| Okay, Mr. Wright, would you go ahead and start us out with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8327)|
| 2:18:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8332)|
| 2:18:54| It was somewhat delayed the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8334)|
| 2:18:57| I believe we had our workshop run a little bit longer than we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8337)|
| 2:19:02| Three members of the school board, three members of the commission got together in the small assembly room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8342)|
| 2:19:07| and looked at opening a dialogue of how we could relay concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8347)|
| 2:19:14| and what our concerns might be back and forth or between each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8354)|
| 2:19:20| As I've said earlier, I didn't really take anything into the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8360)|
| 2:19:24| or make notes coming out of it because someone else was doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8364)|
| 2:19:31| And I'd like to ask the chair of the school board if she would come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8371)|
| 2:19:38| and she might add to some of the things that we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8378)|
| 2:19:43| I believe the only issue that I may have brought up was the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8383)|
| 2:19:47| we are soldiering along here toward receiving the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8387)|
| 2:19:53| and I maybe expressed concern that other elected bodies within Knox County might become concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8393)|
| 2:20:01| and I did not want them to feel that way about just this commission committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8401)|
| 2:20:07| and the school board committee getting together to talk about concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8407)|
| 2:20:12| I believe that may have been the only thing that I said that may have been newsworthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8412)|
| 2:20:22| Commissioner Hammond, did you want to add anything to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8422)|
| 2:20:25| And then Commissioner McKenzie was also there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8425)|
| 2:20:28| I think our next step was we identified some issues that we want to talk about between the two bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8428)|
| 2:20:32| and I think we agreed that the next time we meet that we would have up to a two-hour session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8432)|
| 2:20:36| where we could really address some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8436)|
| 2:20:39| And, you know, we talked about not only budgetary things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8439)|
| 2:20:41| but we talked about the idea of school vouchers, which is very much in the news now, charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8441)|
| 2:20:46| There were several of those kinds of issues that we felt like that would be good for us to have some discussion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8446)|
| 2:20:50| and to gain some additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8450)|
| 2:20:52| So that was really the next step, I believe, and we haven't set a date for that yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8452)|
| 2:20:56| but we're going to be meeting probably within the next 30 to 45 days, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8456)|
| 2:21:00| That would be my time frame, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8460)|
| 2:21:03| You know, I agree with what the commissioner said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8463)|
| 2:21:07| The other thing we brought up as an issue, you know, for discussion is property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8467)|
| 2:21:11| and property management of facilities, school facilities as they age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8471)|
| 2:21:16| And I think our next go-do was Karen and I were going to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8476)|
| 2:21:21| and try to formulate that next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| But I think a key point is the way you start out kind of sets the tone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8483)|
| 2:21:28| So we want to make sure that this is, you know, there's four and four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8488)|
| 2:21:33| that we're walking hand-in-hand in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8493)|
| 2:21:36| So Ms. Carson was going to try to find some outside funding to get a facilitator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8496)|
| 2:21:43| and to just help us, you know, we don't want to start electing chairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8503)|
| 2:21:47| and vice chairs and going through any of that without, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8507)|
| 2:21:50| kind of a clear pathway to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8510)|
| 2:21:52| So I think that that's one of our go-do's as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8512)|
| 2:21:57| I mean, I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8517)|
| 2:21:59| I think the one thing that we – these are the takeaways that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8519)|
| 2:22:04| Our next meeting is going to be about two hours long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8524)|
| 2:22:06| We're going to have that meeting be facilitated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8526)|
| 2:22:10| In that meeting we're going to try to establish some ground rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8530)|
| 2:22:13| for how to deal with contentious issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8533)|
| 2:22:16| We were very clear that this committee has no decision-making ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8536)|
| 2:22:21| that any decisions come back to both bodies, that there are many issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8541)|
| 2:22:27| And at the next meeting we would also, in addition to establishing ground rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8547)|
| 2:22:31| we would also identify a list of issues that we wish to address and discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8551)|
| 2:22:37| and that we also want to establish some mechanism of communication for both bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8557)|
| 2:22:43| so that if there are ideas on, you know, if a commissioner has an idea on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8563)|
| 2:22:48| that they would love to see the school board consider or try,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8568)|
| 2:22:52| we've established some mechanism for that to happen more easily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8572)|
| 2:22:55| so that it's not viewed as stepping over the line or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8575)|
| 2:23:00| But the bottom line is we just know that there are always going to be contentious issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8580)|
| 2:23:04| and if we can have a framework from which to have a civil discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8584)|
| 2:23:10| and come to an outcome that betters our county, that's what our goal, our desire is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8590)|
| 2:23:17| I thought about, as you guys were getting this report, Terry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8597)|
| 2:23:21| Coney did take minutes for us, or she will put together some minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8601)|
| 2:23:25| or some notes on the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8605)|
| 2:23:27| I am more than happy to circulate those to every commissioner as well as every board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8607)|
| 2:23:33| and that will help you keep abreast of whatever discussion is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8613)|
| 2:23:37| Other than that, that's where we ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8617)|
| 2:23:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8620)|
| 2:23:41| Thank you, Ms. Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8621)|
| 2:23:42| Any other questions or discussion related to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8622)|
| 2:23:46| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8626)|
| 2:23:47| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8627)|
| 2:23:49| Ms. Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8629)|
| 2:23:50| This is just related, but have you and Karen been able to get together on a date for a joint retreat yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8630)|
| 2:23:58| No, it seems like a number of other things have embroiled conversation lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8638)|
| 2:24:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8644)|
| 2:24:05| Are you going to be working on that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| Are we going to be working on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8647)|
| 2:24:08| You're looking at me like I should, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8648)|
| 2:24:11| You better believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8653)|
| 2:24:14| Let us get by the next flaming event, and as soon as that thing settles down, we'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8654)|
| 2:24:21| So tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8661)|
| 2:24:22| Tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8662)|
| 2:24:23| I don't think it's going to be over tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| But it is on my screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8665)|
| 2:24:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8668)|
| 2:24:29| Do you want me to helpfully remind you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8671)|
| 2:24:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8672)|
| 2:24:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8673)|
| 2:24:36| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| Next discussion item is regarding school security and the school audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8678)|
| 2:24:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8683)|
| 2:24:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8684)|
| 2:24:45| And I've added this back in for a number of reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8685)|
| 2:24:51| the main one being, and I gave Ms. Carson a courtesy call last Friday on the audio file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8691)|
| 2:25:01| that I had access to from the PBA meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8701)|
| 2:25:06| And I thought that she hadn't heard it at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8706)|
| 2:25:09| and I thought there was from that discussion that took place in the PBA meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8709)|
| 2:25:15| which was reported fairly extensively in the new Sentinel on Sunday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8715)|
| 2:25:23| that it would warrant more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8723)|
| 2:25:27| And, of course, I also felt, you know, I felt, just based on my observation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8727)|
| 2:25:33| that the school folks are in a very defensive posture, just frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8733)|
| 2:25:41| and this excessively so in my observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8741)|
| 2:25:49| I have to be very careful about my position because I have been, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8749)|
| 2:25:57| vocally oppositional to some of the efforts of the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8757)|
| 2:26:03| especially the central office management team, because of differences that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8763)|
| 2:26:09| Philosophically, I have great philosophical differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8769)|
| 2:26:13| with some of the things that are being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8773)|
| 2:26:16| And I've made, you know, I've been, that's on record and there's no, that's not news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8776)|
| 2:26:24| So when something happens, though, but my differences are on the academic side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8784)|
| 2:26:31| You know, that's where all my experience is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| And so the issue with school security is, you know, to a large part, not exclusively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8793)|
| 2:26:40| but to a large part it's a business function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8800)|
| 2:26:44| And so the items that were discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8804)|
| 2:26:47| several of the things that were discussed in the PBA board meeting were all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8807)|
| 2:26:54| and these are people that are very respected folks that are in development and construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8814)|
| 2:27:00| They're very familiar with the business side of the projects, project management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8820)|
| 2:27:05| construction projects, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| And the only way to characterize, and the only way I characterized the audio file was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8827)|
| 2:27:14| there was generally outrage at what's been taking place, how it's been taking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8834)|
| 2:27:20| how this affair has been handled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8840)|
| 2:27:23| that misleading statements are being made to the public, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8843)|
| 2:27:29| So just based on that and the coverage in the paper, I thought, well, at the very least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8849)|
| 2:27:34| we need to bring this back up and we need to discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8854)|
| 2:27:39| and see if there's further action that this body would like to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8859)|
| 2:27:44| So that being said, I've got four lights on right now, and I don't know who's first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8864)|
| 2:27:56| It was either, it was one of the mics, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8876)|
| 2:27:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8878)|
| 2:27:59| Let's go with Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8879)|
| 2:28:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8882)|
| 2:28:07| Whatever we hear right now could have a far-reaching effect as long as this lawsuit is still going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8887)|
| 2:28:17| I'm not sure that we're going to get the true story until after the suit is settled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8897)|
| 2:28:26| because either side sticks their neck out now and says something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8906)|
| 2:28:32| That's something that can be used in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8912)|
| 2:28:36| My concern is that if some of these allegations that were made in the last couple of days in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8916)|
| 2:28:45| well, let me go back a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8925)|
| 2:28:46| Last Tuesday, Dr. McIntyre made mention of the fact that last summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8926)|
| 2:28:51| the Simplex Grinnell did a survey and found all systems operating adequately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8931)|
| 2:28:57| But later on in our Tuesday afternoon discussion, we found out that there is some problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8937)|
| 2:29:03| And now, according to the paper, it seems that they were going to do a random audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8943)|
| 2:29:10| Well, it seems that the fixer-uppers are running ahead of the random auditors to make things look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8950)|
| 2:29:20| The mayor has agreed to pay for an independent study of our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8960)|
| 2:29:30| And I think that that's something that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| We need to have somebody who a reputable firm who does security work that can go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8972)|
| 2:29:39| and look at these systems in all of the schools and tell us what's going on and what's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8979)|
| 2:29:49| Thank you, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8989)|
| 2:29:50| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8992)|
| 2:29:53| Let me begin my remarks by saying that I will probably be accused of trying to overstep my bounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8993)|
| 2:29:59| and get in the school's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=8999)|
| 2:30:01| And let me just say right at the very beginning that absolutely, I'm going to put my fork in somebody's jello here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9001)|
| 2:30:10| This is in the public domain now because it is in the newspaper and accusations have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9010)|
| 2:30:14| I don't like reading things in the paper, and I like to just kind of get things out in the open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9014)|
| 2:30:18| We are an open body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9018)|
| 2:30:19| We believe in transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9019)|
| 2:30:21| So this is what I would like to do today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9021)|
| 2:30:22| Is Mr. Dale Smith here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9022)|
| 2:30:24| I'd like for Mr. Smith to come to the microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9024)|
| 2:30:28| Oh, he is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9028)|
| 2:30:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9029)|
| 2:30:41| Good afternoon, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9041)|
| 2:30:43| I'm Dale Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9043)|
| 2:30:44| I work at 400 Main Street in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9044)|
| 2:30:47| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9047)|
| 2:30:48| Again, I don't want my questions to seem overly harsh, but they are in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9048)|
| 2:30:54| We are getting phone calls about them, and these are statements that have been attributed to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9054)|
| 2:30:58| And so what I want to do is probe just a bit about these statements that have been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9058)|
| 2:31:02| and perhaps get some context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9062)|
| 2:31:03| And you're not the only person I'm going to be asking questions to, but you are the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9063)|
| 2:31:07| The newspaper is quoting you as saying that you had a meeting with Mr. McIntyre in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9067)|
| 2:31:13| and at that time you told him that his property management team was, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9073)|
| 2:31:17| rife with costly cronyism and urged him to conduct a probe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9077)|
| 2:31:22| Is that still the case today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9082)|
| 2:31:24| Would you say that the management team is rife with cronyism?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9084)|
| 2:31:30| I didn't say that to Mr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9090)|
| 2:31:35| I think that Mr. McIntyre and I in September of 2008 were discussing other issues that we had experienced in the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9095)|
| 2:31:51| Mr. Jeff Gallion was also in that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9111)|
| 2:31:57| There were issues that we discussed that I was simply bringing to Mr. McIntyre's attention of things that had occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9117)|
| 2:32:08| with his staff interacting with my staff that, let's say, did not seem to be in the school district's best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9128)|
| 2:32:19| But I never made the kind of sweeping statement that it was rife with cronyism or nepotism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9139)|
| 2:32:27| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9147)|
| 2:32:28| I mean, this is why I want to get this on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9148)|
| 2:32:30| I think even, if I'm correct, Mr. Hammond, I thought that quote was attributed to my board chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9150)|
| 2:32:39| I may be wrong, but in any event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9159)|
| 2:32:43| The other thing I should correct, by the way, given your question, is in the fall of 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9163)|
| 2:32:52| Dr. McIntyre discussed the possibility of us taking over their project management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9172)|
| 2:33:02| And one of my board members misstated that in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9182)|
| 2:33:05| I think it's property management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9185)|
| 2:33:07| And so I do want to clarify that it was not a discussion about their property management group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9187)|
| 2:33:14| which I guess I would say is somewhat managed by Mr. French.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9194)|
| 2:33:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9199)|
| 2:33:20| Again, I just want to make sure that I'm absolutely correct here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9200)|
| 2:33:23| I don't want to leave anything corny, and I'm reading directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9203)|
| 2:33:27| The PBA Smith told his board last week that PBA could manage the school system's capital projects to the tune of $150,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9207)|
| 2:33:34| compared to the $800,000 he says the school system pays annually to its property management team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9214)|
| 2:33:40| He said he warned McIntyre at a 2008 meeting when McIntyre had been on the job just five months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9220)|
| 2:33:44| that his property management team was rife with costly cronyism and urged him to conduct a probe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9224)|
| 2:33:49| I never heard another word, not any, Smith said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9229)|
| 2:33:52| The recording shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9232)|
| 2:33:54| I mean, so I guess my first question, let's go back to the rife with cronyism because this bothers me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9234)|
| 2:33:58| if indeed this is the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9238)|
| 2:34:00| If you've been misquoted, we need to make sure that we get that corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9240)|
| 2:34:04| Well, I think I was misquoted because I didn't repeat that in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9244)|
| 2:34:10| What I went through were four issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9250)|
| 2:34:13| We talked about some contractual issues, forms of contract, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9253)|
| 2:34:18| But we went through four procurement issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9258)|
| 2:34:22| And they were issues, in essence, where we were asked specifically, when I say we, I mean Mr. Gallion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9262)|
| 2:34:32| had been asked not to bid for items, but to procure them through the school system's term contractors or vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9272)|
| 2:34:42| and that we had declined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9282)|
| 2:34:45| We had said no, and we went ahead and bid them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9285)|
| 2:34:49| And, frankly, there were substantial savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9289)|
| 2:34:52| In three line items, there was over a half a million dollars of savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9292)|
| 2:34:57| That's what Dr. McIntyre and I talked about in September of 08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9297)|
| 2:35:03| But this is important because it is common for people to throw the broad sweeping kinds of statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9303)|
| 2:35:16| And I tried really hard not to do that, and I did not do that in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9316)|
| 2:35:22| I think what must have happened was the reporter trying to assemble that rather raucous meeting into an article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9322)|
| 2:35:32| kind of just summarized it on her own, I guess, is the best way to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9332)|
| 2:35:39| So, okay, and I'm good with that, and I'm glad we got that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9339)|
| 2:35:43| The second thing is the notion that your team could manage it and save $650,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9343)|
| 2:35:49| Well, the number I threw out, I apparently wasn't clear on the take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9349)|
| 2:35:54| The number I threw out was 600, not 800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9354)|
| 2:35:58| And it was, frankly, a guesstimate of what their entire project management department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9358)|
| 2:36:05| if you took all in costs, probably does run in that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9365)|
| 2:36:11| And the fee, if you will, that Mr. Gallien and I had developed over a couple of months, I guess, would have been 150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9371)|
| 2:36:23| So that, if you corrected the 800,000 to 600,000, I did say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9383)|
| 2:36:30| There was also the notion here that, again, in the meeting, and I don't want to read the whole article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9390)|
| 2:36:35| but the article seems to indicate that your board had made statements to the effect that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9395)|
| 2:36:40| what we were told by the superintendent and Ms. Carson was not correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9400)|
| 2:36:47| and that the deficiencies still existed to the extent that one of the board members are saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9407)|
| 2:36:53| that a gunman could easily walk into a school with staff viewing the images, none the wiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9413)|
| 2:36:59| And you can see why, when we read this as commissioners and as the public, we're concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9419)|
| 2:37:05| So can you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9425)|
| 2:37:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9428)|
| 2:37:10| In fact, that's basically the two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9430)|
| 2:37:14| If you distill a lot of comments and conversation into the final direction that my board asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9434)|
| 2:37:23| and that direction was to communicate publicly that they felt that the statement that all security system deficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9443)|
| 2:37:38| district-wide had been identified and remedied or corrected, that because we know for a fact that that is not true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9458)|
| 2:37:49| at Hardin Valley Academy and Powell Middle, and I double verified that the day after, I think the day after that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9469)|
| 2:38:03| that they felt like the statement was untrue, meaning at least not at those two schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9483)|
| 2:38:11| As we were informed by the law department, and the reason I communicated by the law department was the only reason I have a right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9491)|
| 2:38:23| to know any of the current status of those schools is because of the lawsuit and because there are specific steps that need to be taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9503)|
| 2:38:34| if we go do remedial work on those systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9514)|
| 2:38:38| We did exactly that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9518)|
| 2:38:40| We took those steps when we repaired the firewall penetrations that have been mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9520)|
| 2:38:46| but I was informed by the county law director's office and the gentleman in that office that represents the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9526)|
| 2:38:58| confirmed for me last Thursday morning, I guess, or Wednesday, that no other work had been done in those two schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9538)|
| 2:39:08| What do we need to do, in your opinion, to get this fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9548)|
| 2:39:12| I mean, to get to these two schools in particular, that seemed to be the issue, to make sure that the cameras are working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9552)|
| 2:39:17| that someone couldn't easily walk into a school with viewing issues, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9557)|
| 2:39:25| Well, I think that, I don't even remember who made that comment, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9565)|
| 2:39:30| but it was, I think, made after Mr. Gallion pointed out an example in the Stancil report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9570)|
| 2:39:39| and I don't know how many of you have read the Stancil report, but in the back section of that report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9579)|
| 2:39:46| there's a lot of narrative and photos in the front section, but then in the last several pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9586)|
| 2:39:54| there is what to us is a serious audit of the system that has a camera-by-camera breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9594)|
| 2:40:02| Each camera is graded from 1 to 10, 10 being the best, and there was one camera at a main entrance to that school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9602)|
| 2:40:13| that was graded a 1, meaning it's on, it shows you things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9613)|
| 2:40:19| but it is significantly deficient compared to what are industry standards for that type of camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9619)|
| 2:40:29| And so that is probably what led to that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9629)|
| 2:40:34| And my answer to the other half of that question is it may be more complicated than you guys want to go into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9634)|
| 2:40:49| I would add that there is a meeting tomorrow that the school system is convening with myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9649)|
| 2:41:00| and Mayor Burchett, apparently, and I think Commissioner Norman and the police chief and the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9660)|
| 2:41:06| and Dr. McIntyre and Ms. Carson, where I think we will be mutually discussing what those next steps should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9666)|
| 2:41:17| not only in those two schools, but system-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9677)|
| 2:41:22| Mr. Chairman, I'm over my time, but I would like to have the schools respond if that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9682)|
| 2:41:27| I feel like they deserve the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9687)|
| 2:41:29| So, Mr. Smith, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| There may be some other questions, but if Mr. McIntyre, Ms. Carson, whoever would like to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9691)|
| 2:41:37| I certainly want to give you all the opportunity to give any response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9697)|
| 2:41:46| Well, you heard Mr. Smith, and so I guess my first question would be, do you have any response to what he had to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9706)|
| 2:41:53| Yes, I do have some questions, but I want to give you an opportunity to respond first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9713)|
| 2:41:56| I'll start and I'll let Dr. McIntyre talk about what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9716)|
| 2:41:59| I'll talk about what I've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9719)|
| 2:42:01| I think I have consistently said that our cameras are functional, our alarm systems are functional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9721)|
| 2:42:09| I think it's up for grabs what function means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9729)|
| 2:42:12| I think I've been very consistent in saying that we have a far range of capability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9732)|
| 2:42:19| and quality in every one of our cameras, some raised by parents, some put in by other fundraisers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9739)|
| 2:42:25| some at the videocassette level, and that I think that post-Sandy Hook, the industry standard will be set differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9745)|
| 2:42:35| I think it's we have consistently said that at Hardin Valley, what was changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9755)|
| 2:42:43| what we did in response to the Stancil report was deal with the firewall intrusion, and that is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9763)|
| 2:42:53| I was shocked when I listened to this audio of the PBA board meeting to the point that when I heard them say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9773)|
| 2:43:00| you mean you can have a gunman in a hallway and we couldn't identify the hallway, I called Dr. McIntyre up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9780)|
| 2:43:07| I said, I want to go to Hardin Valley now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9787)|
| 2:43:09| I want to see, because I was never led to believe that to be so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9789)|
| 2:43:15| And so it got to the point where, all right, I need to see it with my own eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9795)|
| 2:43:18| I went to Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9798)|
| 2:43:20| I looked at the cameras that were rolling, and they are on all the time, and we expect them to be on all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9800)|
| 2:43:26| What's not on are motion detectors and alarm systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9806)|
| 2:43:31| I could absolutely see down hallways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9811)|
| 2:43:34| I clearly would be able to identify if there was somebody running down during school, a gunman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9814)|
| 2:43:40| I don't know that I could tell you, you know, what he looked like, but for the purpose of responding immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9820)|
| 2:43:45| I absolutely would be able to identify which hallway and where we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9825)|
| 2:43:50| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9830)|
| 2:43:51| The only people there were the security guard, me, and Dr. McIntyre, so I had Dr. McIntyre go out in the hallway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9831)|
| 2:43:57| I could see his face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9837)|
| 2:43:58| I could identify him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9838)|
| 2:44:00| I looked at the entryway, the cameras outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9840)|
| 2:44:05| I could see vehicles and identify them driving up through the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9845)|
| 2:44:08| I could see people approach the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9848)|
| 2:44:11| I think where we get stuck is grading cameras one through ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9851)|
| 2:44:15| I think industry people do that, and that's what we wish to do is find out what is the industry standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9855)|
| 2:44:22| But I only, from my perspective, could compare, you know, did this look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9862)|
| 2:44:27| I've also, in the past week, gone to his office and said, I need you to pull up ten schools randomly right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9867)|
| 2:44:34| I want to see if cameras are functioning, what they look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9874)|
| 2:44:38| The Hardin Valley cameras, I could see what I could see at other schools, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9878)|
| 2:44:42| So my reaction initially was, you know, what I heard in that board meeting, if that were true, I would be outraged also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9882)|
| 2:44:51| That was not what I found to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9891)|
| 2:44:54| He said that there's a meeting tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9894)|
| 2:44:55| Where do we go from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9895)|
| 2:44:57| What do we need to do to get this fixed and to basically say, okay, and I know there's a lawsuit, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9897)|
| 2:45:03| but I'm not worrying about a lawsuit right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9903)|
| 2:45:05| I'm worrying about public perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9905)|
| 2:45:07| So where do we go from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9907)|
| 2:45:09| Well, you know, my response, I was not aware of the PVA board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9909)|
| 2:45:12| I shouldn't have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9912)|
| 2:45:13| I mean, I'm not a part of that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9913)|
| 2:45:15| But I sure was aware after, on Friday, that there had been a lot of discussion about schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9915)|
| 2:45:23| And so I got a call from Commissioner Norman, and then I got a copy of the letter that the mayor sent to Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9923)|
| 2:45:34| I had not heard yet the audio until Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9934)|
| 2:45:38| But just based on that, that I know that there are a number of groups out there making decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9938)|
| 2:45:43| or talking about what's deficient, and they're not coming to me or the board, it was Friday that I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9943)|
| 2:45:51| we get everybody who's involved in this at the table and let's identify issues, address concerns, and come up with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9951)|
| 2:46:00| I think what we do is we stop feeding all of this through the media and closed-door meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9960)|
| 2:46:05| Let's get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9965)|
| 2:46:07| Let's identify what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9967)|
| 2:46:08| What's happening is you have two issues melding together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9968)|
| 2:46:11| One is what happened two years ago, or actually four or five years ago at Hardin Valley and their installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9971)|
| 2:46:19| That's one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9979)|
| 2:46:20| Or the issue, and out of that is the issue of Steve Griffin and contracts with PSCD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9980)|
| 2:46:27| Those are being evaluated objectively through an investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9987)|
| 2:46:31| I think that needs to sit there where it is and let's see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9991)|
| 2:46:35| And the board will do that, see what comes back to Dr. McIntyre and his actions in dealing with his personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=9995)|
| 2:46:43| The other issue is the installation at Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10003)|
| 2:46:47| That's involved in the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10007)|
| 2:46:50| But the other one is where do we need to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10010)|
| 2:46:53| And frequently now I'm hearing today's paper talks about the quality of the cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10013)|
| 2:46:58| We've continually said our cameras need to be updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10018)|
| 2:47:02| There are schools that have more than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10022)|
| 2:47:04| We understand that, and post-Sandy Hook we agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10024)|
| 2:47:10| What the standard will be is going to have to be defined and changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10030)|
| 2:47:14| So what we need to do is stop melding all three issues together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10034)|
| 2:47:19| But it is my hope that tomorrow when we have this meeting that we go there with an idea of stopping the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10039)|
| 2:47:29| I'll just be direct, covering your butts and making sure you're not fingered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10049)|
| 2:47:33| and stop the finger point and let's identify what issues exist, what can we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10053)|
| 2:47:39| or do we have to do immediately, and then how do we go about formulating a long-term plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10059)|
| 2:47:45| Dr. McIntyre, would you like to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10065)|
| 2:47:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10069)|
| 2:47:51| I guess I would like to address the question of what have we said and what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10071)|
| 2:47:57| And I think that it's, again, and I can kind of go back to what I said to you all last Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10077)|
| 2:48:04| which is what we talked about at that time was that there were deficiencies that were highlighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10084)|
| 2:48:11| by an audit in 2011 at Hardin Valley and Powell Middle School that we work with PBA to address life safety issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10091)|
| 2:48:18| which was primarily or essentially the cutouts in the firewalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10098)|
| 2:48:22| We made sure the security alarm system and video camera systems were working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10102)|
| 2:48:27| And I also, I believe, made a point of saying that I wanted to be clear that not all of the functionality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10107)|
| 2:48:34| or equipment that was promised by PSCD to PBA has been delivered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10114)|
| 2:48:40| And that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10120)|
| 2:48:42| But we know from the inspections and reviews that we have done that our security alarm systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10122)|
| 2:48:50| that our fire protection systems, that our video monitoring systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10130)|
| 2:48:54| and that our keyless entry systems at those two schools are working and that they're functioning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10134)|
| 2:49:00| that Mr. Smith doesn't like when I use the word functioning, that they're operating appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10140)|
| 2:49:05| and that they're working properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10145)|
| 2:49:07| Again, has all of the functionality and equipment that's been promised been put in place there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10147)|
| 2:49:12| No, it has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10152)|
| 2:49:13| That was why there's a lawsuit, and that's why that lawsuit is ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10153)|
| 2:49:17| But we do have functioning systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10157)|
| 2:49:20| We have systems that are working and helping us to keep our schools and our students safe at those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10160)|
| 2:49:27| The review that we did across the system is we looked at the security panels in all of our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10167)|
| 2:49:34| and Simplex Grinnell did these inspections and reviews last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10174)|
| 2:49:40| They inspected every security panel and every element, every component of our security alarm systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10180)|
| 2:49:48| On a monthly basis, we do a review of our more than 2,000 cameras that we have in the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10188)|
| 2:49:56| to see if any of those are not working, if repairs need to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10196)|
| 2:50:02| And we do that on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10202)|
| 2:50:04| We have an annual inspection of our fire protection systems by Gallaher and Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10204)|
| 2:50:10| We have a biannual inspection by the Knox County Fire Marshal in each of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10210)|
| 2:50:15| So we continually inspect and test and review these systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10215)|
| 2:50:21| And so when we have been talking about these issues publicly, I have said that based on those reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10221)|
| 2:50:33| and inspections and tests, I feel very confident that our security alarm systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10233)|
| 2:50:38| our fire protection systems, and our video camera systems are working across Knox County schools, and they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10238)|
| 2:50:46| And as I said to you last week, as of a week ago Friday when we did the last review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10246)|
| 2:50:53| the best information I have is that every single one of our 2,000 plus video cameras is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10253)|
| 2:50:59| Now again, are they at Hardin Valley Academy or Powell Middle School?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10259)|
| 2:51:03| Is it the equipment that was promised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10263)|
| 2:51:05| Is it the functionality that was promised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10265)|
| 2:51:08| Not necessarily, but the tools are in place, those tools are working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10268)|
| 2:51:13| and we're using them to keep our schools and our children safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10273)|
| 2:51:16| Mr. Chairman, I can go on with a lot, but I know other people want to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10276)|
| 2:51:19| I just want to wrap up by saying that moving forward, Mr. Smith's comments that there could be some money saved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10279)|
| 2:51:25| by his team looking over the capital projects, I think as we go into budget, that's something I'd like to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10285)|
| 2:51:31| I'm not necessarily looking at doing it today, but as we go into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10291)|
| 2:51:37| After your meeting tomorrow, I know you'll probably be sending us letters or memos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10297)|
| 2:51:42| but perhaps there could be follow-up meetings with individual commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10302)|
| 2:51:45| because obviously I think it's helpful for everybody to get to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10305)|
| 2:51:49| You all get behind closed doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10309)|
| 2:51:51| Let's kind of decide where we want to go, because we all agree the number one thing is we need to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10311)|
| 2:51:56| that whatever deficiencies are there, if we can get them corrected immediately, let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10316)|
| 2:52:01| And whatever we need to do, I think this body is ready to do whatever we need to do to take any action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10321)|
| 2:52:05| if there's any additional funding that's needed, as long as we know that it's being done properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10325)|
| 2:52:11| but also if there needs to be an audit done, as the mayor has proposed, whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10331)|
| 2:52:16| once you all get through with that meeting, let us know how we can help, and then we can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10336)|
| 2:52:21| Yes, Commissioner, I would like to address that very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130225?start=10341)|
