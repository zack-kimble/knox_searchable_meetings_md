| 0:00:00| The time is 5.04. I apologize for letting four minutes get away from us, but we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=0)|
| 0:00:07| to go ahead and begin. Today is September 18, 2008. This Nassau City Council workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7)|
| 0:00:14| is called to order. Our subject matter today is the Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=14)|
| 0:00:20| request to close a portion of 19th Street. Would you please stand so that Council Member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=20)|
| 0:00:25| P. Loke can give the invocation, and we'll ask the pledge from Council Member Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=25)|
| 0:00:30| Bow your heads, please. Our Father, we're grateful for your presence with us always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=30)|
| 0:00:38| We're grateful that you have provided for us such a magnificent fall day. It feels so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=38)|
| 0:00:44| good after the heat of the summer. And we pray that you'll be with us as we discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=44)|
| 0:00:50| these issues today. Give us open minds and clear hearts. I'm in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=50)|
| 0:00:57| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=57)|
| 0:01:05| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=65)|
| 0:01:14| Madam Recorder, would you please call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=74)|
| 0:01:20| Councilman Bailey? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=80)|
| 0:01:22| Councilman Becker? Councilman Becker is next door in the BCA meeting. There was a particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=82)|
| 0:01:29| issue that he very much wanted to be there to hear, so he will be with us as soon as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=89)|
| 0:01:34| he's free there. Vice Mayor Brand? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=94)|
| 0:01:37| Councilman Frost? Councilman Frost called me, and this is an issue that he has to recuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| himself from, but he also has a prior engagement that he has to partake in this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=102)|
| 0:01:49| I think dealing with continuing legal education seminar, so that's another reason why he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| not here, and he wanted to pass on his regrets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| Councilman Hall? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| Councilman Holquist? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| Councilman Pelo? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| Councilman Roddy? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| Councilman Woodhull? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| Thank you, and thank those members of Council for being here before we begin with our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| I'd like to see if there are any comments that any Councilmembers would like to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| particularly the Councilmember from the First District. Is there anything he'd like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| since this is an issue in his district before we begin? Anything you'd like to say, Councilmember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| Holquist, before we begin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| Well, thank you. I don't have a lot to say. I think the agenda is pretty straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| Well, I shouldn't say I don't have a lot to say, but for the moment, at least, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| have a lot to say. I think the agenda is fairly self-explanatory, and so if we get started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| on that, this is an important issue to a lot of people for a lot of reasons, and with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| I think it's appropriate just to get going, and I'll interject as I feel necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=166)|
| 0:02:53| Thank you. We'll start with the introduction and overview. I noticed that the attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=173)|
| 0:02:59| for Fort Sanders here, Mr. Seymour, I don't know if you want to introduce any of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| clients, or if you'd like for us to go ahead and get started with the President and Chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| Administrative Officer. If you would like to have some introductory remarks, sir, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| No, I think I've just passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| Okay. Thank you. Thank you, sir, if you'd give us your name and address, and you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=193)|
| 0:03:19| begin your presentation. Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| Thank you very much. My name is Keith Offshuler. I live at 307 Windham Hill Road, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| 37922, and I appreciate all of you being here today. I am the Hospital Administrator at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| Fort Sanders, and what I'd like to do today is just give a brief overview of our project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| and then turn it over to our architects and traffic engineers to maybe further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=216)|
| 0:03:42| and the general overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| As you can see, we did have some illustrations of what we were trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| I think if we can get somebody up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| Essentially, we want to try to expand a medical office building to east of Clinch Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| our current site, and put a very significant $80 million medical office building on that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=239)|
| 0:04:06| at a parking lot that we currently own, our current ED parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| And in that project, we hope to have not only medical office space and additional parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=251)|
| 0:04:17| but also an ambulatory surgery center, which we don't have on campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| and some additional outpatient services that we're still running the numbers on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| and trying to figure out exactly the extent of those in the next phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| This very significant project, I think, supports and should support the long-term goal of our hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| which is to strengthen our referral potential for our 16-county area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| We have a lot of specialists at our facility, and the more that we can build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| and attract new physicians there, the better we're going to be in terms of providing care there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| We don't believe that the expansion requires any additional property than what we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| and we project that it should have a very strong, positive impact to both the city and the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| not only in terms of jobs and tax income, but we hope to also complement the current neighborhood as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| Now, Dr. Casey, who couldn't be with us tonight, chief of staff that spoke at, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| the last city council meeting, was very direct in terms of how significant the medical staff feels that this project is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=314)|
| 0:05:21| to them going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| Again, those physicians are independent contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| They are not employed by the hospital, and it's very important that they continue to grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| and recruit partners into their firm as they retire, and also retain physicians who, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| we've got a growing medical staff shortage throughout the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| but the ability to retain who we have is also very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| And as individual practitioners, they have the ability to look at their business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| which happens to be the practice of medicine, and go wherever it is that other facilities would offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| the types of things that we're trying to implement and augment at our current facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| And so I think they're very, very strong on this project and have been for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=360)|
| 0:06:08| I think you know the Board of Zoning Appeals and the MPC has approved our plans overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| We've had at least four meetings with the neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| We've talked with members of the Cumberland Avenue Corridor, Children's Hospital, Rural Metro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| Cumberland Avenue merchants from time to time, and tried to do everything that we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| in terms of the process of communicating our plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| And we've examined the alternatives many times over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| and it concluded that the block of 19th Street between the facilities should be closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| for visitor and patient safety and specifically to facilitate, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=399)|
| 0:06:45| the access between these two facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| The closing should support the creation also of a long-needed front entrance to our facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| and ensure compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act for our ED patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| We also think that ultimately the expansion will permit us to consolidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| some of our outpatient operations into one complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| and ultimately make those services in terms of improved access and efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| better for our patients, our medical staff, and of course in the community at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| So the bottom line is we think this is going to improve care and access to our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| Now we have committed to the neighborhood that we'll continue to study the pedestrian flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| around the expanded campus and work with them to ensure that all the architectural elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| of this project would complement the neighborhood, whether it be lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| whether it be walkways, wayfinding, signage, all those things we've committed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| as well as continue to work with all the groups for future long-range planning initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| that I think everybody thinks will benefit the whole neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| You know, our hospital has been around for 89 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| and I consider it to be just a wonderful community asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| We want to continue to be here as many years as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| But I do want to make it very clear that this project we believe is critical to us moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| and continuing to be financially viable and providing very top care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| and tertiary and quaternary services that we do provide the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| So in closing, I would like to say we really need your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| We want the support of the community, and we have tried to do everything that we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| to make this project complement the whole neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| So with that being said, as an overview, I'd like to introduce, if I could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| Craig Holloway and Harold Petty with ESA Architecture to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| and talk a bit more about the structure and the design that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| Excuse me, Mr. Altshuler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| Actually, that's the vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| We've got an agenda worked out in the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| Did you get a copy of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| No, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| Do we have extra copies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| There's a copy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| I'll keep Councilman Becker's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| And let me explain to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| Mr. Danzerow has to leave early and needed to get in his presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| As for the Cumberland Avenue Merchants Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| I spoke to the council member from the first district this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| and told him that was okay not to break you guys' flow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| and then we'll let you go back so that Mr. Danzerow can be accommodated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| and then be allowed to go about his business, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| And we appreciate your understanding of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| Vice mayor, we may have to adjust that because he's in the BZA meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| He's chairing the BZA meeting next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| Mr. Danzerow is probably not going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| Then I thought that's why you were interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| Yeah, but I didn't know that that was going to drag out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| Go ahead and continue the way you were going then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| With the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Did you get a copy of the agenda now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| Go ahead and continue with your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| I thought that's why the council member from the first district was pointing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| I didn't realize Mr. Danzerow was not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| My name is Harold Petty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| I'm a principal with the firm of Earl Swenson Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| I'm an architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| And I'd like to introduce my colleague here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| Yes, my name is Craig Holloway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| I'm also a member of Earl Swenson Associates from Nashville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| Our firm has been involved in the Fort Sanders project for about two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=618)|
| 0:10:24| We began a couple of years ago and we were retained to start looking at their master plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| how we could meet some of the goals and objectives that Keith has outlined in his discussion a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| Some of the major things, aside from just the space needs, how they grow in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=635)|
| 0:10:42| how we master plan to accommodate all the future needs and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| As you well know, the piece of land east of 19th was, since the hospital is bounded by streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| this gave a great opportunity to look at future growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| and how we can meet those needs and issues as we look to tie this building together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=655)|
| 0:11:02| and meet some of the needs and goals for a main entry he talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| some of the connectivity issues, some of the patient safety, visitor safety issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| as well as how we can move patients from the outpatient center over into the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| for that continuum of care that's needed many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| As patients go into an outpatient setting, they need to move into an inpatient setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=681)|
| 0:11:27| We looked at a number of things of how to connect these buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| We started by looking at overhead connectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| And if you're familiar with this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| the hospital right now currently has fairly significant low floor-to-floor heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| compared to what we're doing in new buildings these days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| because of the more complex issues with mechanical systems and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| So we were looking at how can we connect overhead and avoid any street closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| And what we realized very quickly is that we cannot get the connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| and the patient flow and flow for visitors and physicians to connect in that manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| We even looked at other opportunities for connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| And so what we've done and what we feel is very strongly needed in this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=729)|
| 0:12:16| is by closing the 19th Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| it gives us the opportunity to connect the new building at every floor with the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| so that we can park, have patients come in and park and visitors park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| enter into a safe environment in an elevator lobby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| and connect into the hospital through an enclosed connector into the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| So this gives us the opportunity to address the safety issues with patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| And last week I was pleased to have the opportunity to meet with two architects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| that have looked at this project along with Councilman Holquist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| Mr. Frank Sparkman and Mr. Randall DeFord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| One of the issues that came up in there was addressing the pedestrian scale of this connector, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=775)|
| 0:13:04| And so one of the recommendations that was thrown out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| was looking at how right next to the hospital between our connector at the closure of 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=787)|
| 0:13:13| Was there a way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| It's a little far from you and I hope you can see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| But what we did as a result of that meeting is we heard what was said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=802)|
| 0:13:29| We heard the concerns that was expressed by Councilman Holquist as well as Mr. Sparkman and Mr. DeFord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=809)|
| 0:13:36| And so what we've done on this revised document that you will see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| that we've made an effort to show the pedestrian connection there on the closure of 19th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=821)|
| 0:13:48| with some steps that would come up from the ambulance and the walking entrance for the emergency room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=828)|
| 0:13:54| that you could come up and hit a level which would be above the connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| It would be at grade level, but it would be above the emergency level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| And then you could step back down to grade at Clinch Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| There are several issues with that we discovered as we really got into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| First of all, when patients, excuse me, visitors come up those steps, it is exactly, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| it's just right next door, not next door, but adjacent to critical care beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=855)|
| 0:14:22| There's about three to four critical care beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| There were patients lying there that you would really, just like here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| if I'm on the plaza now I'd be looking down in a patient window at a patient on a bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| And for patient privacy, all the issues now relative to patient privacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| we don't think this is good design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| We think there's other ways to address the connectivity for the pedestrians in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=879)|
| 0:14:48| The other thing that was an issue for us, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| and a concern for the pedestrians in that area is you come up 19th off of Laurel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| you would have to come through an area where ambulances are coming in on a fairly routine basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| where patients are parking and families are parking and walking across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| And since these are families under stress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| we didn't feel like that's a good mix of population of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| and there may be alternative ways to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| Now, some of this was discussed in our meeting last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| and Mr. DeFord, who is an architect there, I thought had a great idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| another opportunity to solve that may be going to the east end of our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| and creating a pedestrian sidewalk through there that we could address the connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| for public that want to move from Laurel up to Clinch Avenue on the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| So that is an opportunity, and Craig, I guess you pointed that out there, to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| But we thought that was a much better solution as opposed to trying to get the public tied up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| into the emergency area where ambulances and families are coming in under stress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=949)|
| 0:15:57| We put out to council members that you should also have in front of you a reduced copy of the map that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| I mean of the rendering we're looking at right now in case you wanted to refer to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| Everyone should have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| It's been slightly modified since then, at least the version that they're showing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| which they may or may not be proposing because I hear Mr. Petty saying he doesn't think it will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| But what you're seeing is the connector itself is slightly changed in layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| Very slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| Council Member Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| Mr. Petty, I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| This alternative design that we're being shown allows for pedestrian connectivity up 19th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=992)|
| 0:16:40| but does not propose automotive connectivity, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| So it would be asking for the closure of 19th to auto traffic but would leave it through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| so that pedestrians could get through there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| Then I'm...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| What we're saying is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| What happens to 19th in this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| It's closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| It's closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| To everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| Pedestrians, cars, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| What we're saying is there's a better answer to the pedestrian connection rather than going through the 19th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1027)|
| 0:17:15| and stepping up, as I mentioned a moment ago, through a series of steps up to the critical care level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1035)|
| 0:17:22| We're proposing that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| And Mr. DeFord, I've heard...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| You know, he thought this was a good idea, and I picked up on that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| that going to the east end of the site was a much better response to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| And we don't have as much topo to deal with there, except on the steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| There will be some steps that would go down to Laurel Avenue from that upper level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| But what it does, it just separates it much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| I guess two things quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| I apologize for being late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| I was at BZA, and they're postponing, so it's a waste of time anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| I wanted to just be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| This is sort of a follow-up on Ms. Rowdy's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| The map we've got in front of us doesn't show either that or the proposal, the other alternative for the pedestrian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1081)|
| 0:18:09| But as I understand it, the pedestrian walkway would be next to the building on the east side, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| So do you have a map that shows that at all, even?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| We have it on that right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| Is it on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| I think it can show it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| This sidewalk right here would just extend all the way down to the cliff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| And then you'd have a series of steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| And is the grade bad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| Because I know you're going down to get the cars in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| Is that a significant grade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| No, the cars are not entering the garage here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| So you've changed it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| There's not an entrance on this side then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| It's kind of hard for the rest of us to hear that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| And we like it that way, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| Well, I heard actually, and again, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| What we'd like to do is there's going to be a driveway going in on this side, if you can see, on the east side of the office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1141)|
| 0:19:10| That's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| And you'd put the walkway there on the east side of the ‑‑ okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| If you could, so that other council members could get the full value of that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| if one of you would once again point out so everybody can see what you and Councilman Becker were just talking about there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| point out to where you were talking about the sidewalk would be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1173)|
| 0:19:55| Can you turn around and show the audience just the point where it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| Susan has indicated that we can't pick that conversation up, the comments you've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| So maybe if we used a microphone it would be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1207)|
| 0:20:15| Let me say again that on the east side of the building, one, there's no parking that's going to enter the garage from the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1215)|
| 0:20:23| It's all going to be on the west side and on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| And so we would propose a sidewalk that would extend from Clinch all the way back along the face of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| until you get back to where the apartment building is that faces Laurel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| And then you would step down a series of steps that would get you actually to the Laurel Street elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1236)|
| 0:20:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1243)|
| 0:20:51| We're talking a sidewalk that would extend from Clinch all the way down the east side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| a series of steps then to make the transition down to the Laurel Street elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1256)|
| 0:21:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| You can go ahead and continue with your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Well, I think one of the comments I'd like to make, in our opinion, we have made a fairly significant change in this design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1276)|
| 0:21:24| from those preliminary drawings that we reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| Quite a bit more attention, as I say, has been given to the connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| We looked at what happens if we just tunnel under the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| and what happens if the top of our tunnel actually comes out of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| And it's about seven or eight feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| The top of the tunnel would actually be sticking out of the street by about seven to eight feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1303)|
| 0:21:49| So it really doesn't work to leave 19th open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| We have to close 19th, in my opinion, in order to meet the goals that have been set out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| and charged with this facility from a master planning perspective to get the connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| the patient flow that we've discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| Now, as you come in at this main level up here, Craig pointed that out, at that main level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| this will serve somewhat as a new entry to the hospital, too, because right now, as you well know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| the entrance to the hospital is down here, which is on Clinch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| It's a very understated entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| It is very difficult to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| It's very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| It doesn't really meet ADA requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| So part of what we're trying to do in all this is address ADA, access, patient safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| and how can we get people in the building in a safe way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| And if you're coming in as a visitor, how do you get back into this building over an existing hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| to go visit family members or whomever is in the hospital there in a patient room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| And so the only way we can do that is to be able to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| and you would go down a set of elevators here at this new level all the way down to what is the ground floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| which is currently the level of the main lobby as the hospital is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| And so it gives us safe access down there and connectivity for that wayfinding that we feel is very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1384)|
| 0:23:11| of getting from this building back over to here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| And it would bring you back to this set of elevators right in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| that takes you up into the patient tower to visit patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| We also would give us an access level at the ED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| Do we have that floor as well, Craig?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1407)|
| 0:23:40| This is at what you're seeing here is at the emergency level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| And as you can see, we have a set of elevators in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| and there's a stairway that you can come down to this first level of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| And from here you can park in the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| You can come up off of Laurel, come into the garage and park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| And you can come through here into a vestibule entry, a safe environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| and walk through and connect in to the emergency room level here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| Now, if you're another option to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| if you're a patient that's coming in with a family member and you're going to walk in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| one of the options is to just park and you can come straight through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| You can just walk straight across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| But to create a safe environment, particularly at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| with families bringing maybe small children who are sick or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| it gives you a safe way in and get inside the building very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| So we feel like this connection here is very level, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| And the top of this connector, as I mentioned, as you see here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| that's the part that I said would be protruding above the street level about six to seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| maybe about seven to eight feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| Yeah, let me ask a couple of quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| The map you've got, this is the emergency level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| So this is the level that's the first floor of the current building, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| And then the level here is this is the level that would be the street level on the new building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1498)|
| 0:25:09| and the second floor, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| And then the third one you've given us, this would be below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| This would be the first level of the basement in the current building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| and the second level of the basement in the new building, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| And is there still a connection here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| And we have a new board on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| Well, now let me ask you, is the connection a three-story connection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| So they're going to be three stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| You can walk across on any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| And this is the ground floor of the hospital, which is, again, as I said a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| is the main entry off of Clinch currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| Let me correct one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| It's three stories, but only two of those connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| The top one, when you come from, if you're entering in the new entrance to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| Speak into the microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| If you're coming into the main entrance of the new building and want to get to the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| you can't just walk straight across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| You walk over to the connector lobby, and you have to go down either one level or two levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| As either a public person, if you're coming in to visit someone in the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| then you would make that transition, but you'd have to go down a level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| So we're only connected at the hospital on the bottom two levels of that three-story connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| Council Member Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| Council, what I've done to clarify things is on the copies that you have in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| where it says first floor plan on the existing building, that's the critical care level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| Where it says upper garage level on the existing building, that's the emergency level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1608)|
| 0:26:56| Where it says lower garage level on the existing building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| it shows the entry level or main level of the existing hospital building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| where patients now enter and where the lobby is, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| Administrative offices, other space, not much of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| some of it non-critical or non-important in terms of medical space, what they call soft space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1633)|
| 0:27:21| Mr. Petty, when we met on Thursday, of course, as you say, you've changed the drawings some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| and the drawings, of course, indicate, well, some of them indicate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| one of them indicated the walk, the steps, but the rest of them don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| But you've changed what you showed us from a two-level connector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| that would connect primarily on the lower level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| But what you said was the second level up, which would connect to the emergency level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1666)|
| 0:27:54| would be at that point you were saying that would be staff only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| That's what you said last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| So you're changing, you're working through your design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| I understand you're trying to refine your design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| and coming up with something different than what you showed us before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| or talked to us about before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| And now you're adding, at that point you just talked about two levels of connector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| with the upper level being limited to staff, like I say, and connecting to the emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| And you said the public going to the emergency would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| as counsel has a drawing on the one labeled upper garage level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| shows the walkway coming out of the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| And you said you'd put a canopy over that attached to the connector structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| to shelter visitors that were going to the emergency space or emergency lobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1719)|
| 0:28:49| Now you're saying you're going to add more height to the connector structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| but still keep it at two access levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| And if I understand correctly, now you're proposing for the second access level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| to also be open to the general public or the visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| I think what I said last week was that at that there is a back corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| a peripheral corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| Let's show that, Craig, where that wraps around behind the emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| We were talking about this corridor right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| What I said was that this entry right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| this entry point kind of takes you back into a clinical area of the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| In other words, basically here you've got surgery, you've got emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| you've got imaging and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| It's primarily a clinical level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| What I had said was that this was primarily going to be probably a staff corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1776)|
| 0:29:43| because we don't really know how the patient flow is going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| But the idea here was that the patients who park here can come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| and have an option to come in through here and enter the waiting room for the ED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| We can have controlled access back into that corridor there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| particularly in the late hours of the night when we don't want public in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| So that was the intent of the statement on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| Well, maybe I misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| I thought I understood you to say that that second level within the connector would be limited to staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1808)|
| 0:30:16| and that the emergency access from the garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| that was the reason for the outside walkway and the canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| So maybe I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| Well, there is a walkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| One of the options that we've done here is for people who sometimes when a young mother comes in with her child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| and she's in a hurry, they're going to either pull up in the front door and stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| or they're going to park somewhere very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| When a child's running a 104-degree fever, they're going to take the quickest way in they could get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| So what we try to do here is provide a way under cover so that under those stressful conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| that someone could park and without going inside this vestibule entry here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| and coming in this way could just make a dart to the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| And that happens a lot in emergency rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| And we've been involved in a lot of complex hospitals and urban areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| and I know that emergency rooms, particularly in urban areas like this, they're very active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| And so we're trying to look at all the options to facilitate people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| to get in those in a very quick and safe manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| A couple more quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| One of these levels of the connector sticks seven feet up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| Which one is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Is it the one at the upper garage level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| That's seven feet above grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| So what you've got is the people that are coming in your grand entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| and this is called the first floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| This is not connecting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| This is, while there's a structure here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| the people that come in here are going to have to go down to get to your level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| And now this is what Mr. Holquist was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| The one that's sticking up, this is still not your preferred connector, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| Because you want people to actually go back down to this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| So the two levels that are actually coming above grade level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1917)|
| 0:32:05| you really don't want to use for connectors, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| We can't connect at the main level of our new building, which is at elevation 969,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1928)|
| 0:32:14| and the elevation of the second floor, which critical care is located, is about 954.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| But what you've got is you've got three levels on the new building, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| And you're coming in at the top level is your new entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| But where you're wanting everybody to go is down at the third level on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| Public, from a public perspective, primarily you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| we want that public traffic to come in the main entrance of the new building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| and transition over to this three-story connector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| which when you get to that decision-making point, you have to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| You can't continue horizontally over to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| You go down two floors and then transition over into what will be some newly developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| newly developed corridor that will lead you over to what is now the public lobby and main elevator course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1974)|
| 0:33:00| So I don't want to be too aggressive on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| but it sounds like you don't need the top two floors of the connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| Well, again, the top level is part of the connector that leads you to the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| So you've got to be able to get those people down, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| So you've got to make that horizontal transition in the new building to a point and then go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| That doesn't have to be in our road, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| I mean, that's an up-and-down movement that you could do anyplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| It's better if it's in the road, but it doesn't have to be, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| Well, the connector, the elevators don't work inside our building with the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| and just the way the connectivity and everything works, it just doesn't work to move those elevators around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2019)|
| 0:33:47| I mean, we've got to get to that set of elevators to get down to the lower level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| It doesn't work to move the elevators because?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| Well, what I'm saying inside the building, what we'd have to do in that case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| which doesn't work with the design, is to pull those elevators inside, and that doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| It doesn't work why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| Just for the connectivity, and it's taking space out of our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| And also lose some parking out of that corner of the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| And we're going to lose parking out of that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| But even with that said, if you could move those elevators, even if you could, which we can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2058)|
| 0:34:26| we've still got to get down to that ED level, the emergency room level, and get across,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| which means the top of that tunnel then, if you will, is sticking out of 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| But you want people to go to the bottom level, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| The connection on your first floor would be under your lower garage level is your main floor of the current building, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2079)|
| 0:34:48| Yes, but that's not the ED level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| See, there are two types of patients or the public that we're trying to maneuver from one building to the next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2090)|
| 0:34:57| and that is the public, which would go down to that lower level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| and the ED traffic that could go through as well as other staff traffic like physicians that may be parking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2100)|
| 0:35:07| We've got to get the ED walk-in traffic over into the ED entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| And they have two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| They can go through that connector as well as the breezeway that's shown there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| Excuse me, what's ED?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| I'm sorry, the emergency department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| Department. Ah, I got the E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| On TV, it's the ER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| You were thinking ER, weren't you, Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| Council Member Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| We've been watching too much TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| No, I think you answered my question, but you were talking about going down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| and it sounded as if it were stepping down, but you are talking about elevators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| We've got elevators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| Because I couldn't see how that was going to meet the ADA codes and so on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| and how that was going to facilitate people who had difficulty negotiating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| So this is elevators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| If you know the parking areas that are out there now on both sides of Clinch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| a lot of people park there, and then they walk down Clinch, and it's a very steep slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| and it even gets steeper as you enter the main entrance of the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| Drove that again this week just to make myself very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| And it happens routinely in hospitals where patients come in the wrong door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| and wayfinding is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| So what this design does, if a patient enters at that main new level that we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| it's very important if they're going to the emergency room level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| that they can get on that elevator, go down, and traverse right straight into the emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| It also gives us access for patients that are coming in, either walking in or in an ambulance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| that they can be transferred very easily into the surgery or into the radiology department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2197)|
| 0:36:44| And patients, again, who are having outpatient services done up in the outpatient building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| it's not uncommon sometimes that physicians say you need to go to the hospital for more testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| for more complex testing than we can do in an outpatient setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| So it just ties that continuum of care together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| Another observation that I made just on that little drive-through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| to be sure I was really comfortable with elevations and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| was that ambulance coming in, many people walking across from the parking area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2229)|
| 0:37:17| just concerned about how everyone's safe and how everyone can make it from one area to the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2237)|
| 0:37:26| which they're having to do now because of the parking location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| So that was one concern I had personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| I was going to bring up, there's a third party here that we haven't talked about yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| and that is the ambulance traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| Right now they come in and they, I guess, pretty much block the street as they back up into the ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| That was what I observed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| And so by doing this, by closing 19th, we give a safe haven not only for the walk-in patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| who are under usually a lot of stress coming into the ED,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| but the ambulance traffic as well as not fighting public traffic that's coming down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| We think that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| Council Member Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| Vice Mayor, I know we're going to have more questions for Mr. Petty and Mr. Holloway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2284)|
| 0:38:11| but we have a couple of others on the agenda for this same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| and I know one of them has to leave about 6 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| so if it's okay with everybody if we could just let them say their piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| I think it may be brief, and then come back to Mr. Petty and Mr. Holloway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| I sense that you guys are going to be with us until the end, so if you don't mind, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| Or do either one of you gentlemen have to leave early?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| Who would you like to have come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| I think Mr. DeFord is on next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| Mr. DeFord, if you could, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2323)|
| 0:38:51| Randall DeFord, 1511 Laurel Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| I actually would like to read a few comments from Frank Sparkman, who Mr. Petty mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2335)|
| 0:39:02| and then introduce to you another architect, David Cockrell, who has to leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| and then I'll be willing to come back and let whoever was on the spot on the agenda speak before I finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2346)|
| 0:39:15| Many of you know Frank Sparkman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| He's an architect who's practiced, I think, 35 years in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| and he graciously met with Mr. Petty and myself and hospital representatives last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| And he is not able to be here, but he sent me these comments that I'll just read to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| It doesn't appear to be necessary to close the street to be able to connect the new structure to the existing structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| It should work just as well if the street is appropriately traffic-calmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| Closing the street will probably create more problems than if the street is left open and calmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2385)|
| 0:39:51| The fact that Children's Hospital has more ambulance bays on 20th Street creates more of a grade problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2391)|
| 0:39:58| and still works well is evidence that it's unnecessary from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| Those are the comments of Frank Sparkman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| Now I would like to take a break in my comments and introduce David Cockrell, who's an architect here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2406)|
| 0:40:23| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| My name is David Cockrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| I'm an architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| Our practice resides at 220 West Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| This is my partner in the firm, Margaret Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| We were asked just to take sort of an overview of this concept and not being involved really in this whatsoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2434)|
| 0:40:42| but to comment in a general overview fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| And really I have two general comments I want to share with you all for your consideration as you look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2446)|
| 0:40:52| First of all, looking from a global standpoint, I am an architect of 28 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2452)|
| 0:40:58| I've done medical master planning as well as urban planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| And when I look at the street grid and sort of urban fabric of the Fort Sanders neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2463)|
| 0:41:10| I think to close 19th would have a very negative impact on the community and on the urban fabric of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2470)|
| 0:41:20| It's one of only, I think, two streets that are terminated by a signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| It serves as a connection between a lot of the residential properties and the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| I think this will just be compounded and become much more pertinent with the Cumberland Avenue corridor redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2492)|
| 0:41:39| But I think whereas the designers have presented an argument for connectivity of the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2499)|
| 0:41:48| I think conversely this would result in the disconnectivity of the community in the Fort Sanders area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2508)|
| 0:41:55| The second point that I would make, and albeit without detail and a lot of exposure to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2515)|
| 0:42:01| but in a long-range strategic plan for a medical facility that is ongoing, I would think at least a 50-year viewpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2521)|
| 0:42:11| I would want to question a long-range master plan that's hinged on closing a city street because of what it does to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2531)|
| 0:42:22| And I think the opportunity of introducing a brand new facility opens up just a whole plethora of solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2542)|
| 0:42:33| that would not necessitate the closure of 19th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| And I would like to ask Margaret to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| She's a frequent commuter, I guess, through that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| That's right. I used to be an adjacent property owner as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| I have just traveled that path for many years, traveling from kind of a back area of downtown through the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2569)|
| 0:42:57| through the neighborhood, over to the other side of Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| and just know firsthand that that's such a vital artery, north-south artery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| and would probably just hope that detailed traffic studies have been looked at for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2587)|
| 0:43:14| because I can just imagine, imagining myself trying to find another route through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2594)|
| 0:43:20| would have put a lot of stress and strain on some other intersections in that nearby community just a block or two away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2600)|
| 0:43:28| that right now are the three-way stop there on 17th and Clinch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| and some of the other communicating intersections around that area that are somewhat questionable right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2613)|
| 0:43:42| And I've witnessed wrecks at those locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| So I just, from a community standpoint, would be concerned about closing off blocks within that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2625)|
| 0:43:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| Council Member Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| Yes. Could you return, excuse me, David Cockrell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2637)|
| 0:44:07| You mentioned that there would be a negative impact to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| What is going to be the future negative impact to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| besides the obvious one that there's no longer access, there's no connectivity there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| In your eyes, what does the future hold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| Well, I think wayfinding and just looking from imagining your vantage point as a steward of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2667)|
| 0:44:34| and thinking long-term is multi-generational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| That street grid is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| I don't know what emergency services has looked at in regards to access, firefighting, police protection, those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2680)|
| 0:44:47| But one of the principles of urban planning is that you offer multiple routes to get to the same destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| And I just know what the population, residential population, a lot of them are students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2693)|
| 0:44:59| They're trying to get to campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| It's a historic neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| It's based on scale and transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| That kind of connectivity, that makes sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| But that street is pretty congested with emergency vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| And I've actually ridden my bike around there and tend to avoid that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| And I would, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| And I think that might speak to a bigger issue of how is that ambulance entrance being handled now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2719)|
| 0:45:28| I question, not second-guessing, but if I were attacking a problem, I would begin to ask some initial questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2728)|
| 0:45:36| What is the life cycle left on that existing building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| How many generations is it left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| Is the emergency room in the right place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| Should that ambulance entrance even be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| Is there an opportunity in the new design to self-contain that ambulance entrance, maybe under the new building in structured parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2747)|
| 0:45:56| There's a myriad of solutions that I would want to explore with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| And, like I say, I've done medical master planning in urban context before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| So I think my first reaction was the ambulance entrance and the conflicts that you have between pedestrians, emergency vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2766)|
| 0:46:18| general day-to-day traffic is the big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| And I think closing the street just yields to that deficiency now and exacerbates the circulation issues in the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2782)|
| 0:46:32| I think you're setting a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| I think the neighborhood could actually die from a thousand small wounds by closing this street and that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2795)|
| 0:46:43| And then you have mega blocks with no cross circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| You have to think about other features like light and air, sort of some more global issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2807)|
| 0:46:54| Are there any other kind of secondary impacts that you would think, like five years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| if we did this we're going to discover something else for lack of access or connectivity along this street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2819)|
| 0:47:08| some other problem is going to occur somewhere else in your experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| I think they all are one dependent on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| I can't really foresee or predict what that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| other than the immediate disruption of the pedestrian vehicular circulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| and the sort of protection of an existing situation that's less than desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2844)|
| 0:47:33| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| Council Member Holquist, did you say there was another individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| Mr. DeFord, did you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| I think Mr. DeFord was going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| That's what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| Randall DeFord again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| In general, my neighbors and I agree with the concerns that you've heard voiced tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2873)|
| 0:48:01| and in letters in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| But more importantly, we ask that you end the piecemeal planning of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2883)|
| 0:48:09| It's more important that we partner all the stakeholder groups in this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2889)|
| 0:48:14| to improve Fort Sanders for the benefit of all and the greater community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2894)|
| 0:48:20| City Council has invested $13 million in the redevelopment of Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2900)|
| 0:48:27| and you voted to include the industrial area to our north in a redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2907)|
| 0:48:34| We and all stakeholders want a safe and vibrant neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| So, please, dust off the 2,000-neighborhood plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2919)|
| 0:48:46| Tweak it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| Adjust it as is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| Engage MPC to do a small area plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| Our neighbors are trying to do their part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| We have formed our own neighborhood-led community development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2935)|
| 0:49:02| We are convinced that this corporation can begin to plant owner-occupants in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2942)|
| 0:49:10| turn the neighborhood around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| And we have asked Covenant to partner with us by donating some property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| the property known as the Harb Property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| and an unimproved lot across the street from this property, as well as cash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| to begin a program that plants owner-occupants in single-family residents in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2962)|
| 0:49:31| And we're convinced that by growing this population of owner-occupants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| we can stabilize the neighborhood, we can revitalize the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| we can create the safe, vibrant neighborhood that not only those neighbors you know now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2980)|
| 0:49:48| but future doctors, Covenant and Children's Hospital staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| as well as UT staff will feel comfortable and safe living and walking to work in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=2994)|
| 0:50:01| Please help us and encourage this partnership and join in this partnership yourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3001)|
| 0:50:08| to create a Fort Sanders that is a neighborhood asset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| that is a community asset, and that we can all be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| Council Member Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| Mr. Petty or Mr. Holloway, they're one or both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| I'd just like to follow up now and ask some questions based on your previous comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3026)|
| 0:50:33| and our previous conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| Mr. Petty, I understood you to say that there is no way that the elevators that are dedicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3036)|
| 0:50:46| to accessing this connector to the existing building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| that those elevators cannot be placed in the new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| Did I understand you to say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| What I said was that if we moved them inside the new building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| we still have to connect at the ED level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| which means we still have to traverse and connect at the emergency room level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| I thought I heard you say something else, but thank you for clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| So the stair tower and the new elevators that would access that connector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3071)|
| 0:51:18| could be put inside the new building, perhaps in this undesignated area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3078)|
| 0:51:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| Even if they could be put inside the building, we have to have an exit stair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| because that end of the building has to have a fire exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| But like most buildings, the exit stairs can go inside the building envelope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| In this case, even if we could move them inside in the design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| it does not, again, preclude having to connect and get through at the emergency room level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| Now let's go to that, the connection to the emergency room level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| I understand that you'd like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| I also understand that the original plan, as best I could tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| and based on our previous conversation, as I said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| did not indicate primary public access from the building or garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| to the emergency department or emergency room itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3129)|
| 0:52:16| My understanding, again, from our previous conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| is the single most important connection is that lower level connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| because this building is supposed to contain the new main entrance to the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3146)|
| 0:52:33| or at least that's what the hope of Covenant Health is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| to be able to designate that, the new main entrance to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| And I believe I heard you say a week ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| probably eventually admissions also in the new building, perhaps in the undesignated area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3166)|
| 0:52:54| So that's critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| And, of course, that on the drawing supplied would be indicated at the lower garage level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3175)|
| 0:53:02| That gets people visiting this new medical office building that contains physicians' offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3182)|
| 0:53:11| as is indicated on the plan, at least for the first floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| And, again, that's what you said, the other floors will probably be physicians' offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| and perhaps outpatient surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| And did you say, I don't know if you said anything about diagnostics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| I realize that diagnostics require a CON so that you don't necessarily know that for certain yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3208)|
| 0:53:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| So when people come into this new building, not the garage, that's a different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| They may come into the garage and they go to the emergency room and then park and drop off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| go into the garage, or go into the garage, get out of their car and go into the emergency room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| depending on how concerned, how panicked, whatever they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| But the people that come into the doctors' offices, the physicians' offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3236)|
| 0:54:01| I understand you earlier to say that those people might,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| that the physicians might determine that they should be referred to the ED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| Or clinical services that's located on the emergency room level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| Or clinical services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| There's other clinical services there other than the emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| There's diagnostics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| There's surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| Imaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| Yeah, imaging department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| And what you're saying is you'd like to see the street closed so that two levels of connection can happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3267)|
| 0:54:34| so that they can access that floor directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| And we know that from time to time that access may be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| Typically, if they're going to a doctor's office, they've not had a heart attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3282)|
| 0:54:49| They've not had a stroke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| They've not clearly self-identified as someone who needs emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3291)|
| 0:54:58| They may need clinical services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| Everybody knows that that may happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| But those, the most critical, most time-sensitive emergency candidates for emergency care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3302)|
| 0:55:13| would typically go directly to the emergency room entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| Would you say that's probably a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| I think given the fact that most individuals know where the emergency room is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| I would think they would report to that if they have need of emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| So if someone needs clinical services or they're visiting a physician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| and the physician says, I'm really concerned about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| Let's get you into that hospital right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| How much time is it going to cost them to go down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| Regardless, they've got to make a transition from one elevator to another in the new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3350)|
| 0:55:57| How much time is it going to cost them to get on the elevator, go to the lower level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| go into the existing building and come up one level to get to ER or to clinical services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| How critical is that going to be for someone visiting doctor's offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| or having outpatient surgery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| And how often is that going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| And what's the historic basis for saying that that is that important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| that we need to close the street by creating that second level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| Well, I think the critical nature of that time that you might ask about there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| is more of a physician call, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| Because the physician is going to know what the needs of that patient are and they vary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| depending on whatever the needs may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| and the importance that the physician sees that they need to be transferred from wherever they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| in the office building to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| So that's a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| But you design your firm, if I understand what you said a week ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| the bulk of your business is hospitals and medical facilities, physician's offices, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| So you're pretty close to being an expert on these things, I would say, between the two of you, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3422)|
| 0:57:09| I don't want you to brag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| I don't want you to feel like you're bragging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| But wouldn't you consider yourself somewhat of an expert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| Well, I'll put it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| Again, just about 80% to 90% of the total volume our firm does annually is health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3436)|
| 0:57:23| I head up the health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| I'm the principal in charge of the health care department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| Craig is a PA that's been in our firm for 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| In the last 30 years, all my time has been spent in health care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| and it's been done all across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| We've worked in big urban areas, Chicago, San Diego, Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3457)|
| 0:57:43| I could go on and on in major cities where these complex issues that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| and as major medical centers look to grow and position themselves for the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| to meet not only the needs of the patients but also for the physicians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| and how you tie that together is something that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| For this facility, that's what we've tried to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| And believe me, I'm promoting your credentials, so I'm not questioning them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| I think you're very credentialed in that we all should recognize that, and I think we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3488)|
| 0:58:15| I guess my question is, as you have designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| or been involved in the design of many, many facilities all over the country, medical facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3498)|
| 0:58:24| how often do you find the opportunity and how often do you say it's of utmost importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3504)|
| 0:58:31| when you're doing design of physician's office buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| or a combination of physician's office building and outpatient services such as outpatient surgery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3515)|
| 0:58:42| how often do you say this has got to be next to the ER and have a direct connection to the ER?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3522)|
| 0:58:48| Because I'm not nearly as familiar with medical facilities as you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| but I'm thinking about the ones that I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| but I just can't think of very many that have organized themselves that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3536)|
| 0:59:03| where outpatient services and physician's offices are intentionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3543)|
| 0:59:09| that they make that a top priority of locating them next to the ER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| I hope you understand my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| In many facilities, I was just thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| I can think of a number of facilities where physician's offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| and ambulatory services are located with a close relationship to the emergency room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3564)|
| 0:59:29| and diagnostic services in the main hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| Certainly you would want diagnostic services in the main hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| Well, that's on that ED level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| We keep using the term ED, the emergency room level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| That connectivity there, what we're accustomed to seeing is the diagnostics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| and imaging adjacent to the emergency department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| Because patients that come in, particularly any victim of a wreck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3588)|
| 0:59:53| or whatever is going to have to be x-rayed or MRs or CTs or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3593)|
| 0:59:59| And any patients that come in for less technical services like chest x-rays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3599)|
| 1:00:07| just diagnostics or whatever, less intensive diagnostics are going to be referred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| In some cases, they're referred from the physician's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| because the doctors don't have that equipment in their office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| And they say you need to go to the hospital to get a procedure done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| And it's great to have a direct connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| Of course, as you pointed out, in this case, the diagnostic services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| and those services are adjacent to the ER in the existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| So that's the issue is the connectivity to the doctor's offices and not between those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| I think they're going to really like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| Oh, I'm sure they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| But I guess the real question here, and to me the real rub,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| is whether or not an elevator trip back up one floor in the existing hospital building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3643)|
| 1:00:52| considering what those referrals are going to be like, how frequent they're going to be, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3652)|
| 1:00:59| how critical it is to have a situation where you close a city street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| in order to avoid a one-floor elevator trip from the connector up to the ER and diagnostic level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3664)|
| 1:01:14| Well, I guess my response to that would be if I were a chest pain patient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| and I came to the front door, if you will, and that can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3679)|
| 1:01:24| The front door of the hospital, the new front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| The new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| And I found or my family found that I've got to go down and then back up to get to the emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3690)|
| 1:01:37| It could be a very critical nature with chest pains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| So it could be, and I can see if 19th Street were closed and you didn't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3701)|
| 1:01:50| they were in a situation, wayfinding whether it's good or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| if 19th Street is closed and they're trying to figure it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| and they pull up and they're pulling up to the front of the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| and they don't see anything that says emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| or they see a sign that points to emergency way down the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| they might get confused and go in the main entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| But if they're pulling up into this entrance way and right in front of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| they see wayfinding that says emergency right around the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| I would hope that most people would pick up on that strong visual message or clue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3739)|
| 1:02:27| And make that decision to drive around the corner and drop at the emergency entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3747)|
| 1:02:34| My point is that we're talking about hypotheticals, I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| but I'm just really concerned that we're closing a very important city street in order to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3759)|
| 1:02:49| and as a result, really damaging the transportation grid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3769)|
| 1:02:57| only to address very occasional and probably hypothetical situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3777)|
| 1:03:05| whereas many, many hospitals have much greater separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| from physician's offices and outpatient surgery facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3790)|
| 1:03:16| I had a minor outpatient procedure done less than two years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3796)|
| 1:03:22| and it was in an outpatient surgery facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| It was more or less on the campus of the hospital here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| It didn't connect directly to the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| and it was a good distance from the ER entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| That's not perfect, I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| but if I were to ask them statistically or historically, anecdotally, statistically, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3821)|
| 1:03:51| what the problems have been in not having that direct adjacency and direct connection to the ER,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| I wonder what the answer would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| And I may just go to that hospital and ask them that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| but I really struggle with the rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| Now we're told we've got to close the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| There's no other way that this can work effectively, and I just can't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| I can see only incremental improvements in convenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3857)|
| 1:04:24| and hypothetically, perhaps on a rare occasion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| somebody making a difference in terms of response time or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| I would think that almost all of that can be addressed otherwise, design-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3873)|
| 1:04:41| Let me just address kind of the hypothetical side of what we've been talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| versus the real-life side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| And although it may be true that it may be a patient that's already in this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| that needs to get to the ED,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| the primary reason that contributes to the street closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| are those patients that are coming in specifically to the ED| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| that are going to walk across that street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| that right now they have been parking in a lot, a surface lot across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| and maneuvering across traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| So the real-life patients and the large volume of patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| that are going to get the benefit from having 19th closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| are those ED patients who can now come up into a parking deck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| park their car, and walk across this connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| If that connection's not there and they have to go park in the garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| go down a level, over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| then we have to put another elevator to get them right back up again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| they're losing valuable time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| which could be valuable from a life-saving perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3939)|
| 1:05:40| A direct connection from that volume is much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| There's a bigger volume there than a hypothetical volume of patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| coming from physicians' offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| I know that other council members want to ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| and so I'd like to come back to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| but I've talked too long and I want to defer to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| Thank you, Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3957)|
| 1:05:58| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| Actually, just a quick follow-up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| because I tend to agree that we've got the ED level is the one that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| to close the street for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| and the public level is going to be under the street anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| And I guess I have some concern that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| it's sort of what it sounds like you're saying for the patients that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| coming in and parking in the parking garage is that there's no way for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3976)|
| 1:06:22| to get across the street except in this new area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3982)|
| 1:06:28| That street, most of Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| the busy streets are very dangerous to cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| This street is not a dangerous one to cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| I walk there a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| I would say if somebody pulls into that parking garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| and needs to get to the emergency room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| they are not going to walk up to the crossway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| walk across it and walk back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| They're just going to go right across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| I also think, frankly, if somebody comes in the front door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4011)|
| 1:06:54| I think a good way finding would not be to tell them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4014)|
| 1:06:58| go down this hall, get this elevator, go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| What it would be is go out the door, go straight down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| and you'll see the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| I mean, it feels like six of one, half dozen of the other from the main entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| So, again, if the connection, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| and maybe I'm lecturing rather than asking a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| I think I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| It feels to me like if the connection that we have to close the street for isn't there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| people can cross the street there anyway, and it's going to work just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4040)|
| 1:07:25| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| I guess you can answer that question, and we'll call it a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| Well, I think from two perspectives, from an ADA perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| I think we're doing an injustice for patients that are coming in with wheelchairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| whether it's you bringing your mother in and you're taking a wheelchair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| and you're having to go across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| Even if we pave a sidewalk across that street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| we're just dealing with too many things that are now adding more stress level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| to what is already a very stressful situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| and I just don't think that's what we want to do in these emergent times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| And I would ask, too, that you, again, keep in mind the fact that this main level of our new building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| which is possibly going to have some ambulatory services in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| and the connection of getting those patients down in a very easy way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| So it's more than just one issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| It's several complex issues that we have to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| So what we're doing is looking at this project as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| and how do we keep Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center viable to meet its goals and objectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| and tie this building together for the physicians, patients, visitors and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4105)|
| 1:08:31| Council Member Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| Mr. Petty, Children's Hospital, which is just around the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| has successfully utilized a bridge structure between their physician's office building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| and their main hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| And given the elevations here, did you consider a bridge from the new building to the old building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| and then I guess one would go down then to get down an elevator if you wanted to be on the main,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4130)|
| 1:08:56| what is now the main level of the original building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| What are the considerations there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| Well, we actually began there two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| That's where we really started is looking at how can we connect from our new building across overhead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4145)|
| 1:09:12| to the existing hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| And as I mentioned earlier, there's some very unusually low floor-to-floor heights in the existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4154)|
| 1:09:20| So where we would be tying into and needing to access from our building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| we would have to get up to about the second or third floor level of our new building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| to get across to the hospital to go back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| So what's then in the hospital would be about five floors, maybe four to five floors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| something of that nature to get back down to that ground floor level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| So it's like you've got to go up, cross over, and go back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4180)|
| 1:09:46| But let me say also we have considered on the Laurel Street side of 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| we know that, again, addressing the various types of circulation that need to take place from a physician perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4191)|
| 1:09:57| and a staff perspective, we have addressed an overhead connector back there on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| again, on the low side of 19th at Laurel that goes into the trustee's tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| But that's another office building, so it's not a viable connection for patient traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| but it is a viable and important part for physicians to be able to go back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| potentially through whatever collaboration they may be doing from practice to practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4216)|
| 1:10:24| So on the drawings that we're looking at currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| the proposed main entrance of this office building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| it is on the same level as the critical care level of the original hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4234)|
| 1:10:40| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| It's actually about three feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| There's about three feet of differential between the first floor level of the new building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| which is at an elevation of 969, and the second level of the hospital, which is the ICU, at about 966.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4247)|
| 1:10:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| And that's another reason that that three-story connector at that top level doesn't connect in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| Not only are we going right into a patient care area, but the floor is not going to line up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| But a tunnel at that elevation, at the 969 where you come in, would not be high enough to clear traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4266)|
| 1:11:13| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| The street at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| But you have to come in the main level and go up and over and back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| Just like with the tunnel, you'd have to come in and go down and over and back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| I mean, it's kind of a U-turn either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| And the upper floors of that area, I know on the fourth floor is the existing hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4287)|
| 1:11:35| It's Patricia Neal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| So there's a lot of, again, that whole east end of the building, once you get on that second floor and above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| is very much clinical space and to try to introduce public traffic would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4301)|
| 1:11:46| Well, I mean, I think, I'm not an architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| but I would think that could be overcome by encapsulating some kind of foyer, entrance, elevator, service area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4309)|
| 1:11:56| Obviously, you would lose some patient care beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| but you could encapsulate a vertical column that would accommodate this kind of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| so that people aren't dumping out into patient care areas and thereby move your traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4323)|
| 1:12:09| Yeah, you would be giving up beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| All right, Jim, I'm seeing the lights right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| Do you have anything else you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| Vice Mayor, I just didn't want to hog all that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4338)|
| 1:12:21| I wanted to cycle back, going back to what you said, Mr. Holloway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4341)|
| 1:12:26| about the other rationale of getting patients across directly from the garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| and I think Mr. Becker addressed that to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| But the plan as unrevised, the plan that we got a week ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4355)|
| 1:12:47| indicates, again, an external connection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| which accomplishes what Mr. Becker was talking about where you come directly out of the garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4371)|
| 1:12:57| basically line of sight, rifle shot right over into the ER entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4377)|
| 1:13:03| the main ER public entrance doors, not the ambulance bay or the vestibule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| And that certainly makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| I can see where that would be desirable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| and it would be desirable to put a canopy over it if that route were taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| I think Mr. Becker's point is well taken in that people probably aren't going to go inside conditioned space to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4400)|
| 1:13:27| once they're in the garage, they're going to go the straightest, quickest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| most direct and obvious way they can to get into the ER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| I mean, I know I would if I were trying to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| And I guess the question, and again, I think Mr. Becker pointed this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| while there is some traffic, certainly, and congestion on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| it's an important street for traffic movement as well as for a variety of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4428)|
| 1:13:54| that we've already identified, access to the existing building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| and of course it would be for the new building and parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| But that street, while not ideal, it's functioned for years as access to the ER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4441)|
| 1:14:08| When that was a surface lot, I assume that most people that were going to the ER| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| parked in the surface lot and crossed the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4452)|
| 1:14:17| Are you all aware of any data that tells you either that they've had a problem at this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4457)|
| 1:14:26| with pedestrian crashes, pedestrian accidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4466)|
| 1:14:31| as a result of people crossing the street to get to the ER| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| or any of the hospital facility from the east side of 19th and that block?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4474)|
| 1:14:42| Are you aware of anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| Are you aware of also any data that they know, even anecdotal, where they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4484)|
| 1:14:50| well, we know that people had to stand on the other side of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| and couldn't get across the street to get to the ER in time and therefore X happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| That wouldn't have happened if they could have walked across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| without waiting for the traffic to slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| I'd probably let Keith address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| I know we have talked about that issue and I know there's been some around the perimeter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| whether at the ED, I don't know, but we'll let Keith address any specifics on incidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| that may have occurred around the campus due to sloping streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| Well, just due to crossing the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| Yes, Councilman, I haven't kept data on how many people may have been inconvenienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| or had to really traverse that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| Are you aware of any accidents as a result of people crossing that street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4535)|
| 1:15:39| I haven't seen any accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| I have heard complaints from patients from time to time about the inconvenience of there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| about the slopes of that lot and a lot of issues associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| Remember, we've got slopes of the lot or slopes crossing the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| Those are two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| Well, they're still not, again, they're not ADA accessible either way now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| I think we would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| And, you know, I think with all the discussion, it's important to consider we have probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| I think, approaching 45,000 ED visits a year now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| And with the closing of Baptist Hospital downtown, that is rising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| And so I think our concern about getting those ED patients from that area over to the ED| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4573)|
| 1:16:19| is going to even be more exasperated with increased traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| And I don't challenge that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| I think that's a reasonable statement that your ED census is going up and that it's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4586)|
| 1:16:32| Access is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| Thanks for answering the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| Is there anything, gentlemen, you wish to add to your architectural issues presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| I would just say in a wrap-up from our point of view is we, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| we feel that for the continuity of the design and the flow and the operational efficiency of this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4608)|
| 1:16:55| that we've discussed, the safety, the patient safety issues and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| we really are convinced that the closure of 19th really is best not only on the short term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4620)|
| 1:17:06| but certainly for the long term of this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| So I just wanted to emphasize that one last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| Council Member Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| I've just got what may be a dumb question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| What happens if we don't close the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4637)|
| 1:17:25| Well, we might want to ask Covenant that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| Anybody can answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| I mean, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| I think we would absolutely have to go back to medical staff and our board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| and question whether or not the expenditure of $80 million on the first phase at this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4657)|
| 1:17:43| would still be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| Council Member Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| Harold, or Ms. Petty, excuse me, a question along those lines for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4671)|
| 1:17:57| Mr. Petty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| In your professional opinion, will this building work if the street is not closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4680)|
| 1:18:10| Can it be made to work at a functional level if the street is not closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4690)|
| 1:18:16| and just the lower level connector tunnel is built into that main entry level of the existing building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4696)|
| 1:18:25| Based on my two-year working knowledge of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| beginning with looking at the existing facility, looking at where all the departments were located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4709)|
| 1:18:34| looking at where all the elevators, where all the public entries are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| where all the other non-public areas are located and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| and looking at the goals and objectives that have been set forth by spending $80 million, as Keith said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4722)|
| 1:18:49| to solve these issues and to help them position themselves for the future, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| it's a mistake not to close 19th to solve those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| Is that answering your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| No, I don't think it's answering my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| I hear what you're saying, but my question is, will the new building be able to function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4742)|
| 1:19:09| and will the connection to the existing building be able to function at a level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| that would meet reasonable medical standards for medical facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4754)|
| 1:19:20| of which you have experience with a variety of new and existing facilities around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4760)|
| 1:19:26| based on your experience with new and existing facilities that often aren't connected in optimum ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4766)|
| 1:19:32| could this building function effectively at an acceptable level given those standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4772)|
| 1:19:40| Not optimum, not necessarily meeting all the goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4784)|
| 1:19:45| Not all the goals, that's not my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| Can it function at an acceptable level as a medical facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| In my opinion, it would be a dysfunctional building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| Again, based on all the knowledge that I have of this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| and based on my interaction and discussions with physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| and what they're trying to achieve in terms of the clinical continuity of their patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| so I have to qualify my answer by saying if we didn't do these things, the answer is no, it's not functional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4808)|
| 1:20:15| And it does not meet the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| I'm not sure that you made the case, but thank you for the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| Council Member Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| Well, just to tie into that line of questioning and information gathering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4824)|
| 1:20:34| it seems to me that we're almost talking about two little animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| We're going to call them both a hospital facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| But it appears to me that, if I understand correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| the main goal is to redesign the hospital so that it functions more appropriately for these times and the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4846)|
| 1:20:55| And I was telling Bob, you know, they think I'm older than dirt, so it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4855)|
| 1:21:01| But seriously, I was born in that hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| and the hospital had been there a long time before I came out the front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4864)|
| 1:21:13| So, you know, I can remember when that little hospital was this cute little tutor structure there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4873)|
| 1:21:18| very attractive and really fit right into the fort because it just was so picturesque.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4878)|
| 1:21:25| And we've all seen those postcards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| Well, I've also experienced soft changes that Fort Sanders and now Covenant has experienced in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4887)|
| 1:21:37| and why those changes have happened because that is such an absolutely viable, important facility to the fort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4897)|
| 1:21:46| but to the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| And it just seems to me that what I feel your goal, your physician's goal, may well be is to have ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4908)|
| 1:21:58| it's a very disconnected facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| It's not my favorite place to visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| The only other place that's worse is St. Mary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| Because it, too, has just been built onto, and it has changed its character so many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4924)|
| 1:22:11| But it seems to me that the goal you're trying to achieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| which I think is why you're pushing for this street closure, is to have a new entrance, to have a new look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4934)|
| 1:22:23| to have a new way for patients to be admitted and for families, friends, to visit their patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4943)|
| 1:22:33| Because the way we do that now there is very complicated in my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4953)|
| 1:22:39| and not at all easy for someone who hasn't been familiar with a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| So it seems to me just in my conversations that I've had with people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4963)|
| 1:22:52| with everything that's been said and the different little hearings that we've had over this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4972)|
| 1:22:58| both at MPC and BZA and here, and I've listened to all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| that really what you're honestly trying to accomplish is to have a structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4983)|
| 1:23:09| that encompasses both the doctor's offices, the parking, and all of the clinical services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4989)|
| 1:23:17| And to me, this would just be a doctor's building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=4997)|
| 1:23:24| Am I right, if there's no connectivity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| If there was no connectivity, it would primarily just be a physician's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| but I'm not sure they would be happy being there if they weren't connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| And I think that's the whole goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5016)|
| 1:23:41| I think we need to understand what the entire goal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| What is the determining factor for the $80 million to be spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5026)|
| 1:23:53| Well, I may want to let Keith speak to that, but can I add one thought to your thinking there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5033)|
| 1:24:00| What's happening now in many, many hospitals, so many services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| clinical services are going on an outpatient basis, as you well know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| And as we go around the country right now, we're seeing more and more older facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| that are kind of encapsulated in city streets like Fort Sanders is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| where they've got outpatient services are kind of scattered all around the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| It's not uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| It's just something that is very cumbersome if you're an outpatient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| and you're going into an inpatient setting for outpatient services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| So the goal, part of the goal here, is to pull some of those outpatient services out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| those high-volume outpatient services, and get them into a facility where they're convenient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5074)|
| 1:24:39| not only for the patient to come in and register in and go have clinical services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| but also for those physicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| And for the families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| And for the families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| I think the Patricia Neal Rehabilitation Center is such a, it's just such a wonderful regional asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5088)|
| 1:24:55| But I have always felt that it was just the most, I have a daughter who's a physical therapist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| She worked there for a period of time and interned there when she was in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| Very complicated, very difficult facility to go to on a regular basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5103)|
| 1:25:10| or to visit if you have family members there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| But I do know from having designed many, many hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| and similar situations as we discussed here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| that there are many patients that will go into an outpatient setting, see their physicians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5119)|
| 1:25:24| get some diagnostic testing that can't be done in an outpatient setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| And they say, we need to move you into the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| Or in some cases they may say, you're a direct admit to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| You need to go right now and get admitted to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| Or you need to be seen in a certain department of this hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| So part of all this, again, is a very complex issues here of trying to solve all these clinical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5143)|
| 1:25:50| and operational issues to make this a viable project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| and a healthy project for the community and the patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| and to make it easy for the physicians to see their patients and have great clinical outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5156)|
| 1:26:03| But if this were just a physician's office building, someone else would have to speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| and I'm not sure the physicians would want to be there if they didn't have that kind of connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5167)|
| 1:26:15| Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| Give me one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5177)|
| 1:26:18| I guess just two quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| Well, let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| Steve needs to leave, and I just want to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| I guess first, I have to leave soon anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| I don't think I've ever left a workshop early, and I apologize to the audience members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| But I have to leave in about 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| I wanted to thank Steve for the question you asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| At some level, I think that got a lot to the crux of it, and I appreciate the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5197)|
| 1:26:41| I mean, some people would dance around that, and I think you said real clearly, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| we'd have to reconsider our options and look at locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| And I think this is another part of sort of the ongoing challenge of being a city is we're in a built environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| If this was all empty land, it would be real easy to design this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| You could make the buildings whatever height, then you could, you know, regrade, and it's a challenge we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5216)|
| 1:27:01| And I guess some of the truth is that the walkway that's causing the closure of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5221)|
| 1:27:08| it might or might not be critical, but it's real nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| And for a lot of the other options in hospitals, it's easy to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| So I think it's something we have to struggle with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| And I guess I wanted to say to Steve, thanks for asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| You know, it definitely was not a stupid question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| Well, I just wanted to get straight to the point and find out what are we arguing about, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5244)|
| 1:27:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| Did you have anything else, Council Member Pelow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| Well, I didn't unless I can't pronounce your last name. I'm embarrassed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5254)|
| 1:27:39| Oh, that's all right. It's an old name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| That was my dad's name. I can say Keith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| Oh, sure. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| No, I appreciate your comments, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| You know, one of the things we are trying to do is not just to have another medical office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5266)|
| 1:27:51| We've got several medical office buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| We've got a million square feet of space in that whole complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| We're trying to create a lot of the design criteria that the architects have previously spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5277)|
| 1:28:02| We do need a front entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| If you ask them, and I think I did this two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| I didn't tell them how to get to the hospital and get to my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| I told them I was on the first floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| And they couldn't figure out where the entrance was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| And many, many people that come in to see us that haven't been there before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| they don't know where the entrance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| And when you happen to see the elderly and the infirm coming down across the Thompson lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5300)|
| 1:28:25| across from Clinch, which is where most of them are parking now trying to get to the front door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| in the rain, on that slope, traversing those sidewalks and trying to get in, it scares me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5309)|
| 1:28:35| And it's unfair, I think, to the citizens when we have an opportunity to improve that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5315)|
| 1:28:40| to continue to have, you know, that kind of access to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| And getting back to the building, again, not just being a medical office building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| the vision there is not just to have the front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| It's not just to improve ED access and get ADA compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5330)|
| 1:28:54| It's also to have a nice continuum of care from those medical office buildings where we're going to put,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5334)|
| 1:29:00| I'm sure, eventually, a lot of outpatient services that are very, very complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5340)|
| 1:29:05| and I think are, in fact, going to have to have a lot of connectivity back to that hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5345)|
| 1:29:10| where we have imaging services, where we have our cath labs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| We're going to have to have connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| And to have that vision of not just the front door, but a great place for ED,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| for access and egress to that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| And to have that continuity and flow from those medical office buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| and those outpatient services back to our main facility is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| The other thing I think I'd like to comment on was trying to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| and take out some of our critical care beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| You know, when Baptist Downtown went down, I think we lost 22 critical care beds in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5377)|
| 1:29:44| And I don't know, but if you check with all the hospitals in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| we're all full in terms of critical care space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| You know, there is not much room at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| And so if we talk about taking more of those beds offline for a connector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| we're really doing another disservice to the folks that need that critical care service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| You know, Councilman Hall just left, but he's an absolutely incredible example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5400)|
| 1:30:07| of someone who could not receive critical care here when he had his accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5407)|
| 1:30:12| And so he wound up in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| And I think it was directly as a result of just the sudden change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| in the ability to have those emergency services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| and those beds available to the patients who needed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| So he was transported all the way to Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| and I just thought it was so ironic that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5430)|
| 1:30:34| that he should be one of those who fell into that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5434)|
| 1:30:40| And it was not at all convenient for the family or for anybody to visit him in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5440)|
| 1:30:45| And I think that's the one thing that concerns me so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| if we handicap the ability for our existing medical services to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5448)|
| 1:30:55| and to do what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| And then, you know, my husband is not a real doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| Next time I'm marrying a real doctor, I can see the financial advantages of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5461)|
| 1:31:06| But I'm married to a dentist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| And, you know, I know how difficult it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| and how important it is to a community to recruit the very best medical personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5472)|
| 1:31:18| And, heck, I don't want to go to Sloan Ketterling or wherever we go in Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| I want to be here where my family is to be taken care of in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5483)|
| 1:31:27| So I want to be sure that we as a community really give support to the physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5487)|
| 1:31:34| who are willing to come here and start their lives and become a part of this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5494)|
| 1:31:40| because I want to hang around a year or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| And, you know, I think that's critical to me, to my family, and to this community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5503)|
| 1:31:49| And I've just always thought that Fort Sanders was just so fortunate to have this wonderful facility right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5509)|
| 1:31:56| Because I do think, and I know we're going to talk about its impact on business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5516)|
| 1:32:02| but I do think it has always had an incredibly positive impact on the business in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5522)|
| 1:32:11| And I've got 70-plus years of, you know, seeing how business in that area worked around the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5531)|
| 1:32:20| and its presence there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| I mean, this is a terribly difficult issue because I realize it's very problematical to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5544)|
| 1:32:31| Immediate community itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| But when I look at the bigger picture, I can see that it's really critical to us all, and even to the region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5554)|
| 1:32:42| that we try to find some way to make this work so that Covenant can continue to operate within the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5562)|
| 1:32:53| I just, you know, my district houses a number of hospitals out west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5573)|
| 1:32:59| But, hey, everybody doesn't need, want to be transported in that direction to receive their medical care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5579)|
| 1:33:07| They want to be right here where they live and right here where they feel such a part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5587)|
| 1:33:15| And they want to be a part of this facility that has such a good history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| I think it's really tough for me, and I just wanted to be able to say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| to make a decision that I know may not just be what everybody's hoping we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5604)|
| 1:33:31| But let's be, there's an old saying about throwing out the baby with bathwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| And I kind of want to keep both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| So you've got to find some way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| I'd like to next go to Council Member Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| Then I'd like to encourage us to realize that it's almost 640, and we have three other areas to cover here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5623)|
| 1:33:51| I notice we also have public here that may want to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5631)|
| 1:33:55| And I've already lost a couple of council members and have another one who's going to have to leave and may lose others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5635)|
| 1:34:01| And we don't want that to seem as if council is disinterested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| But we want to also make sure this is a very important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| And I don't know if because it's so important it's going to necessitate an additional discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| But I wanted to point out we do have a lot of other substantive issues to cover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| if maybe after Council Member Woodhull speaks that we can maybe move on into the transportation, traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| and mobility part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| Because I think Mr. D'Angelo, we've already lost him also, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5664)|
| 1:34:28| Council Member Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5668)|
| 1:34:29| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| I have to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5671)|
| 1:34:32| That's what I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| I am glad that we had this workshop, and it's been very helpful and informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5674)|
| 1:34:39| And I will listen to the tape for the additional comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5679)|
| 1:34:45| You know, oftentimes when people are talking about their project, that's all they talk about is their project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5685)|
| 1:34:51| And I haven't heard a whole lot about concern for how the hospital fits into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5691)|
| 1:34:58| However, I did hear you say that you repeatedly met with the neighborhood, which that was very good to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5698)|
| 1:35:05| And then I also heard Randall DeFord, an architect, make mention of some kind of collaboration with the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5705)|
| 1:35:15| Could someone comment to me on what he was referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5715)|
| 1:35:21| which seemed to be that the hospital was willing to work with the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5721)|
| 1:35:30| Did I just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| It was the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| It started with an H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| Harb property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5736)|
| 1:35:37| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5737)|
| 1:35:38| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| The Harb property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5741)|
| 1:35:42| H-A-R-B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5742)|
| 1:35:43| I certainly hope somebody other than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| There was something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| Randall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5746)|
| 1:35:47| Do you want to hear from the hospital or me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| Sure, you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| What was the arrangement that you understood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| Well, there is no arrangement yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| But there was some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| We met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| John Craig and myself met with Keith Altshuler and Danny Edsel and Max Shell and Ellen Carmichael to discuss this idea of partnering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5759)|
| 1:36:11| And the idea is that now that the neighborhood association or folks, members of the neighborhood association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5771)|
| 1:36:17| have formed this community development corporation, we're looking for partners to help make it viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5777)|
| 1:36:27| Our ragtag group has raised about $15,000, but $15,000, as good as it is, is not enough to make a huge impact in Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5787)|
| 1:36:36| And the hospital has recently purchased three houses and a store that are in the overlay area that are in rough shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5796)|
| 1:36:45| but have tremendous architectural importance to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| They also have an empty lot across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| So we approached them to ask if they would consider donating those properties into the CDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5812)|
| 1:37:00| perhaps with some cash to help us with the goal that these houses would be restored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5820)|
| 1:37:05| and the empty lot would receive an infill house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| and all four of those houses then would be sold to the public with deed restrictions for owner occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5829)|
| 1:37:18| right there at the hospital to build a core community that holds all the people it should accountable for their actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5838)|
| 1:37:28| You know, it's really, I'm convinced, it's owner occupants that are not afraid to call the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5848)|
| 1:37:34| because the neighbors are having an out-of-control party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| So you made that proposal, and what was the response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| Well, I'll let Keith talk about that, but it was friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| Randall, tell me again how you referred to the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| The Harb properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| The KRB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| I'm sorry, I just, my ears didn't pick that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| That was the name of the family who owned the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| And then the other property, I called it an unimproved lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| It's just vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| Well, again, we just got this proposal maybe two weeks or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| and so our board hasn't taken any action on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| I will tell you that it was requested that we donate up to $2 million of seed money into this corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5889)|
| 1:38:16| and I will just say, based on history of our company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| we have not used those kinds of dollars for anything other than health care in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| And so even though the board has not acted on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| our history has been to devote those funds to health care endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| Now, we have offered in the past to donate one of those lots to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| or to the neighborhood that we do have that's vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| They had talked to us in the past about turning that into a doggy park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| or having some buffer space for another type of park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| I don't know what all could be done with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| and we have already said many times you can have that do whatever you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| because we don't have plans to use that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5929)|
| 1:38:53| But the concept of going out and buying and providing seed money for the redo of the Victorian houses there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5933)|
| 1:38:59| is just something we haven't considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| and we find that to be historically not where we put our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5941)|
| 1:39:07| But it's something you'll consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| Well, we will take it to the board to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| but I don't want to give false impressions that it's going to have a positive approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| in terms of what the board would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| Do you feel like it's important for a hospital to be a good neighbor to the neighborhood you're in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5956)|
| 1:39:23| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| In what way do you find that it's important to be a good neighbor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| Well, first of all, I think having such a strong hospital facility right there close to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| is an absolute asset a lot of us would like to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| And, in fact, some of the neighborhood board members have said they intend to have their babies there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5977)|
| 1:39:41| They want to be able to use that hospital with such a good reputation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| and such a level of specialty care to have good care for their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| That's definitely something we've been doing for a number of years and will continue to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| And then the hospitals would want to be in locations that are strong in terms of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5992)|
| 1:39:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| And not struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=5999)|
| 1:40:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6000)|
| 1:40:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6001)|
| 1:40:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6002)|
| 1:40:03| Council Member Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| Mr. Altshuler, a quick follow-up to Councilman Woodhull's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| Do you have an appraised value for the city right-of-way that's proposed to be closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6008)|
| 1:40:19| from 19th Street right-of-way from Clinch Avenue to Laurel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6019)|
| 1:40:23| Do you have an appraisal or an appraised value or some idea of what the value of that real estate is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6023)|
| 1:40:31| No, sir, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6031)|
| 1:40:32| But I do know that we give millions and millions of dollars in free uncompensated care to the community every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6032)|
| 1:40:38| That was not my question, but that's nice to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| But I'm just trying to figure out, do you know anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| do you not know of anyone who's appraised that or said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| gosh, if we had to buy this, it would cost us X amount of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6047)|
| 1:40:52| If this were in this locale, given the location where it is and all that, it would cost us X amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6052)|
| 1:41:01| No, sir, we haven't spent any time looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6065)|
| 1:41:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| Let's move on to the traffic, transportation, and mobility portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| Mr. Hollis Loveday, he was listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| And after that, I think Dr. Coolash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| Yes, Mr. Loveday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| I've got a handout here that I want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6083)|
| 1:41:24| You can just start it on the end there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| We'll pass it around and you can go back to the podium and begin speaking so you don't have to hand it out to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| But we'll make sure that those council members who are not here will get their copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6090)|
| 1:41:41| I am Hollis Loveday with Wilbur Smith Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| I live at 4801 Shannon Run Drive in Knoxville, 67918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6104)|
| 1:41:50| And I'm handing out a copy of a summary of our studies and analysis today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6110)|
| 1:41:59| We started out with an initial traffic study that we conducted in January and February of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6119)|
| 1:42:07| We submitted it in 2008, February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| And that study looked at the impact of closing 19th Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6131)|
| 1:42:17| and the traffic generated by a new medical office building that we've been discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6137)|
| 1:42:23| It also looked at pedestrian flow in and around 19th Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6143)|
| 1:42:29| and attempted to assess how much traffic on 19th Street was associated with the hospital and how much of it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6149)|
| 1:42:37| Later on, as a result of the request from the Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6157)|
| 1:42:42| we went back and we expanded the traffic study to include more intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6162)|
| 1:42:48| and also to include an assessment of the Cumberland Avenue road diet project on the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6168)|
| 1:42:58| So we looked at all three things together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| The closure of 19th Street, the medical office building, and the Cumberland Avenue road diet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6181)|
| 1:43:08| So that's page 2 of the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| Page 3 of the handout shows the study area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| It includes 29 intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| It's bounded by Grand on the north, 17th Street on the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6198)|
| 1:43:24| Cumberland Avenue on the south, and 22nd Street on the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6204)|
| 1:43:29| The red and white intersections in the illustration are the original study area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6209)|
| 1:43:36| The black intersections are the new study area intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6216)|
| 1:43:41| If you look at page 4, this is the classification street system in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6221)|
| 1:43:49| You'll notice that 22nd Street and 16th Street are the two north-south collector streets in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6229)|
| 1:43:57| 19th Street is not a classified road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| It's a local street, so its primary purpose is to provide access to abutting property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6240)|
| 1:44:09| Page 5 is land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| The yellow color denotes medical center land use, including Children's Hospital and Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6252)|
| 1:44:19| The orange color denotes commercial land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| The blue is the Fort Sanders School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| The land use that's not color-coded is primarily either parking lot or residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6266)|
| 1:44:34| Page 6 is the existing one-way street network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6274)|
| 1:44:40| You'll see that it's perhaps a little bit unorganized at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6280)|
| 1:44:45| There are two streets, 20th and 21st, which are essentially one-way pairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6285)|
| 1:44:52| Then White Street and Laurel are one-way eastbound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6292)|
| 1:44:57| 19th Street is two-way, except for two blocks on the very northern portion of the study area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6297)|
| 1:45:07| Page 7 is a pedestrian count of traffic in and around 19th Street, crossing 19th Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6307)|
| 1:45:14| and pedestrian traffic walking up and down 19th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6314)|
| 1:45:20| Page 8, and this is critical, the average daily traffic volume on 19th Street in this block is 4,661 vehicles, as shown on page 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6320)|
| 1:45:35| We don't know exactly how much traffic of that is hospital traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6335)|
| 1:45:41| We think it's a very large percent, but we have not been able to quantify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6341)|
| 1:45:46| I could say the same thing about pedestrian flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6346)|
| 1:45:49| We have not quantified the amount of pedestrian flow that's hospital versus other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6349)|
| 1:45:56| but we think the vast majority of that is also related to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6356)|
| 1:46:05| Page 9 shows the overall daily traffic impact to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6365)|
| 1:46:11| The medical office building, we expect to generate about 8,250 trips per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6371)|
| 1:46:17| The 19th Street in that block currently accommodates, as I said before, 4,661 trips a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6377)|
| 1:46:26| In the Cumberland Avenue road diet, we met with the city staff, and we met with MPC staff and hospital entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6386)|
| 1:46:38| and we collectively decided that we think that a worst-case scenario is the Cumberland Avenue road diet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6398)|
| 1:46:45| will divert about 5% of the traffic on Cumberland Avenue into the Fort Sanders neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6405)|
| 1:46:52| Again, I should emphasize I think that's a worst-case scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6412)|
| 1:46:57| but I think it's incumbent on us to try to look at the most conservative approach possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6417)|
| 1:47:05| Now, the next two illustrations show on page 10, I'm illustrating the levels of delay that we measured today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6425)|
| 1:47:17| The intersections that are shown in green are experiencing acceptable levels of delay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6437)|
| 1:47:24| and the intersections in red are experiencing probably less than desirable levels of delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6444)|
| 1:47:31| There are two intersections of the 29 that are currently experiencing less than desirable levels of delay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6451)|
| 1:47:39| and that is 20th Street at Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6459)|
| 1:47:44| If you've attempted to turn onto Cumberland Avenue from any of those cross streets, it's very difficult to do sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6464)|
| 1:47:52| so that's not surprising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| The other one is Grand Avenue at 17th Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6474)|
| 1:47:58| and I think there again the left turns that occur there are probably less than desirable in terms of delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6478)|
| 1:48:07| Now, if you turn to the next illustration on page 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6487)|
| 1:48:12| this is the levels of delay that we would expect from the intersections if 19th Street is closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6492)|
| 1:48:20| if the Cumberland Avenue Road Dot is implemented and the 5% of traffic diverts into the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6500)|
| 1:48:27| and also if the medical office building is constructed and is operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6507)|
| 1:48:32| If you'll notice, there are no changes in colors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6512)|
| 1:48:35| All of the intersections that we analyzed, all 29 of those, are expected to operate similarly as they do today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6515)|
| 1:48:43| and I might add, too, that we also added a growth rate, a general growth rate to these intersections as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6523)|
| 1:48:51| So I'll turn to the last page, and I'll just summarize it very quickly by saying, again, the impact is on 4,661 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6531)|
| 1:49:03| Many of those trips are hospital trips, and I think the second bullet is probably the most critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6543)|
| 1:49:12| A minute ago, the question was asked, could the building function,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| could the new proposed hospital building function without the connection and without 19th Street closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6557)|
| 1:49:25| And luckily, I don't have to answer that question, but the question can also be asked of the road system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6565)|
| 1:49:33| Can the road system function adequately if 19th Street is closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6573)|
| 1:49:39| And this would be with the new medical office building and with the impacts to the Cumberland Avenue Road Dot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6579)|
| 1:49:45| The answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| The answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6587)|
| 1:49:48| The road system can function adequately if that link of road is taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6588)|
| 1:49:55| One of the reasons why the road system can function adequately with that link out is because it is a grid system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6595)|
| 1:50:04| It's a wonderful system that we have, and there are other roads within that area that are capable of accommodating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6604)|
| 1:50:13| and picking up the slack, absorbing that additional traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6613)|
| 1:50:17| So in our case, the bottom line is that the road system without that link will still function adequately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6617)|
| 1:50:25| And with this, I will entertain questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6625)|
| 1:50:32| Yes, Council Member Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| Did you give us a percentage somewhere along here on how many trips per day were oriented towards the hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6635)|
| 1:50:45| Did you give us any sort of a statistic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6645)|
| 1:50:50| No, we don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6650)|
| 1:50:51| I think that in terms of daily trips, the hospital is probably generating about 15,000, and that's just a very loose guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6651)|
| 1:51:00| And I'm talking about 19th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6660)|
| 1:51:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6662)|
| 1:51:03| Well, the total count on 19th Street is 4,661,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6663)|
| 1:51:07| and we don't know for sure what percent of that traffic is hospital, but we think it's a very large percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6667)|
| 1:51:15| Well, like when you say large percent, kind of give me a ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6675)|
| 1:51:22| I would hesitate to venture to say maybe 75%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6682)|
| 1:51:27| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6687)|
| 1:51:28| That's just a guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6688)|
| 1:51:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6689)|
| 1:51:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6690)|
| 1:51:31| 50% is a safe guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6691)|
| 1:51:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| Council Member Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6694)|
| 1:51:37| Mr. Lode, I have a question, and I know you won't be able to get a great answer because you won't without doing further study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6697)|
| 1:51:47| but if 19th Street is closed and then 21st Street were to be closed at a later date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6707)|
| 1:51:56| would you say that that might, looking at your language, would that significantly impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6716)|
| 1:52:07| or would the system then be capable of absorbing the traffic that exists or that is anticipated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6727)|
| 1:52:18| Probably, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| And the reason I say that, the green dots are actually very good levels of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6740)|
| 1:52:26| and I'm trying to avoid talking a lot of traffic engineering speak here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6746)|
| 1:52:29| but the delays are very moderate and very acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| And so I think that without doing further analysis, my guess would be yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6754)|
| 1:52:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| Mr. Walter Kulasch, thank you so much, and we appreciate the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6763)|
| 1:52:48| Mr. Kulasch, do you need to stay where your computer is or do you need to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| I think in the interest of time we'll skip that and I'll just give you a verbal description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6772)|
| 1:52:56| That will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6776)|
| 1:52:57| And if you have some handouts or want to have copies of handouts provided to us at a later date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6777)|
| 1:53:02| we can get it to the council office for your comments, and we'll make sure it gets circulated to all council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6782)|
| 1:53:07| Okay, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6787)|
| 1:53:08| We'll have your presentation copied off and given to the council office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6788)|
| 1:53:12| We can have that circulated also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6793)|
| 1:53:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6794)|
| 1:53:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6795)|
| 1:53:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6796)|
| 1:53:17| I'm Walter Kulasch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6797)|
| 1:53:18| I'm a registered professional engineer, traffic engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6798)|
| 1:53:22| I've had considerable experience in dealing with neighborhood traffic in the vicinity of hospitals at 11 locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6802)|
| 1:53:29| ranging from a small denominational hospital in Texarkana to a maximum at the Cleveland Clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6809)|
| 1:53:40| I have reviewed very carefully the traffic study that was just referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6820)|
| 1:53:46| that was done by Wilbur Smith and Associates, and also the background material that supports that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6826)|
| 1:53:52| not included in the current package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| In my opinion, it's a very workmanlike and competent effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| and I agree with it completely or certainly agree with it in great measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| I'm not surprised by the finding that we can absorb within the grid of streets the impacts of both the expanded hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6845)|
| 1:54:15| and the closure of a street for exactly the reasons that the previous speaker just referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6855)|
| 1:54:22| which is that we have a grid of streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6862)|
| 1:54:25| We're also the first ones to impair that grid, so it's sort of a first-come, first-served thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6865)|
| 1:54:34| I would maintain, though, that the traffic measure that's looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| the traffic level of service that Wilbur Smith was charged with looking at in this study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6878)|
| 1:54:46| is only one of the traffic impact measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6886)|
| 1:54:50| and it maybe is even the least significant of the traffic impact measures that we should be addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6890)|
| 1:54:57| What are some of the other ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| Certainly the additional closures, the idea of additional closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6899)|
| 1:55:02| We've found around college campuses and medical institutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6902)|
| 1:55:10| in many cases, that granting one street closure starts the city off on the slippery slope of granting more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6910)|
| 1:55:20| There are very few technical traffic engineering reasons you can give for not granting them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6920)|
| 1:55:27| until you hit the wall of no more capacity, and then you have to say it won't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6927)|
| 1:55:32| Again, the previous speaker just alluded to that kind of cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6932)|
| 1:55:36| So it becomes very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| The list of claimants that will come looking for street closure is very long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6938)|
| 1:55:45| and all of them appear to be worthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| Medical institutions, how worthy can you get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6947)|
| 1:55:50| Educational, social, recreational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6950)|
| 1:55:53| So the only valid answer, this is kind of like free speech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| the only valid answer to avoiding the slippery slope is to just not grant it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6957)|
| 1:56:04| The longer range integrity of the street system is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| We are removing a quarter of the North-South capacity in the entire district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6968)|
| 1:56:16| That capacity is important not only for the traffic within the time frame that the traffic study looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6976)|
| 1:56:23| but a time frame beyond that in which we're talking about much more redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| along the northern part of the Fort Sanders area and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6988)|
| 1:56:33| The traffic impact study accurately, in my opinion, says with those green spots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=6993)|
| 1:56:41| that we don't change the traffic level of service significantly at any location with this closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7001)|
| 1:56:48| We do, however, inflict more driving time and delay on the motoring public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7008)|
| 1:56:54| Because obviously if you can't go directly on the route you previously took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7014)|
| 1:56:59| and have to make a longer trip, you are incurring more travel time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7019)|
| 1:57:05| So how much travel time does that amount to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7025)|
| 1:57:09| Using the numbers from the traffic impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7029)|
| 1:57:14| which were very nicely computed on a block-by-block basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7034)|
| 1:57:19| we compute an additional 204 daily vehicle miles of travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7039)|
| 1:57:26| If you run that through the numbers of what does a vehicle mile cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7046)|
| 1:57:32| you get a figure of about $37,000 annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7052)|
| 1:57:36| If you do the same thing with travel time, the additional time spent by the drivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7056)|
| 1:57:42| run it through the numbers, you get $77,000 annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| or about $100,000 of cost inflicted on the driving public because of this closing of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7065)|
| 1:57:55| Even though we haven't changed the traffic level of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| we are upping the amount of travel and delay that's being caused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7078)|
| 1:58:04| Now, what is this being balanced against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| If we're inflicting, for example, 204 more hours daily of travel on the motoring public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7087)|
| 1:58:14| that might be a good cost if it was being balanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7094)|
| 1:58:20| by some sort of travel time savings to the hospital traffic on just traffic terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7100)|
| 1:58:27| But it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| In fact, looking at the traffic study very carefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7109)|
| 1:58:33| it appears that we probably are not saving any travel time to hospital users at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7113)|
| 1:58:39| So on a purely traffic, looking at purely the automobile service equation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7119)|
| 1:58:44| it's a very bad deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7124)|
| 1:58:47| Are there other calculable savings within the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7127)|
| 1:58:52| that compensate for this kind of cost to the external traveling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7132)|
| 1:58:57| So I was very interested in the discussion earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| in which it was clear that the additional cost to hospital users,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7140)|
| 1:59:04| the additional travel cost to hospital users,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| is of not having the second level of bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7147)|
| 1:59:13| and therefore not having to close the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| The additional cost is one floor down in an elevator ride| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7156)|
| 1:59:20| and one floor up in an elevator ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7160)|
| 1:59:22| At typical elevator speeds, that's about eight seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7162)|
| 1:59:26| That says then that we would have to have, and I worked the numbers out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7166)|
| 1:59:31| we would have to have 13,000 daily trips that had to use the emergency level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7171)|
| 1:59:39| that had to go that extra floor to just compensate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| for the additional motorist time that we're inflicting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7182)|
| 1:59:47| So I don't want to get too wrapped up in numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| but I just want to make the point that we see a calculable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7189)|
| 1:59:54| and significant, 210 hours of travel is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| We would do a major intersection improvement to improve it by 210 travel hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7197)|
| 2:00:03| So we're seeing major cost inflicted on the users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7203)|
| 2:00:07| At the short range future projections that are in the traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7207)|
| 2:00:13| we're seeing no reported savings to the hospital users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7213)|
| 2:00:17| So we have to wonder from a transportation point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7217)|
| 2:00:21| transportation meaning vehicular transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| and transporting of the people through the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7223)|
| 2:00:26| what is this being, where is the benefit in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7226)|
| 2:00:31| The neighborhood impacts were not looked at in the study, in the traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7231)|
| 2:00:37| and it's completely understandable that they were not included in the scope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7237)|
| 2:00:41| but we just need to point out that there's a wide range of neighborhood impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7241)|
| 2:00:47| that need to be computed before we can make a final conclusion about this closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7247)|
| 2:00:54| And some of these impacts include the additional vehicles passing by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7254)|
| 2:01:00| the number of residents and residential lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| kind of an index of how much traffic is being gained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| The safety degradation for pedestrian safety on all the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7267)|
| 2:01:13| surrounding the hospital complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| because we will have an increase in turning movements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7276)|
| 2:01:19| ranging from 10 to 60 percent at all the corner intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7279)|
| 2:01:23| because of the diverted traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| exactly the locations at which there's most pedestrian traffic now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7285)|
| 2:01:29| That needs to be computed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7289)|
| 2:01:31| Since a lot of the discussion about why we need the bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7291)|
| 2:01:34| is based on pedestrian convenience and safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7294)|
| 2:01:36| then we need to understand what we're doing externally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7296)|
| 2:01:41| Another factor is public safety service providers, fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7301)|
| 2:01:48| They invariably, through their national organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| and through the National Fire Protection Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| espouse a complete network of streets with multiple paths to every,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7314)|
| 2:02:00| as they call it, event site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| And so by removing a street, you by definition impair that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7322)|
| 2:02:08| And then finally, the alternative traffic calming measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| that we could do on 19th if it were to remain open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| I don't think we've explored those practically at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7334)|
| 2:02:18| In some of the hospital locations we've worked in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| there are some very attractive, safe, and even ingenious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7342)|
| 2:02:28| traffic calming measures that can be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| if you are still crossing some of your people at grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| which is the situation we'd have if we had only a single level of tunnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7354)|
| 2:02:38| And some of those things are a very much narrowed street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7358)|
| 2:02:42| Actually making concessions so that the elevators could go in the street right away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7362)|
| 2:02:47| if they had to and help save the building floor plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| Signalization features such as the signals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7370)|
| 2:02:55| mid-block signals that are always red until actuated by a vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7375)|
| 2:03:00| and all sorts of pavement and landscaping treatments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7380)|
| 2:03:04| that would make a very special character for the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7384)|
| 2:03:07| I don't think there would be any doubt then on the medical office tenant's mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7387)|
| 2:03:14| that this is in fact a unique, coherent, single atmosphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7394)|
| 2:03:19| I appreciate this opportunity to talk to you about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7399)|
| 2:03:24| and would be glad to deal with any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7404)|
| 2:03:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7407)|
| 2:03:28| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7408)|
| 2:03:29| And as I said, if you want to have a copy of your actual presentation that you have on your laptop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7409)|
| 2:03:35| provide the council, just provide a copy to the council office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7415)|
| 2:03:38| or maybe to Councilman Holquist and then make sure to circulate that, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7418)|
| 2:03:43| We appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7423)|
| 2:03:44| Council Member Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7424)|
| 2:03:45| Mr. Kulash, before you leave the podium, I wanted to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7425)|
| 2:03:49| I don't know if anybody else has any questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7429)|
| 2:03:53| You were the, I guess most council members remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| that you were the lead on the transportation part of the planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7436)|
| 2:04:00| the vision plan and form-based code development for the south waterfront here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7440)|
| 2:04:04| but you were also the principal in charge, did I get this right, of the Cumberland Avenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7444)|
| 2:04:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7450)|
| 2:04:11| Plan development that Gladding Jackson did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7451)|
| 2:04:17| I remember during that planning process, your firm, what was then your firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7457)|
| 2:04:22| I know you're retired now, but ran a fairly complex, maybe not complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7462)|
| 2:04:30| but a fairly sophisticated computer model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7470)|
| 2:04:33| modeling what would happen to traffic flows on Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7473)|
| 2:04:38| and I think it addressed movement or ingress-egress off the adjacent streets, did it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7478)|
| 2:04:44| Yes, it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7484)|
| 2:04:45| And the decision to create, to go with the three-lane cross-section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7485)|
| 2:04:50| was there a lot of concerns, is that going to work better or going to work worse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7490)|
| 2:04:53| That was based on the entire model and it functioning correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7493)|
| 2:04:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7496)|
| 2:05:00| You may have a different fix on this than I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7500)|
| 2:05:03| but when I heard about the proposed closure of 19th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7503)|
| 2:05:07| and also the possibility that there may be a request at some point to close 21st Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7507)|
| 2:05:13| that apparently was started and then stopped and that may or may not come back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7513)|
| 2:05:19| Would it make sense in your mind to reactivate that model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7519)|
| 2:05:25| And I know you're not at the firm anymore, but to reactivate that model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7525)|
| 2:05:29| or whether Gladding Jackson did it or someone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7529)|
| 2:05:32| and model that again with 19th Street closed and perhaps also with 19th and 21st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7532)|
| 2:05:38| so we could get an idea whether 21st, whether that request ever comes back to us or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7538)|
| 2:05:43| going back to your slippery slope concern statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7543)|
| 2:05:48| so we could have an idea of what the impacts might be on Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7548)|
| 2:05:53| with using that model and what future ramifications might be with more closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7553)|
| 2:05:58| It would make every bit of sense to look at it with an updated version of that model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7558)|
| 2:06:02| The reason I didn't mention it is just a reluctance on the part of a consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7562)|
| 2:06:07| to say that more consulting work is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| It would be a very good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7569)|
| 2:06:11| The reason being is that the success of the Cumberland Avenue downsizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7571)|
| 2:06:18| depended very greatly on a very balanced, even flow of the side streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7578)|
| 2:06:24| such that we were able to have small amounts of green time at the signals from the side street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7584)|
| 2:06:30| delivering all the cross street traffic and not concentrating traffic at any of the side streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7590)|
| 2:06:36| resulting in a large green time and thereby a bottleneck on Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7596)|
| 2:06:41| The closure of one or two of the streets, of course, is going to do just the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7601)|
| 2:06:46| It will throw traffic onto the remaining intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7606)|
| 2:06:50| For that reason, it should be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| The model that was used is the standard travel demand forecast model that is not proprietary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7612)|
| 2:07:02| so any number of practitioners and possibly even the MPO would be capable of using it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7622)|
| 2:07:10| and getting the conclusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7633)|
| 2:07:14| Thank you for the answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7634)|
| 2:07:20| Given the nature of what we anticipate in terms of development on Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7640)|
| 2:07:27| with much greater density, I think we just have some rough estimates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7647)|
| 2:07:32| and I don't remember them off the top of my head in terms of the residential potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| because we're looking at a mixed-use district with multi-story buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7655)|
| 2:07:39| perhaps up to six-story buildings along the entire corridor from 17th to potentially all the way to Volunteer Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7659)|
| 2:07:47| at least on one side, over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7667)|
| 2:07:50| Of course, again, we're talking over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7670)|
| 2:07:54| As one of the speakers said earlier, we need to think long-term in terms of the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7674)|
| 2:08:01| because once the street goes away, it goes away forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7681)|
| 2:08:06| If we have perhaps a couple thousand people, I don't know what the numbers are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7686)|
| 2:08:12| living on Cumberland and moving in and out, probably more towards the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7692)|
| 2:08:19| but moving in different directions at different times, a plethora of new businesses, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7699)|
| 2:08:25| I mean, that's really what we're hoping for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| And increased density in areas that still have development opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7707)|
| 2:08:32| like Grand Avenue immediately west of 17th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7712)|
| 2:08:36| In addition to all the density, I think we're talking maybe the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7716)|
| 2:08:40| or certainly one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in all of the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7720)|
| 2:08:44| somewhere between 15,000 and 16,000 people in the entire neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7724)|
| 2:08:48| So where I'm going with this is if you've got not only what we've got now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7728)|
| 2:08:53| but we're anticipating more development, some more development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7733)|
| 2:08:56| but not a tremendous amount on the north end on Grand, but also maybe hundreds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7736)|
| 2:09:04| maybe 1,000, probably less, and then new development with a lot more people on Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7744)|
| 2:09:10| Was that taken into account in the model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7750)|
| 2:09:13| I assume that it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| Perhaps you can reflect that easily in the model, and we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7755)|
| 2:09:18| Bear in mind that the traffic study that was done looked at a fairly short-range view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7758)|
| 2:09:25| accurate for the year that it was being discussed, but short-range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7765)|
| 2:09:30| A lot of the hoped-for impacts of Cumberland Avenue revitalization are long-range in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7770)|
| 2:09:36| They are not going to happen within five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7776)|
| 2:09:38| And then further revitalization of the neighborhood that we've heard about earlier this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7778)|
| 2:09:43| or intensification of the density in the northern part of the neighborhood, that's longer-range too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7783)|
| 2:09:47| So that should all be folded into this kind of revisiting the study that we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7787)|
| 2:09:54| How would one go about addressing those longer-range impacts and concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7794)|
| 2:09:59| and projecting out further, and how would that be done or addressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7799)|
| 2:10:05| Ideally through the small area planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7805)|
| 2:10:09| in which spokesmen for the neighborhood and for the entities, including the hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7809)|
| 2:10:17| come in with not only their short-range outlook, but even the longer-range ones beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7817)|
| 2:10:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7827)|
| 2:10:28| I know my understanding of the medical industry, which is very limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7828)|
| 2:10:31| is that some of that they have to be very close with and proprietary about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7831)|
| 2:10:36| because of the competitive nature and certificates of need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| that they have to get from the regulators and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| So that may be a problem, but it certainly makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7842)|
| 2:10:48| I think we're losing council members, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7848)|
| 2:10:53| Mr. Brown had to step out for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7853)|
| 2:10:56| So, yes, Mr. Labate, did you want to make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7856)|
| 2:11:00| I did want to clarify one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7860)|
| 2:11:02| We have the Gladden-Jackson traffic model, and we've been using that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7862)|
| 2:11:08| As a matter of fact, it's been part of our analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7868)|
| 2:11:11| It's not been the primary focus, but our study area is limited to 17th Street down to 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7871)|
| 2:11:19| But we have their model, and we've been using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7879)|
| 2:11:23| In fact, our analysis includes the road diet in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7883)|
| 2:11:29| I can't speak to all the other intersections along Cumberland Avenue beyond 17th Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7889)|
| 2:11:35| but I do know that the traffic impact is fairly minimal beyond 17th Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7895)|
| 2:11:43| as a result of the closure of 19th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7903)|
| 2:11:46| So we have the model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7906)|
| 2:11:47| We've been using it, and it's very effective in analyzing the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7907)|
| 2:11:56| If you look at the Cumberland Avenue plan, in that plan are the numbers generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7916)|
| 2:12:02| and under certain conditions by the model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| and they're sort of laid out on the plan for different intersections and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| Can you reproduce that with the street closures then with that model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7927)|
| 2:12:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7932)|
| 2:12:13| The revised numbers projected over time with the growth on Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7933)|
| 2:12:17| all the variables we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| I mean, I know you can't address the universe of variables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7939)|
| 2:12:22| but at least some reasonable projections into the future based on what we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7942)|
| 2:12:26| with Cumberland Avenue development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7946)|
| 2:12:29| Yeah, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7949)|
| 2:12:30| Now, as the other speaker said, that has not been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7950)|
| 2:12:36| We've been looking at a short-range condition five years in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7956)|
| 2:12:42| but I do think we've taken a very optimistic viewpoint of development in the area given the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7962)|
| 2:12:49| So we feel fairly comfortable within the next five years that we're fairly accurate in our projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7969)|
| 2:12:56| Beyond that, it's very speculative depending on what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7976)|
| 2:13:01| and very difficult to project traffic beyond that with some reasonable degree of certainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7981)|
| 2:13:08| I understand, but it seems to me there might be some value given that we know roughly where we want to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7988)|
| 2:13:16| with Cumberland Avenue development, and we might come up with a reasonable ballpark of numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=7996)|
| 2:13:24| in terms of people, residents, et cetera, and do a little bit of scenario kind of projection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8004)|
| 2:13:32| scenario planning and say, okay, we don't know, but let's just look at some options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8012)|
| 2:13:36| kind of best and worst case or minimum, maximum, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8016)|
| 2:13:41| And, again, those may not even end up being the maximum or the minimum that might actually occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8021)|
| 2:13:46| but it seems to me like there would be some value projecting beyond five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8026)|
| 2:13:50| because, as Mr. Kulash said, Cumberland's not going to develop out in five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8030)|
| 2:13:55| nor will any of the area on Grand Avenue may or may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8035)|
| 2:14:00| But do you see difficulty in doing something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8040)|
| 2:14:05| Just say we could agree on some rough numbers and see where that scenario takes us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8045)|
| 2:14:12| Sure, sure, you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8052)|
| 2:14:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8054)|
| 2:14:15| Well, I think that would be good if we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| Thank you, Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8057)|
| 2:14:18| I think Ms. Wallace has a comment she'd like to make if you concluded yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8058)|
| 2:14:23| Yeah, one other thing I wanted to just go back and mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8063)|
| 2:14:27| The calculations on user cost as a result of the closure of 19th Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8067)|
| 2:14:32| are all based on my guess as to what percent of the traffic is hospital versus is not hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8072)|
| 2:14:41| We try to take a very conservative approach to the amount of traffic that would be diverted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8081)|
| 2:14:46| And, in actuality, there are other roads and other options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8086)|
| 2:14:52| and you would hope that motorists would plan their trip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8092)|
| 2:14:56| and realize that there are other roads that they can take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| and so it would not result in any additional travel, just a different road that they're traveling on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8099)|
| 2:15:04| So just that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8104)|
| 2:15:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8110)|
| 2:15:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| We have next on the agenda Kathy Irwin about neighborhood impacts, but someone said of Ms. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8113)|
| 2:15:19| Ms. Wallace wanted to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8119)|
| 2:15:21| Well, I had a question, a follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| It's a follow-up with what Councilman Holquist said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| I had a follow-up question for Mr. Kulash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8125)|
| 2:15:28| Did you have a question for Ms. Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8128)|
| 2:15:30| I did not have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8130)|
| 2:15:31| I had a request from the staff that Ms. Wallace had a comment she wanted to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8131)|
| 2:15:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8136)|
| 2:15:38| I'll hold on that and then go back to Mr. Kulash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8138)|
| 2:15:40| You don't have to go to the podium since you've got a microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8140)|
| 2:15:43| Let's let her go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8143)|
| 2:15:45| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8145)|
| 2:15:46| I just wanted to let you all know that as part of the scope of services that we have outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8146)|
| 2:15:51| for the Cumberland Avenue detailed design work that's actually before Council on Tuesday evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8151)|
| 2:15:56| we have contracted or are anticipating contracting for a detailed traffic impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8156)|
| 2:16:02| and that's with the consultants that have been recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8162)|
| 2:16:06| that being Vaughn and Melton, to the City Council for contracting for the Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8166)|
| 2:16:12| detailed design work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8172)|
| 2:16:13| In addition to that, we've also contracted with Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8173)|
| 2:16:17| the TPO staff, to do an additional traffic circulation study that's looking at traffic calming measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8177)|
| 2:16:24| that might need to be taken for the benefit of the neighborhood as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8184)|
| 2:16:29| So we do have, as staff, we have two options that are immediately before us to look at long-range impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8189)|
| 2:16:35| and to proceed with the traffic planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8195)|
| 2:16:38| And in addition to that, partnering with whatever agreement can be worked out for long-range planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8198)|
| 2:16:44| for the neighborhood, those considerations have been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8204)|
| 2:16:47| and we'll be moving forward as per the consultant selection and also with the TPO staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8207)|
| 2:16:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8217)|
| 2:16:58| That's very encouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8218)|
| 2:16:59| I'm glad to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| Mr. Kulash, again, there are tremendous numbers of residents, students primarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8221)|
| 2:17:11| that live in the Fort Sanders neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| in this western part of the Fort Sanders neighborhood specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8234)|
| 2:17:17| and it seems to me like a significant amount of their mobility or movement is north-south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8237)|
| 2:17:23| One of the things that we've encountered in the past, a problem, is students, anytime they're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8243)|
| 2:17:30| and of course I can pretend I never did this, I did it too, except I never lived in Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8250)|
| 2:17:36| but sometimes students run late for class and they party late, sleep late, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8256)|
| 2:17:43| They're running late for class and they'll jump in their car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8263)|
| 2:17:47| Now that's getting increasingly problematic because it's harder and harder to find parking on the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8267)|
| 2:17:54| There are far more parking permits, as a matter of fact, student parking permits, than there are spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8274)|
| 2:18:00| They call a student parking permit a license to hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8280)|
| 2:18:04| But given the fact that we're looking at a high percentage probably of north-south movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8284)|
| 2:18:16| from the residential area in Fort Sanders to the campus and the university facilities on the campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8296)|
| 2:18:22| and back, sometimes multiple times per day, if there are not direct routes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8302)|
| 2:18:30| and we're hoping to have those students as often as possible walk or bicycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8310)|
| 2:18:36| if they're faced with a more circuitous route that makes it less convenient to walk or bicycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8316)|
| 2:18:44| that takes more time, based on your experience in similar environments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8324)|
| 2:18:50| what do you see is the impact of a single street closure and perhaps even more importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8330)|
| 2:18:57| the collective impacts of multiple street closures over time on that kind of condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8337)|
| 2:19:04| Undoubtedly negative impacts, and that's why we are so opposed to starting off this whole slippery slope process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8344)|
| 2:19:15| of street closings. Only two things can happen with the traffic when you close a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8355)|
| 2:19:23| Number one is some or all of the travelers persist in trying to go the way they did before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8363)|
| 2:19:32| and they encounter the closed street, so now you're into turning movements that weren't there before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8372)|
| 2:19:40| in this case turning movements in high pedestrian areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8380)|
| 2:19:43| and additional miles of travel also in the vicinity of the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8383)|
| 2:19:47| because they can't go the way they wanted to before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8387)|
| 2:19:52| If, as Hollis Loveday said earlier, you would hope that people would learn the new system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8392)|
| 2:19:58| then this is the other thing that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8398)|
| 2:20:00| They learn the new system and they all concentrate on the remaining street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8400)|
| 2:20:04| in which case we now have great imbalance at the places where it really matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8404)|
| 2:20:10| which is where our streets connect with the arterials, where our small streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8410)|
| 2:20:14| such as 19th and 20th, connect with the arterials, such as Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8414)|
| 2:20:20| So it's a no-win situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8420)|
| 2:20:23| We either create more miles of travel and turning movements and inflict this cost on the drivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8423)|
| 2:20:30| and inflict the results of their additional travel and impatience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8430)|
| 2:20:35| and maybe even frustration and anger on the pedestrians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8435)|
| 2:20:39| or they learn the system and they learn that you can't go that way anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8439)|
| 2:20:46| and then they start overusing what's going to be the few remaining streets left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8446)|
| 2:20:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8453)|
| 2:20:54| Okay, but you're still talking about vehicular travel, motorized vehicular travel primarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8454)|
| 2:21:00| not pedestrian or bicycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8460)|
| 2:21:04| No, although pedestrian and bicycle travel, of course, is subject to the same issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8464)|
| 2:21:10| about it either has to, until it learns the new system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8470)|
| 2:21:18| encounters additional travel or they're not able to use the route of their choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8478)|
| 2:21:25| which might have been 19th, because it was a street that was hindered by hospital operations and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8485)|
| 2:21:32| and therefore made a better lower speed sort of traffic calm street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8492)|
| 2:21:37| So, again, there's no way you can take away pieces of network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8497)|
| 2:21:42| and have it be anything but a disbenefit to non-motorized travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8502)|
| 2:21:47| I understand what I'm after here, too, and that all makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8507)|
| 2:21:51| Also is some sense of do we have any idea in terms of people making modal choices on a short-term basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8511)|
| 2:22:00| You know, they get up in the morning, they've got to decide how they're going to get to class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8520)|
| 2:22:04| If it becomes more difficult and more circuitous to walk or bicycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8524)|
| 2:22:10| I'm just wondering if you've seen that happen, if you're aware of any studies, or if you're not, that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8530)|
| 2:22:16| but I'm just fishing here to find out if we have any good data about how people's behavior changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8536)|
| 2:22:23| based on whether or not they've got a good straight shot to walk or bicycle or whether or not they.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8543)|
| 2:22:30| No, we are more likely to just go on the principle that the shortest walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8550)|
| 2:22:36| the shortest distance is a straight line between two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8556)|
| 2:22:40| The nicer that distance is, the more attractive it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8560)|
| 2:22:43| the more likely it will be used for walking or non-motorized travel instead of driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8563)|
| 2:22:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8572)|
| 2:22:54| Kathy Irwin, regarding neighborhood impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8574)|
| 2:23:01| Thank you, and I appreciate your patience waiting all this long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8581)|
| 2:23:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| We will be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8586)|
| 2:23:07| My neighbors have prepared a statement that they wish me to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8587)|
| 2:23:10| and we want to say first thank you for the opportunity to speak this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8590)|
| 2:23:15| The historic Fort Sanders Neighborhood Association wants what is best for our neighborhood and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8595)|
| 2:23:20| We respectfully ask that you, our city council, seize this current opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8600)|
| 2:23:25| to utilize the planning tools at the city's disposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8605)|
| 2:23:28| to strengthen the historic Fort Sanders neighborhood for all the stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8608)|
| 2:23:33| Regardless of this block of 19th Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8613)|
| 2:23:35| we know that working in conjunction with Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8615)|
| 2:23:40| as well as the other stakeholders, to build a better, stronger, safer Fort Sanders neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8620)|
| 2:23:45| will ultimately be best for what is best for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8625)|
| 2:23:49| but particularly the medical center's campus within our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8629)|
| 2:23:53| The historic Fort Sanders neighborhood wishes to be an inclusive partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8633)|
| 2:23:57| in planning efforts for our neighborhood's future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8637)|
| 2:24:00| As Mr. DeFord previously mentioned, we've already taken a proactive approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8640)|
| 2:24:04| by filing papers to create a citizen-led community development corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8644)|
| 2:24:08| in order that we might help strengthen our own community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8648)|
| 2:24:11| and we ask for your help in this endeavor as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8651)|
| 2:24:14| We know that a healthy and strong neighborhood is one with a future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8654)|
| 2:24:18| and that all stakeholders have an all-for-one and a one-for-all attitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8658)|
| 2:24:23| The major question for our neighborhood association is the impact of this road closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8663)|
| 2:24:28| Our conclusion at this point is that we just don't know what the longer-term impact is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8668)|
| 2:24:34| The issue is not just this one project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8674)|
| 2:24:37| It is the complex interaction of several interdependent projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8677)|
| 2:24:41| We've been working proactively with the city, the hospital, the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8681)|
| 2:24:46| and the local merchants on the Cumberland Avenue corridor project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8686)|
| 2:24:49| and we are thrilled at the prospects of over $12 million of investment in revitalizing the strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8689)|
| 2:24:55| That plan envisions and encourages an increase in density of three to four times over existing usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8695)|
| 2:25:02| But the details of that plan and the impact on local streets are still being discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8702)|
| 2:25:08| and won't be finalized for several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| So in conclusion, as we deliberate this closure of 19th Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8711)|
| 2:25:15| the Historic Fort Sanders Neighborhood Association requests an end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8715)|
| 2:25:18| to the piecemeal approach to planning for our neighborhood's future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8718)|
| 2:25:22| Please look at our neighborhood comprehensively and direct city resources towards that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8722)|
| 2:25:27| Both the north and the south sides of our neighborhood are the focus of major city planning efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8727)|
| 2:25:32| investment, and redevelopment, including the Cumberland Avenue corridor and the I-4275 corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8732)|
| 2:25:39| We are the next logical piece to that puzzle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8739)|
| 2:25:42| which will only further our city's livability through connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8742)|
| 2:25:46| Thanks again for the opportunity to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8746)|
| 2:25:48| and we welcome any questions or comments that you may have for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8748)|
| 2:25:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8752)|
| 2:25:53| And if you'd like to provide a copy of that to Ms. Wilson here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8753)|
| 2:25:55| she'll make sure that it's made a part of the record and we're all provided copies of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8755)|
| 2:26:00| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8760)|
| 2:26:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8762)|
| 2:26:03| At this juncture, the chair would make an observation that by unanimous consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8763)|
| 2:26:09| we'll add public forum to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8769)|
| 2:26:11| I know there are some people here from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8771)|
| 2:26:13| I don't know if we had anyone sign in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8773)|
| 2:26:15| but is there anyone from the public here with us today who wishes to be heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8775)|
| 2:26:20| Yes, please come forward, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8780)|
| 2:26:33| Good to see you again, Mr. Blitner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| The time is 7.31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8797)|
| 2:26:38| Give us your name and address, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8798)|
| 2:26:39| Jim Blitner, 3819 Glenfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8799)|
| 2:26:43| I've got a couple of quick questions I'd like to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| and make sure that I understand everything, and then a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8805)|
| 2:26:51| One, my understanding is that the Clinch entrance to the yard will be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8811)|
| 2:26:56| It will only be back through the Laurel Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8816)|
| 2:26:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8821)|
| 2:27:02| The other question that I have is the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8822)|
| 2:27:03| The answer to that was yes, so we may have heard that in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8823)|
| 2:27:06| The other question that I had was, Mr. Loveday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8826)|
| 2:27:09| was the dates that his traffic study was done, the dates that your study was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8829)|
| 2:27:18| In the original study, the data were collected in February of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8838)|
| 2:27:23| when Knox County Schools and UT was in session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8843)|
| 2:27:26| The follow-up study, the data were collected in the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8846)|
| 2:27:30| so we adjusted those counts to reflect a peak season with UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8850)|
| 2:27:36| and Knox County in session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8856)|
| 2:27:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8862)|
| 2:27:43| I was curious of the dates because having studied the traffic counts on Kingston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8863)|
| 2:27:46| PICA can tell you that they fluctuate greatly by the month and the day of the week, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8866)|
| 2:27:51| So I was curious what those studies reflected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8871)|
| 2:27:55| Let me say that I have 50 years' experience in this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8875)|
| 2:27:58| as well as several other individuals that are here who went to school there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8878)|
| 2:28:01| or lived there or grew up in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8881)|
| 2:28:04| I've lived or worked there for over 50 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| so I have a vested interest, I think, in what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8886)|
| 2:28:10| I would make this comment for our architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8890)|
| 2:28:13| I think what you need to provide counsel is a cross-section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8893)|
| 2:28:18| which shows the different elevations with your current facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8898)|
| 2:28:22| your proposed facility, and your street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8902)|
| 2:28:24| I found it very difficult to follow your presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8904)|
| 2:28:27| and I think that that would be very helpful so that they can totally understand your problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8907)|
| 2:28:33| And that also may be helpful in finding if there are alternative solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8913)|
| 2:28:37| that would allow some other people to make suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| I think all of us want to see a facility move forward that would be a great benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8921)|
| 2:28:46| to the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| I also think that the neighborhood has a lot of valid points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8929)|
| 2:28:52| in the fact that they don't want 19th closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8932)|
| 2:28:55| As I said, I've lived there for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8935)|
| 2:28:57| I can tell you that, you know, we talked about traffic delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8937)|
| 2:29:01| We know they're going to be worse if 19th is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8941)|
| 2:29:04| That's without question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8944)|
| 2:29:06| If you've ever tried to come out of 20th or 21st Street in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8946)|
| 2:29:12| there are certain times it's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8952)|
| 2:29:16| There are other times it's darn near impossible if you're going to turn across traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8956)|
| 2:29:20| So I do think there is a lot more room for traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8960)|
| 2:29:23| and I think it does need to be done so that you totally understand the impacts of what will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8963)|
| 2:29:29| By the way, I did earn part of my way through college by running the computers for Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8969)|
| 2:29:36| and that was a good experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8976)|
| 2:29:38| It's grown quite a bit since then, and I know that they have done so with some growing pains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8978)|
| 2:29:45| But what I would like to see happen is that you guys don't jump into any quick decisions on this one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8985)|
| 2:29:53| I think that more study is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8993)|
| 2:29:55| I think you need to get the results of these traffic studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8995)|
| 2:29:58| and I think these elevations are important so that you have the actual in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=8998)|
| 2:30:04| You have that cross section in front of you so you can determine for yourselves what is viable and what not is viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9004)|
| 2:30:11| I like the ideas of the traffic calming in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9011)|
| 2:30:13| If 19th stayed open, I think it's a very practical approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9013)|
| 2:30:17| and it might be an approach that might work for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9017)|
| 2:30:20| I do, in the future, think that it's very conceivable that they would go back with their approach of perhaps closing 21st Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9020)|
| 2:30:29| because I think that that's a natural progression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9029)|
| 2:30:32| If they are successful in doing what they would like to do on 19th, I think it might make some sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9032)|
| 2:30:38| And then I think you have to consider Children's Hospital that hopefully will still continue to grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9038)|
| 2:30:43| and be the asset to Knoxville that it has been, and is in very close proximity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9043)|
| 2:30:49| Thank you for your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9049)|
| 2:30:51| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9051)|
| 2:30:53| Anyone else from the public who wish to be heard on public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9053)|
| 2:30:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9057)|
| 2:30:58| If you'll come forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9058)|
| 2:31:00| Time is 7.35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9060)|
| 2:31:02| Let us have your name and address, and you have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9062)|
| 2:31:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9066)|
| 2:31:07| My name is John Haas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9067)|
| 2:31:08| I live at 2215 Highland Avenue, which is on the west end of Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9068)|
| 2:31:13| I've been in this neighborhood since 1992.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9073)|
| 2:31:15| I came to school here then and studied architecture and graduated architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9075)|
| 2:31:19| I now teach architecture at the university, and I've actually canceled my class today to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9079)|
| 2:31:25| I've been to Fort Sanders Regional three different times, in the ER, injuring myself working on houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9085)|
| 2:31:32| some recreational stuff, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9092)|
| 2:31:34| I skateboard and bike, and I've hurt myself and been in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9094)|
| 2:31:37| I've also had two children at Fort Sanders, and I have one more on the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9097)|
| 2:31:41| and we will have my child at Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9101)|
| 2:31:44| My wife makes it a point to walk home from the center there when we have our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9104)|
| 2:31:51| Fort Sanders Hospital is an important part of our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9111)|
| 2:31:55| but I just wanted to bring up a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9115)|
| 2:31:57| Obviously, 19th is one of the only streets, and I know we've gone over this multiple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9117)|
| 2:32:02| and there's been experts speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9122)|
| 2:32:03| It's one of the only streets that has a stop sign at the end of it at Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9123)|
| 2:32:07| It's also one of the only two-way streets on the west end of 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9127)|
| 2:32:11| There's 17th, 19th, and 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9131)|
| 2:32:13| I travel 19th every day, multiple times every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9133)|
| 2:32:17| I have 14 properties in Fort Sanders and one on Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9137)|
| 2:32:23| and I go between them all multiple times every day fixing things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9143)|
| 2:32:27| or just going to them, checking up on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9147)|
| 2:32:31| As far as the architecture goes, I studied architecture, practiced it for a while, teach it currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9151)|
| 2:32:37| and I think the architects have taken an easy way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9157)|
| 2:32:40| They've asked for as much as they can in the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9160)|
| 2:32:46| and I would assume they would be prepared for a no answer on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9166)|
| 2:32:51| At least I would hope they would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9171)|
| 2:32:53| One of my suggestions would be, just like Children's Hospital has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9173)|
| 2:32:56| they have an overpass that goes above the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9176)|
| 2:32:59| I think that would be a wonderful solution here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9179)|
| 2:33:01| You still get traffic, you still get pedestrian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9181)|
| 2:33:04| and I think it could be really the entrance to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9184)|
| 2:33:07| You could have a huge sign on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9187)|
| 2:33:08| You could have an emergency room with a red arrow pointing straight down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9188)|
| 2:33:11| It makes it easy for everybody to find,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9191)|
| 2:33:13| and possibly even open it up for a nice cafe or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9193)|
| 2:33:18| Make it a really pronounced part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9198)|
| 2:33:20| On the drawings, it only looks like it's 30 or 40 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9200)|
| 2:33:23| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9203)|
| 2:33:24| As far as the overpass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9204)|
| 2:33:26| About 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9206)|
| 2:33:29| It doesn't even come close to utilizing all of the space over 19th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9209)|
| 2:33:34| If it goes over, I wouldn't think that many of the citizens would mind that it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9214)|
| 2:33:40| So there's a possibility right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9220)|
| 2:33:43| The other possibility, of course, is like other people said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9223)|
| 2:33:45| the ER does have a specific life to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9225)|
| 2:33:48| It's not going to be viable to keep that particular ER there very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9228)|
| 2:33:53| It's going to have to be renovated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| If you're building a building right next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9235)|
| 2:33:56| this might be the perfect time to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9236)|
| 2:33:58| and to provide access directly to that ER and have a brand-new facility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9238)|
| 2:34:04| I'm sure they've looked into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9244)|
| 2:34:09| I guess my other question is, in all of the—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9249)|
| 2:34:14| I might shoot myself in the foot here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9254)|
| 2:34:18| I have not seen any other project that has closed a city street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9258)|
| 2:34:25| in a neighborhood this old and this established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9265)|
| 2:34:28| That grid is over 150 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9268)|
| 2:34:30| and they're asking to close a section of it to, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9270)|
| 2:34:35| help them out of certain situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9275)|
| 2:34:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9278)|
| 2:34:39| Out of all the hospitals you've designed, have you ever closed a city street and built on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9279)|
| 2:34:43| We're doing it right now in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9283)|
| 2:34:45| We're doing it right now in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9285)|
| 2:34:46| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9286)|
| 2:34:48| Anyway, the thing I'd like to ask the Council is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9288)|
| 2:34:53| if this was in your neighborhood, if this was in Forth and Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9293)|
| 2:34:57| or if this was in Sequoia, or if this was in any other neighborhood that you guys represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9297)|
| 2:35:02| would you want this to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9302)|
| 2:35:03| Would you want one of your streets, one of your main streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9303)|
| 2:35:07| that connects a whole lot of people, a whole lot of residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9307)|
| 2:35:12| to where they need to go to be closed for one organization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9312)|
| 2:35:17| And I believe that's all I need to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9317)|
| 2:35:21| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9321)|
| 2:35:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9323)|
| 2:35:25| Anyone else wish to be heard on public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9325)|
| 2:35:30| Seeing no further lights from Council, seeing no one else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9330)|
| 2:35:33| we appreciate everyone's attendance and patience here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9333)|
| 2:35:36| We look forward to our continuing discussion on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop080918?start=9336)|
