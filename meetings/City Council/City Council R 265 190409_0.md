| 0:03:01| Okay, now before we move on, there is one person who Councilwoman Singh-Perez would like to ask to come speak briefly about Metro Drug Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=181)|
| 0:03:11| So, Jason Goodman, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| Thank you for coming, and please come to the podium, and please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| And if you watch the timer above me, that should pop up at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=201)|
| 0:03:27| Then you'll have up to five minutes, and we appreciate what you do, and we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| Thank you. My name is Jason Goodman. My address is 829 Lester Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=212)|
| 0:03:40| First of all, thank you for everything that you do, Mayor, and officials here tonight for our city, for the greater Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=220)|
| 0:03:47| At MDC, our mission is very clear. We are driven to reduce substance misuse in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=227)|
| 0:03:56| My job through MDC is I'm a lifeline coordinator, so I cover Knox County and 16 surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=236)|
| 0:04:04| And one of the barriers that we see to the recovery process is one of the most important things for somebody to begin out their recovery walk is to have somewhere to reside safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=244)|
| 0:04:13| So this proposal that we put in from MDC was to ask for a continuation of a fund we've created there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=253)|
| 0:04:21| Our second annual recovery resource fair this year, this past year in 2018, we did something we hadn't done the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=261)|
| 0:04:28| We charged booth rental for the 50 vendors, and we took on sponsorship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| And the idea was to create this very fund to help pay deposits into sober living for those who were coming out of jail, leaving treatment, coming out of detox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=272)|
| 0:04:41| or just in the beginning stages of the recovery process, whatever that looked like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| So we took $4,555.42, and we created that fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| And that changed the course of 16 people's lives in a very short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| The majority, a large percentage of those referrals came from Judge Cerny's recovery court here because they were in that process there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=297)|
| 0:05:04| but they did not have a way to get into sober living, halfway recovery housing to keep them safe while they were in their process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=304)|
| 0:05:12| So the bulk of the referrals came from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| The very first person that we worked with, this is something that I really wanted to state and Sima and I had talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| The very first woman that we dealt with in this process with this fund was facing two years in prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| And she was a first-time offender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| Her three kids were living with her mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| They had no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| All she needed was a safe place to start and an approval from the judge to say this is where she's going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| She didn't have insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| She was incarcerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Mom didn't have any money to help with any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| And $300 completely and totally changed the course of this woman's life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| So as little as $300 started her process, kept her from going on into the prison system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| and she now has visitation with those kids and with her mother, and her process is still going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| So that's what we're looking to do with these funds, continue to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| and we just want to say thank you for the support that you've always given MDC and us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| and for the people that are in recovery in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| This is a thriving mecca for treatment and recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| We're doing a lot of things really good here, and we've just identified gaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| and we want to continue to work in those areas and keep doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| So I think I came in under my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| Thank you very much for having me here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| I appreciate it very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| Thank you, Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| And please tell Karen Pershing and all the staff we appreciate so much what Metro Drug Coalition does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=385)|
| 0:06:31| You are really the core for all of us who are working on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| We depend on MDC to coordinate us, bring us all together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| and help us work together to do the best we can to serve this population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| Yes, ma'am, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| Okay, so we'll move on to the mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| I'm pleased to announce that my annual State of the City address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| and presentation of my proposed 2019-20 budget will be held on Friday, April 26th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=414)|
| 0:07:03| at the site of the soon-to-be-constructed Urban Wilderness Gateway Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| The luncheon will start at noon on April 26th at the terminus of the James White Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| which is the point where it currently dead-ends basically at Sevierville Pike right at the Moody exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=433)|
| 0:07:20| But I have to give you some instructions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| Parking is very limited right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| It's the end of the parkway before you exit to head off to Moody or Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| So we need guests to park at the Knoxville Civic Auditorium and Coliseum Garages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| and we will have shuttle buses there that will take you from the garage to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| The buses will start rolling at 11 a.m., so we encourage you not to wait until 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| but to come early and get there, and you can look around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| There will be a lot of information out there about the proposed gateway park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| A lot of design, a lot of planning have gone into this already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| and you can learn about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| Members of the AMBC, Appalachian Mountain Bike Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| and others will be there to talk to you about the urban wilderness and the gateway park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| So the parking in the shuttle will be free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| We will provide brown bag lunches to guests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| and we're encouraging you to wear comfortable shoes because it's still a rough site there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| Everyone is welcome to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| We encourage the public to come, but we ask that you RSVP by calling 311 by April 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=502)|
| 0:08:29| That's a week before the actual luncheon, so we can order enough brown bag lunches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=509)|
| 0:08:36| Or you can dial the full number, which is 865-215-4311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| We need a good head count so we can get the right amount of food and water and seating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| There will also be accessible parking at the garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| The communications and special events team will be getting the word out on all the logistical details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| and you can also visit knoxvilletn.gov slash news to get more details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=536)|
| 0:09:02| I'm really excited about this venue, the urban wilderness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| which I think most of you know is more than 1,000 acres of forested land south of the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=546)|
| 0:09:13| It's an amazing natural, recreational, economic, and cultural resource for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| And this spring, we will begin construction on the Gateway Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| The money is in the budget for the current year, as Council approved last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| and this will serve as a stepping-off point for anyone wanting to explore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| and discover all that's in the urban wilderness on this end of the world, urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| This will be my eighth and final budget to present to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| So, again, I hope everyone will join us on Friday, April 26, lunch starting at 12 noon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| park at the Coliseum garages, ride the shuttles, all for free, and you can start doing that at 11 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=585)|
| 0:09:52| Wear comfortable shoes, and please RSVP by calling 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| A few other things to note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| Tomorrow morning, I'll be at McGee-Tyson Airport to join in the send-off of more than 130 veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| who will be part of Honor Air Knoxville's Flight 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=604)|

| 0:10:29| Honor Air, of course, does a terrific job in honoring our service men and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=629)|

| 0:10:40| I know a lot of Council members come to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=640)|

| 0:18:35| and it's not that I have any objection to the mayor's position getting fair compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| for a job that can be 24 hours a day demanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1120)|
| 0:18:46| What my issue was is that so many people in Knoxville work so hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| and do not get a fair compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| So I'm hoping that maybe this can begin us having conversations about a fair wage when city funds are involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1134)|
| 0:19:03| I know that through the state there are limitations to what we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| but I think getting that intention out there is probably the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| As I said two weeks ago, I'm not going to vote on this since I'm seeking this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| And just, again, for the record, this is for the incoming mayor, not for the current one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| So any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| There was considerable discussion two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1177)|

| 0:19:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| So we have, again, six ayes, two noes, and one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1185)|

| 0:19:54| I thought, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Maybe I looked at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| It's my usual position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Seven to one to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| 11A as a resolution expressing support of the Chapman Highway Safety Improvements as prioritized in the Improve Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1205)|
| 0:20:12| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| Mayor, can I add myself as a co-sponsor on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| Are there any other council members that would like to sign on as sponsors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| Just raise your hand if you'd like to be a sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| Actually, it looks like everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| So it'll go on record as all council members being sponsors of this resolution expressing support for the Chapman Highway Safety Improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1229)|
| 0:20:37| which Councilman Welch has already referred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| 11B as a resolution honoring and congratulating the Bearden High School boys basketball team upon the occasion of its first state championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1249)|
| 0:20:58| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| This resolution recognizes the hard work and dedication of the Bearden High School boys basketball team in this historic season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1262)|
| 0:21:09| The team won 32 games out of 37, and after defeating the three-time defending state champions Memphis East by a score of 83 to 68,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1269)|
| 0:21:19| they brought home the first AAA state championship to Knoxville since 1977.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1279)|
| 0:21:26| So I think all of council just wants to congratulate the Bearden Bulldogs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| and I'd like to invite Coach Parrott to come to the podium if he wanted to tell us a little bit about this team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1291)|
| 0:21:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| I wasn't prepared to speak, but as my guys will tell you, that won't keep me from talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| Thank you to the councilmen and women of Knoxville, the city council, for recognizing this accomplishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| It's been a long time, and it's a large classification state title that we had to go through Metro Memphis to earn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| This team has superlatives, you know, just all kinds of great accomplishments, scholarships, accolades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1323)|
| 0:22:12| This has been three years in the making, but none of those would even come close to the recognition they have received as a team and winning a state title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1332)|
| 0:22:22| So, again, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| I'm honored to be their coach, and we look for more great things to come out of Bearden basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Team, do you want to stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| Yeah, let's have them stand up, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1353)|
| 0:22:51| Thank you, coach, and thank you, team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| Are you finished, councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1381)|

| 0:23:04| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| Bye-bye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| They're leaving pretty fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| They saw this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1392)|
| 0:23:18| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents to convey property, including a quit-claim deed, to Thomas Wade Sheehan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1398)|

| 0:23:34| pursuant to the homemaker's program for a contract sales price of $50,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| Thank you, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| I'm going to ask Becky Wade to come up and explain a little bit of the math of how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| You did a good job of getting back a lot of the money that we had to spend on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| and I appreciate you doing that and just kind of talk us through that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Becky Wade, director of community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| This was a blighted, vacant property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| It's a home located in south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| It was certified as blighted by the Better Building Board, and so we took steps to acquire it from the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1451)|
| 0:24:20| We paid a little over $53,000 for it, but a large chunk of that money paid the city back in back taxes and codes liens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1460)|
| 0:24:31| So about $30,000, a little over $30,000 went to pay back taxes to the city in the amount of $22,000 and about $7,400 to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1471)|
| 0:24:44| And so the remainder of the sales price that went to the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| We listed it for sale and homemakers had it appraised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| It appraised for $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| And so the application we received is for $50,100, and it's a viable application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| The person purchasing the house will completely renovate it, and it will be for rent for a low to moderate income family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1503)|
| 0:25:12| And so we feel like this is a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| This has been a real problem to the neighborhood for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| It's a huge success to get that money paid back and the taxes and the liens against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| So well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1526)|

| 0:25:37| 11D is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute all documents on behalf of the city of Knoxville necessary to acquire property in fee simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1537)|

| 0:26:10| and is something that was purchased for the Pellissippi State Community Division Street Campus that I work at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| but it shouldn't be a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| I wasn't involved in the purchase and will not be involved in the right-of-way transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1584)|

| 0:27:11| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| Yeah, I don't know if I could ask Anne Wallace or Jim Hagerman to speak to this increase in cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| and I've gotten several questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| I don't know if you saw my email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| It went out pretty late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| Questions about things like the planter boxes, which are also part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| which we can talk about in detail more as we move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| but then also questions about the trolley line rails that are going to be dug up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| I believe that's one portion of this increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| Anne Wallace, Deputy Director for the Office of Redevelopment, Mayor, and Members of Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| thanks so much for having us here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| Very quickly on the trolley track removal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| because of the ties that are used to put in the trolley tracks, those have to be properly mitigated if we run into them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1676)|
| 0:28:05| With the medians that are being dug in the middle of the street, there's a high likelihood that we will run into them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| so we've worked with Southern Constructors to put together a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| It's an amount not to exceed, so if we don't run into them as much as they expect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| we won't need to use all of those funds, but because there's the likely presence that they're there in the middle of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| where we would be putting in the medians, we need to be able to properly dispose of them through the appropriate methods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| and getting them to the right facilities, and that comes with an additional cost that wasn't anticipated in the original contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| so that's a portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| The other items that are included, there was a significant amount more of backfill material that was needed throughout this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1717)|
| 0:28:44| largely because of the amount of stone and other cuts that were needed to put the stormwater lines in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| There was a lot more just aggregate material that was necessary to backfill those areas once those lines were situated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1730)|
| 0:28:59| We also ended up having to replace some grates and change out some materials, especially on driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| They were originally proposed to be asphalt, and we came back in and noted that the asphalt would have complications over time with ADA access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1744)|
| 0:29:12| and felt like going ahead and putting them in concrete would maintain longer term and in safer status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| so that's really what's included in the change order here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| Are there any other specific questions towards the budget amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| So is there a possibility that you won't run into the trolley ties and the rail lines, and they'll stay in the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1764)|
| 0:29:34| and then if they do come out, they're to be mitigated because of the materials in the railroad ties, the wood pieces that are soaked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1774)|
| 0:29:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| But the metal pieces, will the contractor recycle those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| I would assume so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| They did so with the Cumberland contract, and that's something that they are charged with properly disposing of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1792)|
| 0:30:01| I don't know the particulars on what they plan to do, but this is a sort of worst case scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| If they run into them, they need to be able to properly mitigate them and do it quickly so they have the chain of ownership for that material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| especially what is impacted environmentally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| You also asked about the planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| I'd be happy to address that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| The boxes that are in Happy Holler, I've gotten a lot of feedback from those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| and I addressed one issue with you by e-mail, and we can talk more about dealing with the trash and stuff that's gone in the bin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1826)|
| 0:30:33| Sure, and I will mention I did reach out to our public service director, Chad Weth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| and his team is going to be on some trash mitigation out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| We'll also be filling those shortly with soil, so that should help reduce the issue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| But those boxes were in the change order, and that's because you changed from one type to another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| No, we were originally hoping to be able to put plants in the ground on the west side of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| The reason we went to the planner boxes instead is because the AT&T duct line runs underneath the sidewalk in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| and it's too shallow to be able to put the street trees in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| You'll recall that prior to the streetscape project there were above ground planners in several locations on that side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| We felt like this was a more attractive replacement for those previous planters and that they would be more serviceable over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1874)|
| 0:31:21| Okay, so you cannot put them into the ground because of things under the ground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Yeah, the distance vertically from the top of the pavement to the top of the duct line is less than 2 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1885)|
| 0:31:33| and that would not support the growth of a tree or other plant material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| especially if someone needed to get in there and work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| Item 7F has a resolution authorizing the Mayor to enter into an agreement with the State of Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| to conduct a study of the Asheville Highway-East Magnolia Avenue and Rutledge Pike Interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| for a total cost of $250,000, with TDOT funding $200,000 and the City funding $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1918)|
| 0:32:05| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| I'd like to ask Donna Michelle Foster if she would just kind of give a little context to this for anyone that's watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| or does not have the additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Donna Michelle Foster, Director and Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| This is a project, Office of Redevelopment, also engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| We've been really excited about at least trying to get the study started from TDOT, getting the funding to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1949)|
| 0:32:36| This is an area, if you have ever driven that area, it's an interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| You can call it a Hotel California interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| You can get through there, but you can't get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| But it has some very maneuvers in there to get from East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1965)|
| 0:32:52| and also from South Rutledge Pike to get to Asheville Highway eastbound and also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| But it's been in several studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| The 2009 Magnolia Avenue Corridor Plan identified it as a special emphasis in the Burlington area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1980)|
| 0:33:08| The Burlington East Tennessee Design Center also acknowledged it as part of a study in the vision plan for Burlington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1988)|
| 0:33:15| and for the Burlington District as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| So if you've driven it, it encompasses about 15 acres, and it doesn't provide a lot of connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=1997)|
| 0:33:24| So these are some of the recommendations that we wanted to go forward to study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| to see how we can make it more of a multimodal option and use some of that acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| It's a large parcel of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| It's a lot of TDOT right-of-way in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| And I think it's a great time to do it right now where we've got the master plan for Chowee Park going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| as well as what we're doing in Burlington and also what the zoo is pursuing with their master plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2021)|
| 0:33:47| So I think it's a great opportunity to look at this interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| and see how we can provide more connectivity and multimodal options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| And I know it's one that has been on Councilman Wallace's radar as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| Yeah, I'm very excited to hear about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| and would be really interested in seeing what the study produces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| Once again, as you stated, we are anticipating some increased traffic in the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| hopefully with all the improvements that we have in place that are coming down the pike in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| It was first designed, I wanted to say, back in 1957 and probably constructed by 1960.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| I don't want to do the math for you all, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| We all know how long that's been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| So it's a great time to provide that because we know we have a lot of change of uses coming on board as development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2068)|
| 0:34:35| And right now that area only provides probably 11,000 traffic volumes in each leg of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2075)|
| 0:34:44| So it's not an abundance of traffic volumes going through that area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| So there's a way that we can kind of reduce that big interchange there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| and provide some other options as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Thank you for that explanation, Donna Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| I think you're very kind, but I'll say it bluntly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| and that intersection is broken for commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| And I think a redesign of that, either the T or the traffic circle that was recommended back in 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2109)|
| 0:35:16| would be a linchpin for commercial development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| And that's one of the most underutilized exits off the interstate that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| And it's left in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| So it's got a lot of upside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| And being able to get in and out of there and back to the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| or just through there is critical for commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| So it's a big deal, and I look forward to the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| And I really support it wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| So thank you for bringing it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2145)|

| 0:37:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| What is the current procedure for doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| I know when I looked through the code earlier, I saw mention of, I think, an emblem and the flag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2254)|
| 0:37:42| but I guess I'm unclear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| Mr. Swanson, are you the one to answer that question, what the current procedure is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| What the purpose of this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| Currently, the code simply provides for a design of the flag, and if you want to change the design of the flag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| the code provides for how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| It doesn't provide for protection of any other items of intellectual property that are owned by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2277)|
| 0:38:03| So if we have some very creative departments who put together some symbols or logos or things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2283)|
| 0:38:10| and, frankly, they are things that are worthy of being intellectually protected through the legal process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| we don't have a procedure in our code right now to have them declare official logos or symbols| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| or whatever they may be of the city, and this is the method by which we're going to accomplish that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| so that if we've got something that we want to protect, then we have the ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2312)|

| 0:39:11| No significant changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2351)|

| 0:39:18| or the one-year plan and even the sector plan designation, but no significant changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2358)|

| 0:40:38| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Gerald, my question on that is why they're going public storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2440)|
| 0:40:46| Why do they need an I-3 zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| That was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| Gerald Green, Knoxville, Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| The sector plan designation limits the zoning categories which can be designated for property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2454)|
| 0:41:01| The sector plan designation for this is, interestingly enough, an industrial sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2461)|
| 0:41:08| The I-3 was the only permitted zoning under that sector plan designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| which would permit the self-service storage that was proposed by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| So otherwise you'd have to go back, change the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| This was easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| Easier to do all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| Changing sector plan, one-year plan, and then getting the rezoning, just going to the zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2489)|

| 0:42:01| Council, we are now to the public forum, and one person has signed up to speak, Ms. Vivian Scheidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2521)|
| 0:42:07| Please come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2527)|

| 0:42:11| And as you know, we'll get a timer, and we thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2531)|
| 0:42:19| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| Vivian Scheidt, 2340 East of Magnolia, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| Our community is suffering from an unending cycle of trauma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| When I say our community, I mean all of our community, from 37934 Farragut, 37938 in deep north Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2549)|
| 0:42:37| 37920 up Chapman Highway to zip code 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| There is no boundary line for the unresolved grief in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| Indeed, the country is drowning from the physical and spiritual effects of gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2565)|
| 0:42:52| Tennessee is number 11 in the nation for deaths by gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| Knoxville, it has been reported, if the trend continues, will match the level of deaths by gun in this city at a level not seen since 1998,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2578)|
| 0:43:08| and that will be this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| Indeed, we may well surpass that year and once again hold another negative title that we do not want nor need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| Gun violence is an epidemic in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| So says the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| The violence is not only affecting the shooter and the victim, it is having long-term effects on families and community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2604)|
| 0:43:31| The only way to stop an epidemic is with prevention and intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| A method to be considered is to increase grief counseling, education, and training of coping skills, especially among our youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2615)|
| 0:43:43| We are forgetting the children when tragedies happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| They don't know how to cope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| Their parents are too broken from the tragedy to help themselves, let alone help the child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| Counseling is not free, but I feel it should be in some form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| Our children are acting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| They are scared, they're confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| Many grow up and do what they have seen done, dealing with situations in a violent manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| Many are now taking their own lives out of despair and desperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| The National Institute of Health has listed suicide among children ages under the age of 18 as a major health concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2651)|
| 0:44:19| Indeed, 43 percent of those children who are committing suicide or having suicidal thoughts are ages 5 to 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2659)|
| 0:44:27| Nationwide, 1.3 million children attempted suicide or had suicidal thoughts in the last four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2667)|
| 0:44:34| That is millions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| We must start where we are and do what we can with the resources that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| While we work on a state and federal level to increase funding, I ask the budget that we are going to present to our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2681)|
| 0:44:48| reflect a commitment to fund those programs that work with grief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| and provide them funds to do free preventive counseling before a tragedy occurs or up to a year afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2693)|
| 0:45:01| I have resources that I'd like to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| Reach out to me and I can help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| Those resources can tell you what's going on and it will break your heart and hopefully fill you with the resolve to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2706)|
| 0:45:14| When I say a year of post-counseling, I mean a year, as many are not yet healed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| And a grief is more than three days and they go back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| When a tragedy occurs, we take a plate or take a cake to the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| And then we go back with our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| For the families and the children and the community affected, they cannot go back to life as usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| Life as usual is no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| Let us begin to take a new approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| Let's take some help to the people before something happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| The very act of prevention and intervention may be the difference in life and death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| Remember, we are all community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| Counsel, that is the end of public forum and there's no other business, so we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| Have a good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190409?start=2759)|
