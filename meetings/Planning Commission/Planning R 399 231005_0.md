| 0:11:18| We will now move to our first agenda item, number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| Applicant, Maple Lane Homes, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| Location, north side of Westridge Drive, west side of Greg Ruth Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=687)|
| 0:11:33| Approximate size of track, 19,345 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| Present plan and zoning designation, civic and institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| RN1, single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| Proposed plan designation, low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| Existing land use is public, quasi-public land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| Staff recommendation, this will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| Staff recommendation, approve the sector plan amendment to LDR, low density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| because it is consistent with the conditions and development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=724)|
| 0:12:12| Motion number two, staff recommendation, approve the one-year amendment to low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| because it is compatible with surrounding land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=741)|
| 0:12:33| Here on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| We have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| Would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| I'd like to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North North Shore Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| Here on behalf of the applicant, Maple Lane Homes, and we'll take these in order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| but this is the initial one is for the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| We're requesting a sector plan amendment from the current plan designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| which is CI, civic institutional, to LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| I assume or presume that the CI designation, if staff can pull it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=789)|
| 0:13:17| to show the sector plan for the area, that it received that designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=797)|
| 0:13:23| because this property used to be owned by the Church of the Nazareth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| My client has recently purchased this property, which brings us to this request here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| So in looking at the surrounding property, our little finger annex that currently has a sector plan of CI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=813)|
| 0:13:41| obviously is inconsistent with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| The area is in the West Hills area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| It may primarily consist of single family low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| There's a school and there's some other churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| but in following staff's recommendation to approve this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| we do find that or feel that it supports the requirements necessary for the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| and ask that you approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| We have four people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| Dale Grotherton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=854)|
| 0:14:23| I live across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| Mr. Grotherton, if you could give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| Dale Grotherton, 7404 West Ridge Drive, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=868)|
| 0:14:35| I've lived across the street from this property for 43 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| and my property has 2.2 acres, one house, one residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| And I don't agree that it's like kind property because we don't have any duplexes in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=885)|
| 0:14:52| and it's my understanding that that's what they're wanting to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| And that lot, as you can see, when he pulled up the map of the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| has a little expenditure across the back, which is pretty useless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| If you don't count that, it's a little over a third of an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| And for a duplex, you know, that's a pretty small lot, especially in that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| where everybody's got, you know, half an acre or more, and some have as much as two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| So I think it's highly inappropriate, and that lot drops off pretty steeply from the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=922)|
| 0:15:30| and those lots on that north side of that street, the driveways don't get any sun in the wintertime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| They freeze, and all the people that live on that side park on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=936)|
| 0:15:42| Actually, today there were two cars parked on the street over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| and that street gets a lot of traffic because it goes down to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| You get all the kids going down to the school, the bikers use that as a connector through the bike trails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| all the people with little kids going down to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| So, you know, I've seen people almost get hit, you know, coming in and out behind cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| I've actually hit a car, you know, in the wintertime when they were all parked out there on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| They'd park on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| So if we get a duplex over there on a third of an acre, you know, where are they going to put all their cars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=971)|
| 0:16:18| You know, are they going to put them on the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| And it's just going to make it that much worse than it already is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| And I don't see the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| I mean, I'd be glad, happy to see a, you know, single family residence there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| but I don't agree with this low density, you know, duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=991)|
| 0:16:39| I just don't think it's appropriate for our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| Chris Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1005)|
| 0:16:56| Hello, I'm Chris Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| I've lived across the street from the lot in question for about 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1018)|
| 0:17:04| I bought a house there, an RN1 zoning house there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1024)|
| 0:17:10| and I bought a house there across the street from a lot that was zoned RN1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| and I think I would like to see it continue to be zoned RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| I agree with everything that my next door neighbor said, Dale, about the parking situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| about the lot size, 100% in agreement with Dale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| This comment may or may not save time, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| today we're only looking at the RN1 rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1059)|
| 0:17:46| There would be another process if the applicant decided to go propose a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1066)|
| 0:17:52| that would be under a special use consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| So that's another step beyond today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Chuck Price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| Isn't that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| Excuse me, yeah, plan amendment, excuse me, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1092)|
| 0:18:20| Let's see, Chuck Price or Matt Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1100)|
| 0:18:33| Yes, Matt Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| I live at 7405 Westridge Drive, Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1116)|
| 0:18:45| So there is a lot between my house and this proposed lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1125)|
| 0:18:53| So I've been a West Hills resident for just a little over two and a half years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| and I think the neighbors do agree and understand what you were saying about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| we don't really oppose to this zoning becoming a RN1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| and we understand the reason why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| But I think the primary purpose for us speaking today is just that we know West Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1151)|
| 0:19:20| community is routinely coming under fire with new developments and new rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| So even though we know we all agree that RN1 is the appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| I think it's more of like a show of concern of what the future amendment could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| or rezoning in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| So I do know that the intent is to eventually construct a duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1181)|
| 0:19:52| and it's just more to reiterate that our fear is that is not within the character of West Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1192)|
| 0:20:01| and we're just going to routinely continue to come to these meetings beyond this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1201)|
| 0:20:08| So we will agree with RN1, but beyond that, we're going to strictly oppose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1208)|
| 0:20:15| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1217)|
| 0:20:23| Again, we're not asking for a rezoning from RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| RN1 is the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| We're sticking with the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| It's just simply a sector plan amendment to bring it in line with the adjacent surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| Commissioner Schell, so for a special use approval for the residents here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1240)|
| 0:20:50| that would require a site plan to be submitted, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1250)|
| 0:20:57| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| Well, given that this is a pretty straightforward plan amendment and one-year plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| I'll go ahead and move to approve the sector plan amendment to LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| because it is consistent with the conditions and development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| We've got a motion from Commissioner Schell, so to approve the sector plan amendment to LDR per staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1275)|
| 0:21:25| seconded by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Next, we need another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Yeah, I'll go ahead and also move to approve the one-year plan amendment to LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| because it is compatible with the surrounding land uses per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| We've got a motion by Commissioner Schell, so to approve the one-year plan amendment to LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| because it is compatible with the surrounding land uses, seconded by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| On to agenda item number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| Applicant Smeedy Busby Architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| Location northeast quadrant of the intersection of Union Avenue and State Street, 1.12 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1329)|
| 0:22:16| Present zoning, DKG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| Zoning requested is DKB, which is a downtown district boulevard sub-district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1339)|
| 0:22:27| existing land use, transportation, communications, utilities, parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| Staff recommendation is to deny the DKB sub-district because the property is not consistent with the district's intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1351)|
| 0:22:43| Is the applicant available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| Scott Busby, 2554 Sutherland Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1365)|
| 0:23:02| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| Seeing no opposition, you may proceed, Mr. Busby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| So a couple of things, not a whole lot has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| It's kind of deja vu here, a little bit from last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| But we do want to bring up a couple of points that have been discussed kind of around the point but not made up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1399)|
| 0:23:28| It was made obvious and aware that this street, State Street, is not a super public street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1408)|
| 0:23:35| There's not a lot of walkability on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| And it's the intent of the design of the program itself to help increase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| There is actually currently 60% of the facade on the ground level is designed as retail and commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1422)|
| 0:23:50| And that commercial is planned to intend to be a restaurant, retail, coffee shop kind of thing that is hoped to attract more foot traffic to that spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1430)|
| 0:24:01| So the actual pieces that is designed as work live is about 40% of the entire street facades that are along there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1441)|
| 0:24:11| So the majority of the design as it is now is commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| It provides some housing options that are not currently available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| And as we know, there are a little bit of a shortage of housing right now in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| And including some workforce housing that are planned in the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| And if the exterior public spaces we're providing are actually covered as part of the exterior of the coffee shop retail area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1472)|
| 0:24:41| so it can be an inviting space for people to actually hang out in as well as the stoops that are along the facade along the State Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1481)|
| 0:24:49| So it will, we think, actually activate that street in more ways than it currently is doing now as a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1489)|
| 0:24:56| So the last thing that we've been asked to kind of say is that the required commercial use on the ground floor really makes this project non-financeable right now for the foreseeable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1496)|
| 0:25:07| So if we have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1507)|
| 0:25:18| Commissioner Higgins. Thank you. Can we get this map on the screen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| The one that was passed out at the agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| So really, for now, all I want to say is I have nothing against the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1528)|
| 0:25:35| I think that we need this these parking lots to be developed. And I am excited to see what gets built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1535)|
| 0:25:43| But to rezone for a very specific part of their program is kind of like the tail wagging the dog in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1543)|
| 0:25:58| It doesn't really make sense. And when you look at this map of the downtown zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1558)|
| 0:26:05| it's more clear why staff is opposing this or recommending denial and why I can't support this either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1565)|
| 0:26:14| Because if you look at this map, the green area is the zone that they are requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1574)|
| 0:26:21| The purple area is the zone that they are currently under. And then can we hover over where their site is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1581)|
| 0:26:30| I don't know if that shows up. Yeah. So over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| So you can see a very clear pattern and intentionality as to where the boulevard districts were overlaid in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1593)|
| 0:26:42| They relate to those high vehicular traffic areas and have accompanying design guidelines for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1602)|
| 0:26:52| So my opposition to this is strictly because it is completely backwards to what the zoning for the downtown area is laid out to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1612)|
| 0:27:05| So I hope that we can all agree on that. But, you know, I just don't see how it makes any sense for us to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1625)|
| 0:27:16| And their only rationale is a very specific element of their program, not a zoning related need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1636)|
| 0:27:24| So thank you. Well, your hope that everyone agrees with you may not come to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1644)|
| 0:27:34| Commissioner Browning. Thank you, Chairman Hill. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| With all due respect to Commissioner Higgins, I do disagree with this for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1659)|
| 0:27:49| Number one, last week, the developer stood up here and spoke to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1669)|
| 0:27:55| And I really do see A, B and C streets right now with downtown and that street there on where this is proposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1675)|
| 0:28:07| I mean, is a C street. And I just don't see it lending itself to commercial use at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| At the same time, you know, the plans specifically say that if there is ever commercial demand down there, that they can be retrofitted to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1694)|
| 0:28:28| You know, I think we're kind of getting the best of both worlds right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| And also, I mean, this development is not going to happen if we don't approve this to DKB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1712)|
| 0:28:41| So personally, I'll wait to hear other comments, but I'm going to make a motion to rezone from DKG to DKB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1721)|
| 0:28:56| We've got a motion from Commissioner Browning to rezone from DKG to DKB, seconded by Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1736)|
| 0:29:07| We have other lights and more conversation. So let's go to Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1747)|
| 0:29:16| I think that, you know, a B street will never become an A street or a C street will never become a B street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1756)|
| 0:29:25| unless we stick to a plan that our community decided we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| And that plan is to enforce having, you know, commercial venues on ground levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1770)|
| 0:29:39| If we continue to fill these streets with just townhome style doors, you know, they're not going to become walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1779)|
| 0:29:48| I understand there's a degree of a plan that in this particular site has been proposed to have some commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1788)|
| 0:29:56| but we're not looking at a plan. We're looking at a zone and what is appropriate for where this zone is, where the property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1796)|
| 0:30:05| And so, you know, the idea of a development won't happen because of this one specific need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1805)|
| 0:30:12| Well, I mean, if someone was proposing a factory right there, would we have the same argument?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| I mean, it's it's that's the other extreme in my eyes is, you know, threatening a development as not happening because of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1817)|
| 0:30:28| I'm going down. Never mind. But I agree that we should not rezone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| So I'll be voting against approving it. Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1834)|
| 0:30:43| I want to pull this. I don't have to. I really appreciate what Commissioner Higgins said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| And Commissioner Browning, I was more in your camp last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| I thought about this a lot, though, and I disagree with the comment made by the applicant that that street is not walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1855)|
| 0:31:07| It's incredibly walkable. It's got everything you need for walkability except a reason to walk there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1867)|
| 0:31:15| And I think that the thing that would bring the reason to walk there is more commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1875)|
| 0:31:21| And I think that is what this zone is trying to guide development to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| So I I concur that we won't get that change if we keep changing the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1887)|
| 0:31:35| So I am going to support the denial and I will not be supporting the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1895)|
| 0:31:43| Thank you, Commissioner Huber. Well, I guess on the other side, I would disagree respectfully with Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1903)|
| 0:31:54| But, yeah, I feel like we're just drilling down a little too much on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| I mean, it's still in the in the mixed use regional center plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1918)|
| 0:32:04| I mean, it's in the sector plan. And the differences between the DKB and the DKG are so minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| You know what I think I'm hearing Mr. Busby say is 60 percent of it's already going to be commercial, which is the only thing we're really talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1930)|
| 0:32:19| And so the question to me is you've got 40 percent that might be a live work scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1939)|
| 0:32:27| So that's really all we're talking about is 40 percent of one floor of this is the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| But it is the difference that is a go or no go for the entire deal so that, you know, I've been down that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1953)|
| 0:32:42| I mean, even since last month, I visited the street again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| Again, given that the hotel or part of the apartment complex next door is already built to this same exact standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1966)|
| 0:32:56| You know, the zones have been changed since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| I think it's the right thing to do to zone it to DKB. I do not think it's injurious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| You know, it's not going to not allow that type of development somewhere else in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| But we have an opportunity here where the differences are so minor, yet it allows a good quality project to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=1993)|
| 0:33:22| So I'll most definitely be in support. Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2002)|
| 0:33:28| Yeah, I'm a little torn on this one. I definitely appreciate Commissioner Hagan's perspective and others as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2008)|
| 0:33:35| I guess a question for me. Is there anything in the DKB zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| Should this be rezoned that would require that 60 percent usage for retail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| Or if you guys go to the bank in two months and interest rates go up and, you know, they say, actually, we think there needs to be more residential here to make this pencil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2026)|
| 0:33:54| Is that something that could foreseeably kind of change in terms of, you know, full ground use of retail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2034)|
| 0:34:01| And I think that's what the zoning is currently protecting against. And I don't know how this change could affect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2041)|
| 0:34:08| Good afternoon. I actually live at 300 State Street. I'm a neighbor here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| Excuse me just a minute. Was that addressed to Mr. Goss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| Not necessarily, but I'm curious to hear your response as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| All right. Well, thank you. You know, the requirement is commercial. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| And what we're putting together is an economic model and a development that we think meets the spirit of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| However, it doesn't meet the letter of that. And so, Commissioner Higgins, I appreciate what you have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| However, what you're asking me to do is fix problems that the city created, State Street Garage, the Promenade Garage, the back of the cinema.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2078)|
| 0:34:48| Like, we're all blessed and better to have those. But it makes the street, it's walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| However, it doesn't make it the street that has all the attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| And actually, when you put into the elevated walkway from the State Street parking garage to Gay Street, which most people take, it takes the feet off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2097)|
| 0:35:06| And so you're asking me to go ahead and spend money that really isn't viable to spend on something today that there's not a market for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2106)|
| 0:35:16| You know, another issue is this. Right. You know, how do we possibly build on State Street until the city fixes the things that they've created?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2116)|
| 0:35:26| I'm sorry. It's just not possible. I would rather build what the letter of this code requirement is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2126)|
| 0:35:33| But it really isn't economically feasible. You know, another issue is inside those guidelines right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| Right at the top, the quote says, you know, to encourage. Right. And this is the goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| But it also uses the word flexible. And we're just asking to be flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| You know, the grid zone does not meet the requirements that that is financially feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| We're just choosing the options that we're given. Right. And so I think Commissioner Huber is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| It's only a minor difference. Just, I guess, maybe turn my question to the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2164)|
| 0:36:11| Is there anything in DKB that would require a ground floor retail presence or not necessarily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2171)|
| 0:36:20| I'll be happy to address that now. DKB's on the boulevard district does not allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2180)|
| 0:36:27| It's put this way. It allows multifamily on structures, which would then allow residential on the ground floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2187)|
| 0:36:34| The only thing that the DKG does not allow is residential on the ground floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| But everything else would be permissible. I guess that's my concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| is that the rezoning in the light of changing economic circumstances could lead to that 60 percent evaporating potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2204)|
| 0:36:51| I hope it doesn't. But I think that's just something we have to take into consideration, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| Well, the 50 percent is being built as commercial. Commissioner Schilso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2217)|
| 0:37:04| See, I was also thinking about, you know, if the project were to happen to change hands, the same concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2224)|
| 0:37:12| Could this plan after a rezone, they could go back before DRB for a different design as well, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2232)|
| 0:37:20| OK, so none of this current plan is locked in stone that we've seen. In fact, they've approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2240)|
| 0:37:27| The plan we've seen has been approved at DRB. The idea of live work that we debated on a lot of that floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2247)|
| 0:37:35| ground floor has been approved, just hasn't been portrayed in a manner that seems to coincide with live work. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2255)|
| 0:37:49| I don't want to speak on behalf of my colleagues at Plans Review Inspection, but yes, that's my understanding. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| So, I mean, I'm very supportive of the plan that's that I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| I'd like to see that come to fruition and I don't see the need for a rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2278)|
| 0:38:05| You know, I think the challenge that we're faced with here is that we don't have a really good solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2285)|
| 0:38:16| We don't have another good option in this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2296)|
| 0:38:23| I mean, I see this as a, State Street's really a glorified service alley, if you will. It's a service street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2303)|
| 0:38:32| When you think about, you know, you walk from, say, what does it run, south to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| and you start with parking lots and a church and then a graveyard and then more parking lots on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2318)|
| 0:38:45| And then you have the State Street garage, you have the back of the Tennessee Theater, you have an escalator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2325)|
| 0:38:51| you have the promenade, you have, it's just, there's no retail there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| And to imagine that there would ever be retail there just seems really far-fetched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| And I want to, I just want to cite a couple of examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| When you look at State Supreme Court site, you know, they recognize that retail was not a sustainable option for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2347)|
| 0:39:18| And so they integrated really just service solutions to serve the people who live within that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2358)|
| 0:39:28| I think it was a bike storage and maybe a workout facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| And so, I mean, I agree there are far greater consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| And the reverse of this is when you see street-level residential on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2379)|
| 0:39:47| And that's a horrible solution there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| It's a great consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| And we have some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| And we have some buildings that back up to Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| And that's a horrible thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| But in this case, I just don't see how we, you know, the developer is screaming at you right now saying if there was any potential for retail, he would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2397)|
| 0:40:11| And the reason he would do it, and we typically don't introduce economics because the developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| usually he's arguing for a better economic condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| In this case, he's telling you I'm going to convert it to something that's going to give me half the revenue than the commercial option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2420)|
| 0:40:29| You'll get $40, $45 a foot in a commercial option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| He's going to get probably, I don't know, $250 a foot in residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| And commercial pays CAM taxes and insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| He's telling you it's not there or I would be doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| And I just find it difficult to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| And it's not this particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| I'm not looking at this particular development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| I'm looking at that stretch of State Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| And for anybody, in 2003, my first development was in the old city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| And all there was was vacant buildings and rummage retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| And we put residential on the ground floor at 137 South Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| And the market changed later because it had more of an opportunity to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| And it's no longer residential now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| So just because it's residential today doesn't mean it's going to be residential forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| Let the market dictate in some cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| So Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| And I agree with a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| And I know that there's been multiple areas of downtown that people have looked at and said, oh, nothing will ever survive there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2489)|
| 0:41:36| And then something changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| And now everyone's trying to get those lots, those spaces, those, you know, in buildings and new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2498)|
| 0:41:48| So I think what bothers me, and I really support the development again, and I don't want to dictate anyone's use of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2508)|
| 0:41:56| But we're talking about spot zoning in the oldest neighborhood in our city for the intention of a small percentage of a difference on the desired program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2516)|
| 0:42:11| You know, it's been discussed, like Commissioner Huber said, it's a small percentage of commercial that they don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2531)|
| 0:42:18| And it's not just retail that this says to put down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| It's just commercial in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| And they've even said, they've stated that they have a solution for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| They could do the live work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| There is, there are solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| They've talked about they're putting commercial in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| It's just facing the other direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| That's changing the plan around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| So I know that that's, you know, that costs and that there's work that has to go into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| But we, I don't think it's a good precedent for us to spot zone something like this over a small use that is before us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2563)|
| 0:42:54| We've all seen plans in downtown come and go and change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| And there was mention of the difference between these two zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| I know it seems like there's minor differences, but we have an entire 100-plus page book of guidelines that lays out the distinct characters that each of these zones should have to keep in character with how they were developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2583)|
| 0:43:19| So there's a lot more that goes into it rather than just a, you know, this isn't just DK and DK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2599)|
| 0:43:27| There's a lot more depth to the difference between these two zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| And so I just, I don't see the rationale from a zoning standpoint, because we try to avoid spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2612)|
| 0:43:41| We try to avoid rezoning based off of use or based off one specific person's request and their use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2621)|
| 0:43:48| And it just doesn't make sense for us to change that pattern for this scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2628)|
| 0:43:56| Thank you. Commissioner Higgins. Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2636)|
| 0:44:03| I think I can tell how this vote is going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| But I do want to say for the record, I'm very much for developing that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| And I have liked everything that I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| So I'm not against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| I think it's the same case that Commissioner Higgins is making, is that it feels like we're only supposed to be looking at the land use in the zone and be looking at the guidance of a designation that was made because of some of the mistakes, Chigger Hill, that I think people were responding to, like residential on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2659)|
| 0:44:44| That's why this designation happened, because there was a recognition that we don't want just Gay Street to be the only hustling, bustling kind of place for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2684)|
| 0:44:53| We want that to be happening on the streets that follow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| And I think that the kind of commercial activity that is possible on that street is actually very different from the example that you gave about the renovated courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2697)|
| 0:45:15| State Supreme Court site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| Thank you. If I'm thinking of the site that you're talking about where the commercial was positioned on Henley, am I thinking of the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2716)|
| 0:45:26| They also had some on the—I think it was surrounded by four streets, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2726)|
| 0:45:33| For at least two, perhaps three of those street-facing areas, especially Henley, it is miserable to walk on Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2733)|
| 0:45:45| The traffic speed that is happening there or the traffic stalls that are happening there make that not a really great place for a human scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2745)|
| 0:45:54| But State Street, where this is, is very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| And the parking opportunities that are there for someone who wants to shop or spend time in a retail commercial establishment there are also a lot greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2757)|
| 0:46:07| So I feel like that's a very different example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| And when I hear, you know, that's never going to happen there or someone who thinks that that could happen there, that's just sort of pipe dreaming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2771)|
| 0:46:21| That is exactly what people said to me when I lived downtown before downtown became the downtown that we know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2781)|
| 0:46:28| People thought it was crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| But we have a really wonderful downtown now that is continuing to thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2790)|
| 0:46:36| And I think if we start changing the rules that have been crafted in response to other errors that we feel like we made as we grew into our downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2796)|
| 0:46:46| I think we're setting ourselves up to keep doing those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| So, like I said, I think I know where the vote is going, but I want that to be developed, and I'm excited about what the opportunities are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2810)|
| 0:46:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| I think our downtown is awesome now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| I mean, 20 years ago it was nothing like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| But I think the flexibility of city council and planning commission and the zonings that have been worked over the last 20 years or what got it there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2827)|
| 0:47:19| not as much are going to cause the demise of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| I think the flexibility in any of these in looking at it is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| But I'd also like to point out again, again, respectfully, Logan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2847)|
| 0:47:34| I don't think this is a spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| Yes, it is zoned DKG right now, but it's in the general plan for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2856)|
| 0:47:43| It's in the one-year plan in the city as well as the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| So, we're fitting all those things just because we changed the base zone inside those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=2866)|

| 0:51:01| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| My name is Erica Munoz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| The address is 2812 Merchants Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| This is the first time I do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| I know nothing about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| I am requesting to rezone this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| We are trying to build a venue, waiting venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| I know the property across, it's, let me find my paper here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3081)|
| 0:51:31| The property across ours, it's sown as CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| And the one in the corner, I think it's a gas station, it's also CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3097)|
| 0:51:44| That's why we decided to request to rezone this property as CG1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3104)|
| 0:51:52| because of my understanding is the CG1 will allow me to build what my plans are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3112)|
| 0:52:02| the venue, waiting venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| I am, this is the first time I am investing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3124)|
| 0:52:10| I have come to the, to this office to ask, you know, permissions and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3130)|
| 0:52:17| Everyone is helping me a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| And I don't know what else to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| No opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3149)|

| 0:52:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3158)|
| 0:52:50| Mr. Vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3170)|
| 0:53:01| This one is very tough for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| Because I do understand staff's position here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3184)|
| 0:53:10| In keeping this plan designation to more of a neighborhood commercial because of the school across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| and the way this hub needs to form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| I was a part of the group that did the larger shopping center across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| which certainly wouldn't have been considered neighborhood commercial at the time to try to generate some commercial hub at that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3207)|
| 0:53:35| And it didn't fare well long term because of it probably should have been more of a neighborhood type place, I'm assuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3215)|
| 0:53:44| So I'll make the motion to deny the sector plan per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3224)|
| 0:53:53| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3233)|

| 0:54:13| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3253)|

| 0:54:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| Commissioner Adams, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3272)|

| 0:56:12| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street here for the McNabb Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| We have one opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| And that would be, is this Mr. Chris Winn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| Mr. Winn, would you like to proceed or defer, Mr. Mullins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| I'll defer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3391)|
| 0:56:39| Chris Winn, 4404 Oak Bank Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| Also vice president, Oak Bank HOA Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3402)|
| 0:56:48| Before, I was unaware of the changes, of the invasive changes onto our street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3408)|
| 0:56:56| I understand that those have been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| But what has not been changed is the existing fence between McNabb Center and the houses that are in Oak Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3419)|
| 0:57:10| I don't know if there's any plan to update that or update that fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3430)|
| 0:57:17| Also, some of the stuff I was reading that, which it's probably taken care of because they're not going to be invasive to our street at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3437)|
| 0:57:30| But the main thing I'm hearing is for the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| Thank you, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| This has been back before this body a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| Back in 2021, we had two different proposals that came through and were approved for use on review to expand this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3467)|
| 0:57:55| McNabb Center never moved forward with either of those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| They looked at some other options before coming back and scrapping those previous two plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3478)|
| 0:58:04| and coming up with a larger overall plan for the expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| In the past, I think the approved expansion was from 46 to 66 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3488)|
| 0:58:14| This current proposal adds an additional six beds for a total of 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3494)|
| 0:58:20| And there's 11 existing rooms with 13 new for 24 total sleeping rooms is what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3500)|
| 0:58:28| Mr. Nguyen is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| The previous plan had us having an access lane for service vehicles off of Oak Bank Lane, and that was one of the concerns he raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3510)|
| 0:58:38| The last time we were here before this body on this property, and we've terminated that access lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3518)|
| 0:58:44| Regarding the existing fence, I think this came up the last time too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| and we believe that fence may have actually been placed on the neighbor's property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3529)|
| 0:58:57| We're trying to figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| We understand it needs maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| It's an older fence and may need some maintenance, and we're happy to talk to them about maybe helping maintain that fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| We just need to determine which side of the line it's on, and if it is, in fact, on their line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| then we'll need their permission, obviously, to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| If it is on our line, we'll be glad to maintain it and make sure that it is kept up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| But that's something that we tried to get an answer for today once Mr. Nguyen told me that was one of his concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3559)|
| 0:59:25| but we haven't been able to figure that out yet, but we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| Regardless, other than that, we appreciate staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| We ask that you follow the staff's recommendation and approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| and I'm here and Mr. Smeltzer is here if there's any additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| Thank you, Councilor Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| Mr. Chair, I'd like to make a motion we approve the request to expand the existing residential drug alcohol treatment facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3587)|
| 0:59:53| to a 72-bed with telephoto area as read with four conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3593)|
| 0:59:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| We have a motion to approve per staff recommendation by Vice Chair Uten, seconded by Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3602)|
| 1:00:10| And Mr. Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| I just had a question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| Do you know, do we know if this will trigger a buffer, a landscape buffer requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3614)|
| 1:00:26| As a non-residential district abutting a residential district, it would trigger a class B buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3626)|
| 1:00:33| So if anyone is concerned, there will be a buffer required there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| and more than likely incorporating a fence will be a contributing aspect of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3639)|
| 1:00:47| That's one of those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| So with the motion approved per staff recommendation with the four conditions, we have that motion and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3651)|

| 1:06:12| We put forward a really thoughtful proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| We hope that you will find that it is pretty comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| Middle housing is about promoting the development of neighborhood scale housing forms which are compatible with existing housing in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3978)|
| 1:06:25| Our goal is to begin the process of creating more diverse housing options at a variety of price points for Knoxville residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3985)|
| 1:06:34| As Mayor Kincannon indicated at the opening of the city council workshop last week, this is one piece, a small piece, of an overall housing strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=3994)|
| 1:06:45| The intent is to bring forward a more comprehensive housing plan in a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| Based on their experience with cities across the country, Optico's design emphasized that missing middle housing is not necessarily a good fit across all areas of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4010)|
| 1:07:01| And that cities with the most success have started with a limited geographic area that already has access to infrastructure like transit, it's walkable and bikeable, and has access to neighborhood servicing businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4021)|
| 1:07:15| Traditional neighborhood residential, TDR, is described as a mix of detached and attached houses, often on smaller lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4035)|
| 1:07:25| TDR is walkable and bikeable, it aligns well with the CAT reimagined routes that will take effect next year, and residents have access to businesses close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4045)|
| 1:07:36| This is the geographic area that the plan is based on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| I met with more than 40 individuals during the time we were working on the plan to gain insights before it launched the end of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4060)|
| 1:07:49| These included residents in the neighborhoods impacted, it included several local small residential contractors, as that is who is most likely to be building middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4069)|
| 1:07:59| It also included many who are concerned about the need for housing in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| While middle housing was not really designed specifically to be an affordable housing strategy, it does not mean it cannot be affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4084)|
| 1:08:14| I have met with several of our local non-profit developers about this plan, and they're particularly excited to see this come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4094)|
| 1:08:22| Since our plan launched via the city's website, in addition to the planning site, we've spoken with neighborhood groups, hosted two community open house events, and conducted a city council workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4102)|
| 1:08:34| We appreciate the attendance of the community, and to those of you who were able to attend, we appreciate that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4114)|
| 1:08:42| All the comments from the open house events can be found on the planning site with the case item, and soon to come on the city site as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4122)|
| 1:08:51| As I think you're aware, we are pleased to have Optico's design conduct a peer review of our middle housing plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4131)|
| 1:08:57| We took those suggestions, the comments, and the discussion from the open house events, as well as suggestions and comments from the city council workshop, and made some small tweaks to our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4137)|
| 1:09:08| The result were some additional clarifying edits, primarily to the language, with no substantive changes or changes to the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4148)|
| 1:09:16| We truly appreciate all those who provided comments, including some from this body and those who reached out with suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4156)|
| 1:09:23| Finally, we hope this will be the first phase of several to come, related not only to middle housing, but other land use items that have come up as a result of this work, and comments and suggestions from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4163)|
| 1:09:35| However, this is the first step, and I will be happy to take any questions when you're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4175)|
| 1:09:41| Commissioner, we have, I think, ten people signed up. Eleven people signed up for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4181)|
| 1:09:50| So, I'm going to recommend, what, I'll throw something out there, say, two minutes per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4190)|
| 1:10:03| Anybody got any better ideas? Any suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| Two minutes per person? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| Alright, that's what it'll be. Two minutes per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| They don't have to use all two minutes, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| That's right. They don't have to. They'll get good time credit if they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4215)|
| 1:10:22| Okay. Alright. So, I'll just go down the list here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| Are all of the persons signed up in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| No, we have some for and some against, and some might even be somewhere in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| Okay. Alright. Zoe Scott. Zoe Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4239)|
| 1:10:48| And I'm going to put somebody on deck here, just so you'll be ready. Erin Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4248)|
| 1:10:55| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| Miss Scott, if you'll give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| Zoe Scott, 4013 Heather Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| I'm speaking on behalf of BikeWalk Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| As a non-profit organization that works to make Knoxville a better place to bike and walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| for people of all ages, abilities, and backgrounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| we are super thrilled to support this proposal from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| We think that it's a great way to encourage walkable, bikeable, accessible neighborhoods for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| and we think that it's a great first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| And then next on deck will be Christina Bowler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4284)|
| 1:11:31| If I may, Christina Bowler is stuck in traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| and she has asked me to read her comments for her, if that's allowed, after I read my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4295)|
| 1:11:43| Is this legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| Okay. That'll be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| We need more housing, we need it closer to the city, and we needed it yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| So let's support this measure today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| This proposal is not perfect, and in isolation will do nothing to stabilize our housing market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4317)|
| 1:12:03| But it is a good first step toward the goals of increasing housing supply and diversity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4323)|
| 1:12:11| reconnecting our walkable neighborhoods, and building our tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4331)|
| 1:12:17| I'd like to briefly address three key points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| A quadplex should be allowed on a 45-foot wide lot if the other dimensional standards can be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4340)|
| 1:12:27| The current proposal has the standard as a higher lot width, which would preclude a quadplex from a typical lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4347)|
| 1:12:37| Please modify this proposal to re-allow quadplexes in our traditional neighborhoods as they are a traditional typology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4357)|
| 1:12:47| All typologies are compatible with all of the base zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| Please allow all of these middle housing types in all base zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| The whole point is that they look and act compatible with single-family homes while providing more units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| less maintenance per person, less cost, more connectivity, and more tax dollars per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4383)|
| 1:13:10| Let's allow these benefits in all zones, and let's allow all people the freedom to determine where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4390)|
| 1:13:21| Finally, demolitions and conversions should not be grounds to hold this proposal up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4401)|
| 1:13:26| The cost of land acquisition and the actual cost of demolishing an existing home would rule out this scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4406)|
| 1:13:34| unless that existing home is truly rotting and didn't hold much market value anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4414)|
| 1:13:40| Conversions are extremely unlikely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| Yet, the public is wary of this, and it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| We've all seen historic homes get chopped up into thoughtless and unsafe apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| Well, this is no longer a possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| because new building codes have been adopted since that house you saw that was chopped up that will prevent this from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4437)|
| 1:14:05| These codes, especially the commercial code, which is applicable to a triplex and greater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4445)|
| 1:14:11| are so much more advanced in the realm of fire safety than how older homes and multiplexes were commonly built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4451)|
| 1:14:20| Their implementation in a conversion would be extremely invasive and infeasible to an existing older home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4460)|
| 1:14:28| Fire-rated walls, special doors and seals, fire-rated structural connections, special duct openings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4468)|
| 1:14:36| sprinkler system piping, sprinkler riser rooms, fire department access points, and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| all make this an extremely unlikely scenario and, frankly, a poor choice for an investment on the part of a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4482)|
| 1:14:50| Additional demolition and preservation efforts may be positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| but these should be done outside of this proposal and within the overlay districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| Demolition protection should be based on protecting the historic value of what is already existing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4500)|
| 1:15:07| not legislated based on what is being proposed to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| Given these and other points raised in the comments, let's say yes to this positive change now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4512)|
| 1:15:17| Let's say yes to modifying it to be better now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| And let's say yes to building on it as soon as it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| I'd like to thank everyone who has worked on this and engaged with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| Zoning policy is notoriously challenging to update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| And I appreciate everyone's efforts to make Knoxville a more connected, free, and equitable city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4533)|
| 1:15:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4540)|
| 1:15:47| And this is on behalf of Christina Bowler, and I have not practiced this at all or even read it all the way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4547)|
| 1:15:56| So here it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| This is comments from Christina Bowler of 302 Douglas Avenue, AIA, meaning she is a registered architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4559)|
| 1:16:10| I'm speaking as both a locally practicing architect and a Knoxville resident of more than 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| who has lived in multiple neighborhoods affected by this proposal as both a tenant and property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4575)|
| 1:16:22| I'm here to speak in support of this application because I believe Knoxville's zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| dating back more than 50 years have imposed a nontraditional and anti-urbanist spirit on the heart of Knoxville neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4587)|
| 1:16:35| which historically featured housing diversity, walkability, and streetcar transit oriented toward the working class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4595)|
| 1:16:44| Although many have expressed concerns that the character of our historic neighborhoods will be compromised by the construction of middle housing types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4604)|
| 1:16:53| I feel exactly the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| Middle housing types are specifically characteristic of our historic neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| However, after reviewing the proposed amendments in conjunction with city lot data provided by Knoxville-Knox County Planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4622)|
| 1:17:10| I am not convinced that they would result in tremendous increase in middle housing development opportunities in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4630)|
| 1:17:17| The housing type with the greatest number of development opportunities are duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| which were permitted by right in the heart of Knoxville neighborhoods prior to the adoption of recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4642)|
| 1:17:27| though the dimensional standards were a bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| Although allowing duplexes in our neighborhoods is a huge step in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| I don't think this proposal provides much opportunity for the other middle housing types listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4654)|
| 1:17:41| Triplexes, for example, are typically infeasible to build due to the added cost incurred by the switch from the residential to commercial building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4661)|
| 1:17:50| It is unclear from the data planning has released how many lots could support a quadplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4670)|
| 1:17:56| but it is a significantly smaller percentage than that for duplexes and triplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4676)|
| 1:18:03| The number of opportunities to build townhouses is even smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4683)|
| 1:18:08| You might argue that these housing types are currently permitted along the corridors, so why allow them to densify our neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4688)|
| 1:18:17| With a 70-foot height limit in the CG2, the highest and best use of these properties is within a completely different scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4697)|
| 1:18:25| Land values driven by this scale make building middle housing types here impractical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4705)|
| 1:18:31| Although I am sympathetic to various concerns regarding demolition or subdivision of existing homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4711)|
| 1:18:38| I don't think either of these situations will be cost effective and practical in most cases due to property acquisition, demolition, and construction costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4718)|
| 1:18:48| as well as modern building code requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| I'll let you run over on the first one a little bit, so if you could wrap up, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4730)|
| 1:18:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| Well, I suppose that can be wrapped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4738)|
| 1:19:02| There's a few more paragraphs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4742)|
| 1:19:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4744)|
| 1:19:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4747)|
| 1:19:08| Dustin Durham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4748)|
| 1:19:15| And then Mr. Sale will be next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| Dustin Durham, 1422 Cornelia Street, Apartment 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4758)|
| 1:19:23| And this is just a rehash of comments that I have left you all, so you should have these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| And I'll try to make it a crisp two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4768)|
| 1:19:32| So I'm here to speak in support of the proposed amendment from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4772)|
| 1:19:37| I won't get into the specifics because that's what you fine people are for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| But on the whole, I do believe that this is a proposal that is a critical first step in helping to remedy our housing crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4781)|
| 1:19:49| as well as allowing the necessary incremental increase in neighborhood density that's required for an effective and robust transit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4789)|
| 1:20:00| As a commissioner on the Knoxville Transportation Authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| I'm both proud and humbled to have been a part of the city's efforts to make CAT a better system for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4803)|
| 1:20:11| And the areas that have been chosen for the city's effort to start re-legalizing missing middle housing are primarily in neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4811)|
| 1:20:18| that will be a 10 minute or less walk to bus routes that will soon be 15 minutes, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4818)|
| 1:20:26| Transit systems like this will allow many people to live what I call a car light life, which is what I'm currently living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4826)|
| 1:20:34| which means that they can utilize their car as little as once a week, maybe less to do all of their errands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4834)|
| 1:20:40| Otherwise, they can walk, bike or use the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| Having neighborhoods like this not only allows us to begin to tackle the 50 percent plus of our community emissions that come from ground transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4843)|
| 1:20:51| but it allows us as citizens to better interact with our surroundings because we're no longer having to view our home from behind the isolated screen of a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4851)|
| 1:21:00| Better transportation systems allow for better community interaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| And in order to have better transportation systems, we have to have two things, more frequency in transit and better land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4865)|
| 1:21:12| We've done our job at the KTA in providing more frequency to these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| And now it is up to you as the planning commission to do your job and update the land uses to allow the needed density in these places to let our buses work well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4877)|
| 1:21:26| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4886)|
| 1:21:32| Hanson Sales 609 Weisgarber. I am here on behalf of the East Tennessee Realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| First, I just want to point out our association was proud to bring the idea of hiring off the coast design in the first place to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4897)|
| 1:21:46| A few years ago, and we just want to acknowledge that the plan that we had before us is extremely limited and will not do much to increase housing supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4906)|
| 1:21:55| And while we support missing middle, this ordinance really needs more time and attention, just as we did during recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4915)|
| 1:22:02| We're making one same mistake, the same mistake that left many of our historic neighborhoods legally nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4922)|
| 1:22:11| We picked dimensional standards out of thin air, not based on the existing lot sizes in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4931)|
| 1:22:17| And only this week, a month after this plan was first published, did we start doing an analysis of the existing vacant lots and whether they would work with the standards that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4937)|
| 1:22:30| That's the opposite way that we should be, and the OptiCoast report did recommend that we do it the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4950)|
| 1:22:36| Secondly, the missing middle report also identified parking requirements as a barrier to missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4956)|
| 1:22:43| The report recommended that we require no more than one parking space per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4963)|
| 1:22:48| In other words, one parking space is the maximum, yet this proposal makes one parking space our minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4968)|
| 1:22:57| Lastly, these standards haven't been tested in practice, something that the OptiCoast report also recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4977)|
| 1:23:06| And instead, today, the proposal that we have is untested standards that also exclude the possibility of seeking a variance through BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4986)|
| 1:23:16| which ultimately undermines the purpose of having a variance process in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=4996)|
| 1:23:22| We need more conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| This proposal is limited in its scope and also has some deficiencies that I think need to be addressed before we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5004)|
| 1:23:32| Because ultimately, if we want to see missing middle, we need a good plan and not just pass something because it makes us feel good, but something that will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5012)|
| 1:23:40| Thank you, Mr. Sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| Kathleen Moriarty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| Is she here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| She's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| Not here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| How about Ellen Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5033)|
| 1:24:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5043)|
| 1:24:04| I am Ellen Lee, and I live in 4th and Gill, and my family has lived in the house that I live in for over 130 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5044)|
| 1:24:15| So I can give you a first-hand perspective of how moving a single-family neighborhood into too many multi-unit structures affects the stewardship of a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5055)|
| 1:24:28| And that took 50 years, or over a half a decade, to reclaim the demise that it caused in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5068)|
| 1:24:40| And I hate to admit it, I was part of that year, but anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5080)|
| 1:24:46| I did come here today to let you be aware, to see if you were aware, that places like Northampton, Massachusetts, and other cities were using the infield guidelines that the Knoxville-Knox County Metropolitan Planning Commission and East Tennessee Design Center are using those to solve the problems of infield housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5086)|
| 1:25:15| That destroyed the character of their historic neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| Experts have noted, and we have already experienced, that multi-units often have a cookie-cutter look and enforce discontinuing and disarming neighborhoods, and take the harmony away from what the setting and the character is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5119)|
| 1:25:39| I'll put my glasses on so I can see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| I'm not totally against the missing middle concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5143)|
| 1:25:49| I think there's things that could work and help in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| I don't think that it is something that will help a historic overlay neighborhood in some of these older neighborhoods that have struggled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5153)|
| 1:26:05| A developer may put more money in their pocket, but we as a city revitalizing old neighborhoods can create a real problem of squashing a sustainable revitalization if we implement a missing middle type plan that would cause a decline in the desirability of young families to invest in the areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5165)|
| 1:26:31| The young families are what have built our neighborhood back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5191)|
| 1:26:35| I know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| I lived it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5196)|
| 1:26:37| I used to beg my parents to move out, and then I moved back to Tent Knoxville and moved back in because families were coming back to the neighborhood, kids going up and down the street in their buggies and their bicycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5197)|
| 1:26:51| That came from single-family ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| Thank you, Ms. Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| I'll give you a little grace on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| I'll give you a little extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| Mr. Bob Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5224)|
| 1:27:20| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| My name is Bob Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| I live at 1015 Luttrell Street in the 4th and Gill neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5242)|
| 1:27:25| I've been there for the last 43 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| We made a huge transition from a run-down, beat-up place that they drove the interstate through to where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5247)|
| 1:27:35| So I'm here speaking with a lot of experience and speaking from the heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| First thing I want to do is thank you all for taking the time to serve on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| There's a lot of hard work that has to go through here, and you all have heard a lot of stuff today, the stuff on Marble Alley, a lot of focus on one little small area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5261)|
| 1:27:51| What you're being asked to look at by the city today is a rezoning of 26% of the properties in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5271)|
| 1:27:57| They don't call it a rezoning, but the land use regulations for 26% of the people in the city are going to change as this ordinance is put into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5277)|
| 1:28:06| And I'm speaking just for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| There are neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| I have a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| One in particular thinks this is a pretty good plan, but that'd be the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5290)|
| 1:28:15| But I'm here for myself today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| And I'm okay with on vacant lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| If this is going to happen on vacant lots, I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| And in 4th and Gill, that would add 10 to 12 potential more units than the zoning already allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5303)|
| 1:28:29| But it also puts the other 280 historic properties at risk for the conversions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5309)|
| 1:28:35| Not worried about the demolitions, but the conversions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| It's happened in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| It happened in the middle of the last century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| It took us 50 years to work our way back out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| We are very concerned about going down that road again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| My wife is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| A number of people I've talked to are very, very concerned about that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| We're also concerned about the issue of sharing the burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| That the downtown neighborhoods, us, Park Ridge, Old North, and Lonsdale, Mechanicsville, we're the ones being asked to share it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5335)|
| 1:29:04| The most dense areas of the city are the ones who are being asked to share the burden of solving the housing problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5344)|
| 1:29:11| while the least dense parts of the city are not being asked to share in that burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| So that seems to be an equity issue to me that needs to be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5355)|
| 1:29:19| And thirdly, this whole thing seems to be on a bit of a rocket docket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5359)|
| 1:29:24| I know from the inside, if you're on the inside, it doesn't seem like one, but from the outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| there were two public hearings a couple of weeks ago that goes to city council, and now it comes here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5367)|
| 1:29:33| and you guys are meeting a week early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| I would say we just need to slow down just a little bit and talk some more about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| and see if there's not a way to get to where everybody wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| I know our neighborhood is very supportive of the idea of multifamily housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5382)|
| 1:29:47| We have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5387)|
| 1:29:48| And if more of it hadn't, we just had eight townhomes built on Fourth Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5388)|
| 1:29:52| Y'all ought to get over and take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| That's what missing middle is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| And by the way, those units sold, average price, $355,000 per unit for 1,100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5396)|
| 1:30:04| So that's the kind of units that you're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| And as far as the conversions are getting too expensive, that may be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| I have a sense it may be true, but I'd certainly like some documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| or as the guy from Realtor said, we need to test these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| We need to be testing this and talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| So anyway, those are my three concerns, and I would just ask that y'all postpone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5420)|
| 1:30:26| and we spend more time talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| And I heard Cheryl say that they'd be here in a couple of months with a more comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5428)|
| 1:30:34| Seems like we ought to be talking comprehensively rather than nitpicking it along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5434)|
| 1:30:38| So those are my words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5438)|
| 1:30:39| Thank y'all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| Thank you, Mr. Wessel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5441)|
| 1:30:47| Mr. Bentley Marlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5447)|
| 1:30:53| Eric, could we pull up page 4 of my comment as a modified table 4.4, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5453)|
| 1:31:20| Is there another voice we could hear from while we're waiting on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| Scroll down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| Down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5489)|
| 1:31:30| Down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5490)|
| 1:31:31| Table 4-4, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| Yes, that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5494)|
| 1:31:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5495)|
| 1:31:36| Okay, so I'm Bentley Marlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| I live at 322 Douglas Avenue over in Mechanicsville, which is one of the older cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| older neighborhoods in the city, and part of the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| And I, like Hanson, am very concerned that some of these lot widths are just made up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| I've spent a great deal of time studying this over the last 20 years, both as a builder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5511)|
| 1:31:56| started as just fixing my own house and fixing my neighbor's houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| and ultimately owning a significant part of Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5519)|
| 1:32:03| And I can tell you that the city's proposed lot widths create a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5523)|
| 1:32:08| The data that Amy just sent me right before this meeting evidences that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| I went to the actual book written by the principal founder of Optikos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5533)|
| 1:32:18| studied the scan report for Knoxville, Athens, Georgia, Greenville, South Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| and the preliminary version of one out of somewhere in North Carolina that Optikos has been hired to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5542)|
| 1:32:28| And I've come up with the numbers that are actually documented by Optikos as working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| And if you just look at it quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| notice that the city's proposal for duplex sub-side and duplex stack, same width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5556)|
| 1:32:41| but we're stacking the duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| Why does it need the lot the same width?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| If you notice, Optikos never makes a distinction between lot sizes for triplex and fourplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5565)|
| 1:32:50| Nonetheless, the city decided to widen the fourplex requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| and that 55 foot makes it inapplicable to most of the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5574)|
| 1:32:59| So what are we actually trying to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| The city down at multiplex, and I've discussed this with Brian Berry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| and they did make a modification there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| I think the city's revised numbers take it from 80 to 100 down to 70 to 85 maybe, Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5587)|
| 1:33:16| Optikos report says 65 to 70 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| And if you go down to the next page, Optikos identifies other types of missing middle housing styles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5600)|
| 1:33:25| the multiplex large, the cottage courtyard, and then the carriage house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| And I find it curious that the city's presentation, each of their illustrations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| all documented, the drawings on all the city's websites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| there's a carriage house with duplexes, triplexes in their drawings, yet they excluded those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5617)|
| 1:33:44| So I would say that we should be more true to the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| We hired them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| We've listened to their report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| We've had their presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5630)|
| 1:33:51| They know what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5631)|
| 1:33:52| They're doing this nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| The table I've proposed as an alternative here is true to their reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| and their studies nationwide in cities like ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| Deb Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5645)|
| 1:34:24| Thank you for allowing me to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| I don't want to try to duplicate what other people have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| and I spent most of the meeting trying to cut down what I have to say also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| I served my neighborhood organization, Oakwood Lincoln Park, for over five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| and was president during RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| This is a good beginning for some of the middle housing stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| There are great details in the plans for setbacks and blending with existing housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| I think there's a lot more details that need to be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| Neighbors repeatedly quested are into zoning during RECODE, so that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5690)|
| 1:34:58| In contrast to the RECODE, the city had two meetings for this issue for the impacted areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5698)|
| 1:35:05| none in Edgewood, Mechanicsville, Beaumont, or Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5705)|
| 1:35:09| The pictures presented were a vague map with illegible color codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| on an eight-and-a-half by 11-inch sheet of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| They've chosen moderate-income neighborhoods where they expect less pushback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| The other two neighborhoods, Old North and Fourth and Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| have historic overlay protection, which protects them from demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| There was mention of demolition and how it's not feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| I studied our neighborhood and walked it for a potential feasible historic overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| that would have allowed vinyl, siding, and windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| We've had multiple partial and complete demolitions, even in the last five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| over 20 in the last 20 years, half of them from the city, so just keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5746)|
| 1:35:51| Other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| There hasn't been sufficient notice, which was already mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| If proceeding, the city needs to be a citywide effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| and include all neighborhoods as well as RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| Council members mentioned this at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| That takes a little bit of the pressure off of these already very dense neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| Oakwood, Lincoln Park, Lonsdale, Edgewood are the heart of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| We receive infill design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| These neighborhoods need demolition protection, not necessarily historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| Yes, we have bus routes, but most households have two or more cars on a 50-foot-wide lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5778)|
| 1:36:24| and may not have a driveway or alley access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| Adding duplexes adds more vehicles, which stresses drainage issues and on-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5787)|
| 1:36:32| There's no protections to ensure that housing that is built or added onto will be affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5792)|
| 1:36:37| The point of RECODE was to revitalize commercial areas with mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| Utilize this first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| Don't throw existing neighborhoods under the bus route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| Established neighborhood residents have nowhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| This will not help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| An advocate from Nashville said to do everything you can to keep people where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| Five years ago, there were 20 empty houses within a block of my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| Now there are three or four rehabbed houses that are either second houses or Airbnbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| So what can officials do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| Tax Airbnb at a higher rate, particularly if not occupied by an owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| Other cities are changing their Airbnb regulations to accommodate housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| Only allow the new regulations to take place on the empty lots already mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| Give protection from demolition to heart of Knoxville neighborhoods, similar to the historic neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| Guarantee affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| Expand the zone to all neighborhoods, including RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| Hire more planners, inspectors, and codes enforcement officers to deal with our growing city and increased tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5847)|
| 1:37:35| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| We need more time on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5856)|
| 1:37:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| Mr. Gordon Coker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5860)|
| 1:37:48| Gordon Coker, 1000 Eleanor Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5868)|
| 1:37:56| I think everything has been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| I'm actually agreeing with the gentleman from the Realtor Association, which I can't quite believe, that we need a delay on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5879)|
| 1:38:09| I went to both meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| I read the Opticos report twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| It's very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| I didn't know anything about the conversion aspect of it until the public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5898)|
| 1:38:26| I have no problem with building along the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| I have no problem with infill housing, with the guidelines that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| But I do have a problem with conversion factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| We, in the early 90s, we went from R2, R2A, whatever, to R1A at the request of the Planning Commission at that time to preserve the housing stock of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5918)|
| 1:38:53| And now we're going the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| And so I think we need to slow down a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5935)|
| 1:38:59| I'm asking for a delay on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| And so maybe neighbors can get a little bit more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5942)|
| 1:39:08| I think it's been too fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5950)|
| 1:39:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5951)|
| 1:39:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| Thank you, everyone, for speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| A couple questions for maybe Director Brooks or staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5972)|
| 1:39:37| When it comes to the conversion guideline or part of this, without the conversion part of this, would a homeowner within this proposal still be able to do a conversion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5977)|
| 1:39:59| To say from a single family to a duplex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| They would need to follow the base standards, is how I would interpret this, of the code, rather than take advantage of the middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6004)|
| 1:40:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| And so the base standards don't have the design guideline part that's in the missing middle proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6017)|
| 1:40:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| They don't have the design, the dimensional standards, and also the development types would be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6031)|
| 1:40:32| So by having a conversion part of this missing middle, in my mind, that helps protect the appearance of what those homes look like currently, as opposed to doing whatever, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6032)|
| 1:40:48| That was the intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| When it comes to the lot width requirements, I want to make sure I understand the 20% variance that can be, I guess, sort of staff reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6052)|
| 1:41:04| So, for example, if it were a 45-foot lot, that would be 20% of the 45 feet, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6064)|
| 1:41:16| So nine feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6076)|
| 1:41:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6077)|
| 1:41:18| So that would mean that you could do this on a 36-foot wide lot, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6078)|
| 1:41:24| And so that 20% goes all the way up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| Some of these types require an 80-foot lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6087)|
| 1:41:32| That would be up to a 16-foot reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| So you could actually have a 64-foot wide lot, theoretically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6097)|
| 1:41:44| So I think that a better way to address, and I think that gives quite a bit of variance to address the lot sizes that we have that go all the way from really, you know, a bulk of them being 40 feet at the small end all the way up to, you know, 50 to 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6104)|
| 1:42:05| I think there's a lot of leeway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| If we were to look at adjusting lot sizes, I'd be more comfortable increasing the variance amount from, say, 20% to 25% that staff can review to make sure that that fits within the neighborhood as opposed to just blanket adjusting all of the lot widths that they would then have by right to make sure that, you know, a multiplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6129)|
| 1:42:32| Theoretically, you could maybe have a multiplex right next to a whole row of single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| And if staff can review that and say, no, that doesn't quite fit there if they have a little more leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| So if we are going to look at changing that, I think that would be a better approach than a blanket table change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6161)|
| 1:42:52| You know, in terms of some of the other public comments, I think that, you know, the TDR plan or land use classification is something that the city and planning has undergone looking at what our city has in terms of traditional neighborhoods being having alleys or sidewalks, increasing density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6172)|
| 1:43:19| Those types of amenities really fit well with increasing density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| So I understand the market conditions and the importance of increasing housing supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6203)|
| 1:43:30| But I also think that, you know, we've got multiple sides here saying, you know, this is too much, some saying this is too little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6210)|
| 1:43:40| I really think approaching TDR is maybe kind of the right middle ground to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6220)|
| 1:43:46| And it's not necessarily about sharing the burden of, you know, making more suburban areas have some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6226)|
| 1:43:54| It's just they don't have the capability to increase that density in a manner that we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6234)|
| 1:44:01| I think we would have worse unintended consequences if we did that immediately without seeing how things would play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6241)|
| 1:44:11| Additionally, when it comes to, you know, our commercial corridors and, you know, recodes goal of allowing mixed use and housing on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6251)|
| 1:44:23| I mean, that's the problem of the market determining, you know, how much land goes for in commercially zoned areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6263)|
| 1:44:30| You're always going to have a really tough time when there's a really higher and better use or a potentially higher and better use of, you know, a retail chain store company able to come in and basically demand a really high land price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6270)|
| 1:44:46| So in terms of where residential currently is, I think this is a really great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6286)|
| 1:44:54| I fully support it. And, you know, I'll be voting in favor of this for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6294)|
| 1:45:03| So thank you. Thank you. Commissioner Higgins. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| And I, too, want to say I appreciate all the speakers that we had today and all the opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6307)|
| 1:45:14| And I think that it's really interesting that we saw such a wide variety of opinions on this of, you know, some in complete opposition and thinking that this is the wrong approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6314)|
| 1:45:26| And some saying that this is spot on and exactly what we need and some saying we're not going far enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6326)|
| 1:45:32| And frankly, I agree that this has got to be just the first step because there we do need to go further and we do need more housing options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6332)|
| 1:45:43| And, you know, it was nice to hear from neighbors that live in these areas, because what's interesting is these are some of our, you know, our historic neighborhoods that are some of the most desired neighborhoods and have incredible values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6343)|
| 1:46:02| And they are the ones that were built on what we are trying to now bring back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6362)|
| 1:46:08| So, you know, the historic character of those neighborhoods like 4th and Gill is full of small instances of missing middle housing that I think really brings that character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6368)|
| 1:46:18| So I'm excited to see, you know, once hopefully if we are able to move forward with more missing middle options, how that will continue to grow the other neighborhoods in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6378)|
| 1:46:33| But, you know, there's a saying that a good compromise is no one is left happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6393)|
| 1:46:41| And I think that this is a really good start and a good compromise for starting to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6401)|
| 1:46:50| And so, you know, even though I agree that we should be including R1 areas, I think we should also be giving more leeway to the dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6410)|
| 1:47:01| And, you know, there's a lot more that we can be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| And I think I hope that we the city will continue to pursue more of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| And there was a, you know, the Realtors Association mentioned the trying to try out some of the practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6430)|
| 1:47:19| And I know this wasn't the intention of that comment, but I do think that if this is a start, this is a good opportunity for us to see how these end up playing out, how these new allowances play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6439)|
| 1:47:33| And then there's also been a lot of comments about increasing density along the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6453)|
| 1:47:38| And I think if you look at the map that's on the screen right now, you'll notice that the corridors are not really highlighted in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6458)|
| 1:47:47| The areas directly along the corridors are kind of left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| And the reason for that is the corridors have already have a commercial zoning, which most of those commercial zonings allow for multifamily housing, you know, options and different mixes of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6472)|
| 1:48:05| So we already have the opportunities on the corridor. We need to look at these other areas of opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6485)|
| 1:48:12| So I support this. I would not be in support of postponing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6492)|
| 1:48:18| I think that, again, if we really want to start making changes and impacting where we're growing in terms of improving our housing stock and options, we need to start getting things in code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6498)|
| 1:48:34| And then we this is this is an example of responding to recode with adjustments and coming back and adding other things like we will continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6514)|
| 1:48:44| So I hope that a better tweaks will come of this as it in the coming months and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6524)|
| 1:48:52| But I really think that this is an incredible first start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6532)|
| 1:48:56| And I applaud staff and the city for working so hard and putting this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6536)|
| 1:49:05| Thank you, Commissioner Higgins. I think as far as the inside the commercial corridors, I think some people intend or their desire is to see a policy from the city that would promote development in the commercial corridors where it may not make economic sense on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6545)|
| 1:49:28| Maybe some public-private policy partnerships, such as the only thing we've seen in the commercial corridors are really projects supported by tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6568)|
| 1:49:39| And so maybe some of the pilot policies, I think that's some of the been pretty wide conversation about those commercial corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6579)|
| 1:49:51| And I think many people are kind of inferring that we look at that as a potential kickstart to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6591)|
| 1:49:59| But appreciate your comments. Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6599)|
| 1:50:05| I just want to pick up on what you were saying about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| And I am assuming that in Miss Ball's comments about a comprehensive plan coming later, that that is the kind of stuff that we can start to anticipate coming our way as part of a holistic sort of filling of all the all of the arrows in the quiver for ways to address the crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6608)|
| 1:50:29| That's what I'm hoping for. And I am. I concur with Commissioner Higgins and Commissioner Seltzer about this being a really good first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6629)|
| 1:50:40| It's not perfect. And I think the fact that we've got all these voices today speaking to different push pulls like too fast, too slow, you know, more or less like I think that tells us that it's not perfect, but we're getting a lot closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6640)|
| 1:50:54| And I am not in favor of postponing. I think that we we've got a really good template here to move forward with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6654)|
| 1:51:00| I have one question, though, and that is because almost everyone has said, yes, this looks, you know, whether they're completely in favor or in favor with some compromise or some changes, there is a desire to keep working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6660)|
| 1:51:17| And I think that it is a struggle for this body, all of the bodies to get back to it. So I'm looking for some guidance from planning about how can we in the proposal that we have today include some type of confirmed return so that we could come back to this in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6677)|
| 1:51:44| I'm not sure what the magic amount of time is, but to get a real report on, okay, we've been doing this for this period of time. What has worked? What has not worked? What do we want to adjust? But to hold ourselves accountable, just like we would if we were piloting some new software or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6704)|
| 1:52:02| We would get back to it and look at it and then make it better. So can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6722)|
| 1:52:09| Yes, of course. Thank you, Commissioner Adams, for bringing that up. I think it's within this body's purview to direct staff within the next year or at the end of 12 months that you would like a report back on just exactly what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6729)|
| 1:52:24| What has worked well? What would we recommend for improvements? What have we been hearing? And then you could even open it up to the public and invite additional comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6744)|
| 1:52:34| Is that something that needs to be included in this proposal, or are you saying that that's something that the Commission would need to bring up itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6754)|
| 1:52:43| I think stating it on the record is enough to put it on our work program for something like this. The recommendation before you is specific to code amendments, and I would say that type of recommendation doesn't go into a code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6763)|
| 1:52:57| So as long as I've stated it out loud, it's on the record. I would like to make a motion to approve this. It's a bit different than how we typically look at a case, so I'm not exactly sure how to say that appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6777)|
| 1:53:14| But if I can make a move to approve the amendment to the Knoxville City Code as outlined in 10B2308, if that's an appropriate way to phrase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6794)|
| 1:53:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| Okay, we have a motion to approve per the recommendation by Commissioner Adams, seconded by Commissioner Higgins. Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6810)|
| 1:53:43| In the same vein of Commissioner Adams' questioning and thinking, I'm just curious if as part of our learning process, if the recommendations as part of this missing middle proposal included lessons learned from other cities that have maybe done similar programs before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6823)|
| 1:54:00| and what the impacts have been on conversions and demolitions specifically, since that was kind of an off-sided concern. Do we know anything about maybe other comparable cities and what the results have been of programs that might be a year or two ahead of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6840)|
| 1:54:17| That's a great question. We don't currently have that prepared. We'd be happy to reach out and compile that for you. That was a question that came up during the council workshop as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6857)|
| 1:54:29| Commissioner Schell, are you done? Commissioner Biggs? Okay. Commissioner Schelso?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6869)|
| 1:54:40| This that was handed out to us, about 46E, I think there were a couple of last-minute changes from what's on our agenda and on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6880)|
| 1:54:53| I think after reading these, we want to incorporate that in what we send on to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6893)|
| 1:55:00| That would be great. Thank you for bringing that up. It was something that staff wanted to call to your attention. It's section 4.6E. We have additional copies that we can pass out. It's really an attempt at some clarification of language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6900)|
| 1:55:15| If you all don't mind passing that down. My assumption was that was part of what I was approving in my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6915)|
| 1:55:26| Okay. We just need it. We should read it into the record. Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6926)|
| 1:55:33| That's all I had. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| Commissioner Huber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| Yes, so this is a tough one because it does seem to be moving pretty fast on one hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6940)|
| 1:55:47| On the other hand, just like the gentleman said, it has had a lot of internal look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6947)|
| 1:55:55| I don't think it goes far enough. I am on board with moving it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6955)|
| 1:56:02| However, I do think it's imperative that we do go back and look at it intently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6962)|
| 1:56:09| Mr. Marlowe has had a lot of really good suggestions that aren't necessarily being adopted in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6969)|
| 1:56:17| He's the one out there, boots on the ground, doing these things every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6977)|
| 1:56:21| I have a lot of respect for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6981)|
| 1:56:26| Again, in R1, we're talking about R2, R3, and R4 in these certain areas, but we're leaving out R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6986)|
| 1:56:35| From a strict infill situation, I think there's no reason to not include R1, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=6995)|
| 1:56:43| Even there, I think we need to look further outside of the TDR areas to keep it moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7003)|
| 1:56:51| because there's a lot of opportunity in more of the greenfield areas of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| to increase some of the housing in appropriate areas in the right ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7015)|
| 1:57:00| I just wanted to reiterate, I think it needs to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7020)|
| 1:57:05| but I wholeheartedly think it needs to be reviewed again sometime probably in the next 12 months to see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7025)|
| 1:57:13| Thank you. Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| I would have to say that I think we are moving quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7036)|
| 1:57:21| I think it's a little premature for a strategic plan to be put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7041)|
| 1:57:28| It may seem fast on the outside, it seems fast on the inside to me as well, Mr. Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7048)|
| 1:57:39| I heard the pros and cons, as Commissioner Higgins mentioned and Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7059)|
| 1:57:45| What I heard were a lot of cons from residents who were right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7065)|
| 1:57:51| I heard pros from non-residents who were advocating for a policy change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7071)|
| 1:57:57| I think everyone agrees that this needs to be thoughtfully done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7077)|
| 1:58:04| I don't think there's anyone who thinks that this is an issue that does not need more attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7084)|
| 1:58:12| I just think when you talk about strategy and thoughtful consideration of what and how should be included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7092)|
| 1:58:22| and also for quite broad, meaningful concern, I think to Mr. Wetzel's 26% was a figure you used of impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7102)|
| 1:58:42| 280 historic homes at risk for conversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7122)|
| 1:58:47| I think sometimes we do go quickly and we don't consider the impact, the risks associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7127)|
| 1:58:52| What are we trading off? What are the consequences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7132)|
| 1:58:56| I think that we need to go back through those steps, not to say that we won't end up at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7136)|
| 1:59:03| but I think we will have done it in more of a consensus basis with a lot more communication and a lot more input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7143)|
| 1:59:10| I respect the research that's been done so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| or certain things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7154)|
| 1:59:16| I just think more needs to go into it for the tiny impact that it even covers, the tiny number of lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7156)|
| 1:59:22| but then also the conversion possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7162)|
| 1:59:26| I know the individual didn't get to be here, Christina Bowler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7166)|
| 1:59:30| but I think she had a lot of great points that were read into the record, and I appreciated those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7170)|
| 1:59:37| So I just wanted to make those comments, not against having the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7177)|
| 1:59:41| but it's hard to hand out something and vote on it also and then say we also need more review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7181)|
| 1:59:49| I think that that time for review is before we pass something and then have unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7189)|
| 1:59:56| Thank you, Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7196)|
| 1:59:59| Ms. Ball, I have a couple of questions for you, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7199)|
| 2:00:05| One is I understand the limited rollout here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7205)|
| 2:00:09| Is the long-term plan to roll this out also into RN1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7209)|
| 2:00:15| That's a really great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7215)|
| 2:00:17| I think that at this juncture the plan is to see how the reaction is to this portion of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7217)|
| 2:00:25| and we do not currently have a specific plan to roll this out into RN1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7225)|
| 2:00:32| but that does not mean that it is off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7232)|
| 2:00:36| We haven't gone there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| We felt like this was a really good, important first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7238)|
| 2:00:43| A couple of the additional steps that we do sort of have a specific interest in is pursuing some of the additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7243)|
| 2:00:50| types of missing middle housing and appropriate locations for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7250)|
| 2:00:56| We had talked before about the idea of a pre-approved plan book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7256)|
| 2:01:01| and that's something we're also really interested in pursuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| That's very difficult to do until you have the guardrails that this particular set of this proposal puts forward first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7264)|
| 2:01:12| That sort of has to be the first step before we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| So I don't know that that's specifically on or off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7275)|
| 2:01:19| I think it's one of those things that could become on the table but is not maybe at present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7279)|
| 2:01:27| So is it fair to say that if, say, the rollout went reasonably well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7287)|
| 2:01:32| that stand to reason it would expand into RN1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7292)|
| 2:01:37| I don't know that we have vetted that particular zoning as a part of this planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7297)|
| 2:01:47| and so I'm hesitant to say yes because I do think that it requires that vetting process that we have gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7307)|
| 2:01:54| and that Opti-Coast also went through with us, and that was not a part of that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7314)|
| 2:02:00| I could see being in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7320)|
| 2:02:04| However, I've heard a lot, just like Commissioner Boyer had communicated, and from residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7324)|
| 2:02:12| and I heard too much, too little, and too fast, but I didn't hear too slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7332)|
| 2:02:20| And I am a little concerned because there are some components of this that I'm not sure has been vetted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7340)|
| 2:02:29| in the sense that, one, I don't think we have broadly applied these types to the existing properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7349)|
| 2:02:39| We have applied some, but I don't think we've done it broadly or maybe sufficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7359)|
| 2:02:45| Secondly, I heard from some BikeWalk representatives, I think, or folks that were with BikeWalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7365)|
| 2:02:52| and I'm really surprised that we didn't talk about removing parking minimums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7372)|
| 2:02:59| When you look at, I looked at the urban zoning overlay in Nashville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7379)|
| 2:03:05| and if there's ever a poster child community for this type of development, it's probably 12 Avenue South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7385)|
| 2:03:14| And 12 Avenue South, as I understood what they did, they took their minimums, parking minimums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7394)|
| 2:03:23| and made them maximums and removed their parking minimums for a number of good reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7403)|
| 2:03:29| One is on-street parking slows traffic speed, and it also protects pedestrians on sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7409)|
| 2:03:39| and in many cases, bikers in bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7419)|
| 2:03:43| And so I just wonder, has there been any conversation about that, and where do we stand on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7423)|
| 2:03:49| and why didn't we have it in this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7429)|
| 2:03:53| There was extensive conversation, and we do agree that parking on the street is traffic calming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7433)|
| 2:04:01| and it does make streets easier and safer for pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7441)|
| 2:04:05| I don't think we disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| Our current code requires two parking spaces per unit in our current code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7446)|
| 2:04:13| and we made the decision to cut that in half, and for Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7453)|
| 2:04:20| and the comments that we were being very aggressively pushed, we had a stakeholder event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7460)|
| 2:04:29| and when Opti-Coast was in town, and every single person that made a comment at that event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7469)|
| 2:04:38| was telling us do not decrease parking standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7478)|
| 2:04:42| We have. We've cut it in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7482)|
| 2:04:45| For Knoxville, we felt like that was a really aggressive and good first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7485)|
| 2:04:51| for moving forward with this particular proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7491)|
| 2:04:57| I think, and I could be recollecting inaccurately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7497)|
| 2:05:00| but I think Opti-Coast maybe commented that that could be the barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7500)|
| 2:05:06| when you apply the parking minimums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7506)|
| 2:05:11| When we had our additional consultation with Opti-Coast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7511)|
| 2:05:15| because of the specific housing types that we're selecting and the geography that we have selected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7515)|
| 2:05:22| he agreed with us that one parking space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| Tony Perez agreed that one parking space per unit was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7525)|
| 2:05:29| Some of the larger types in particular, there's a lot more opportunity to reduce that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7529)|
| 2:05:38| and he also agreed with the idea of taking an incremental approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7538)|
| 2:05:43| to moving forward with missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7543)|
| 2:05:47| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7547)|
| 2:05:48| Is it fair to say that maybe these TDR communities were probably many designed or built pre-vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7548)|
| 2:05:56| so they may not be really, were retrofitting cars basically is what we're doing into these communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7556)|
| 2:06:03| Is that a fair comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7563)|
| 2:06:07| I would say yes, but I want to be very clear that that is not my area of expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7567)|
| 2:06:13| and I would probably want to default to the planning staff on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7573)|
| 2:06:18| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7578)|
| 2:06:19| I am not in opposition of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7579)|
| 2:06:22| I could very likely support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7582)|
| 2:06:24| I am really concerned that we may not have vetted this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7584)|
| 2:06:30| You typically want to draw it before you build it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7590)|
| 2:06:34| and I'm just concerned that I don't see how a little more planning could hurt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7594)|
| 2:06:42| and I'm not trying to thwart your motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7602)|
| 2:06:45| but I would certainly be open to some level of postponement if this doesn't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7605)|
| 2:06:53| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7615)|
| 2:06:56| I have a couple additional comments and some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7616)|
| 2:07:00| Two things I want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7620)|
| 2:07:02| When I was referring to the corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7622)|
| 2:07:04| I've heard comments that a higher density or missing metal should only be allowed in the corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7624)|
| 2:07:11| and so that's more specifically what I was referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7631)|
| 2:07:14| I'd also like to clarify that a high number of the people that we heard from today in support are neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7634)|
| 2:07:22| I see a whole section over there of people that spoke and mentioned that they live in these areas and a few others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7642)|
| 2:07:32| So I think more than half of who we heard from who said that this is on the right track and this is good were neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7652)|
| 2:07:40| So I want to clarify and point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| And then in regards to some of the comments that have come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7662)|
| 2:07:49| I would be in favor of the parking minimum going down being lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7669)|
| 2:07:57| I would be in favor of the lot width minimums being lower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| and I do think that this will does need more refining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7680)|
| 2:08:06| but I don't think that keeping it in a back and forth the ping pong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7686)|
| 2:08:10| I want to I'd like to see it in practice and see it get implemented and then also be a living document that we can adjust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7690)|
| 2:08:22| To Commissioner Adams point, I think that reviewing it again later for adjustments is a good approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7702)|
| 2:08:30| So I really wouldn't want to hold it up because, you know, in processes like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7710)|
| 2:08:38| we could we could spend the next decade talking about this and refining it and changing it every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7718)|
| 2:08:46| And we would still go to take a vote in 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7726)|
| 2:08:50| And half the people would be happy with it. And half the people would be upset with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7730)|
| 2:08:57| And, you know, we're we're trying to respond to something that's been a longstanding issue and a very high need that the nation as a whole is trying to respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7737)|
| 2:09:08| And that's the need for more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7748)|
| 2:09:10| So I think that I agree that we should continue to improve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7750)|
| 2:09:18| but I don't think that we should prevent implementing it in order to continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7758)|
| 2:09:25| So thank you, Commissioner Levinson. I feel it needs a lot of work and I wouldn't be opposed to sending it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7765)|
| 2:09:36| But I do believe, you know, you've got to eat the elephant one bite at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7776)|
| 2:09:41| But, you know, waiting a year in order to hear how we're doing, in my opinion, is not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7781)|
| 2:09:53| If we're going to do it, you've got to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7793)|
| 2:09:57| And I guess my questions are is, you know, have we approached this? Have we approached people that are going to be involved in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7797)|
| 2:10:08| Because those are the people who we have to be concerned with right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7808)|
| 2:10:13| Are there any incentives for people to come into the city and absorb these properties and make them into the middle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7813)|
| 2:10:21| My problem is, is I don't know how they can be in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7821)|
| 2:10:25| With the costs of building and the costs of everything, I mean, these are all going to still be really expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7825)|
| 2:10:33| So I guess as I look at it is there's a whole lot of work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7833)|
| 2:10:40| And I think that a lot of the time that the city needs to do is to find the people that are going to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7840)|
| 2:10:49| and figure out what they need in order to accomplish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| I've heard all this today, and it's really neat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7852)|
| 2:10:56| I'm really for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7856)|
| 2:10:58| But it's all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7858)|
| 2:11:01| It's more than I can absorb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| God only knows how you all are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7863)|
| 2:11:06| So I feel we should move forward, but I'm not for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7866)|
| 2:11:13| I'm more like, let's see what we do in the first quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7873)|
| 2:11:17| I want to hear who we're taking this to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7877)|
| 2:11:21| I want to hear how this is going to be successful, not just, well, here's some games to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7881)|
| 2:11:29| It's time to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7889)|
| 2:11:32| And it isn't going to be a year from now, if I may put that in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7892)|
| 2:11:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7898)|
| 2:11:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7899)|
| 2:11:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7900)|
| 2:11:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7901)|
| 2:11:42| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7902)|
| 2:11:46| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7906)|
| 2:11:47| I just wanted to, I guess, reiterate that I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7907)|
| 2:11:52| Can you bring your mic closer, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7912)|
| 2:11:54| I'm giving permission to touch the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7914)|
| 2:12:00| I think that the approach that the city has taken and that planning has taken with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7920)|
| 2:12:06| is to look at where is the greatest likelihood for success for the first foray into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7926)|
| 2:12:13| and to say that by doing that, we then are able to develop some very successful models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7933)|
| 2:12:21| Because I think a lot of what we hear right now is fear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7941)|
| 2:12:25| fear because we don't have a lot of models to point to of this is how this worked really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7945)|
| 2:12:30| But if we are able to move forward with this, then we have paved a road to potentially have those models| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7950)|
| 2:12:38| and say, well, this is how it works well, and then build upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7958)|
| 2:12:43| Because I think everyone agrees this is not the whole solution, to your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7963)|
| 2:12:49| But if we start now, we can continue getting all of these other ideas in that start working on corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7969)|
| 2:12:56| that start working on other areas that have models that can be pointed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7976)|
| 2:13:00| Okay, this is what works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7980)|
| 2:13:02| So that is where my feeling of this is we need to go ahead and start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7982)|
| 2:13:08| Let's get it rolling, and then let's return to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7988)|
| 2:13:12| and make sure that we are using those models and building on the best ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7992)|
| 2:13:18| Commissioner Adams, I would comment that we do have a, I thought I cited a good model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=7998)|
| 2:13:24| and that's why I pause and say are we following that very model, which is 12 Avenue South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8004)|
| 2:13:32| So that's, I think a little more time wouldn't hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8012)|
| 2:13:36| I don't have a strong opinion, but I just don't see how it could hurt to take a closer look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8016)|
| 2:13:43| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| I am not as familiar with 12 Avenue South as you are, but what I hear is that's Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8025)|
| 2:13:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8033)|
| 2:13:54| And that this is Knoxville, and that there's been a request to look at other cities and those successful cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8034)|
| 2:14:00| and I think we can always learn from what other communities are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8040)|
| 2:14:05| But one of the things I appreciate in what Ms. Ball said was that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8045)|
| 2:14:10| Opticos and some other voices were saying, hey, throw the ball further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8050)|
| 2:14:14| and that this proposal is saying we're really not sure that that toss is where we are right now as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8054)|
| 2:14:21| So they have taken those recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8061)|
| 2:14:24| and worked with those to put something together that could work for Knoxville right now, but to build on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8064)|
| 2:14:32| And that's where I think you start to get into other communities and can pull that in later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8072)|
| 2:14:39| But at the moment, I don't know if it's the right first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8079)|
| 2:14:43| That would be my answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8083)|
| 2:14:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8085)|
| 2:14:46| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| The great thing about a long meeting is you can do research during it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8088)|
| 2:14:53| To some of your points that you brought up, which I think are good things to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8093)|
| 2:14:58| 12 Avenue South has a really good corridor plan specific just to 12 Avenue South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8098)|
| 2:15:04| And those are the types of things I know we've looked at in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8104)|
| 2:15:09| And so maybe that's kind of a next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8109)|
| 2:15:12| And this is sort of, in my opinion, this is a policy that's just supposed to be a little bit more broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8112)|
| 2:15:17| No, this one, I just cited 12 Avenue South, but the urban zoning overlay actually encompasses their traditional neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8117)|
| 2:15:26| And I see that as probably the next step where this should go as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8126)|
| 2:15:33| In looking at R and 1, R and 1 looks like it accounts for 9% of the lots within TDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8133)|
| 2:15:41| but it only accounts for 0.62 of the vacant lots within TDR, about 53 vacant lots, maybe it's 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8141)|
| 2:15:50| So I don't see that impact being huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8150)|
| 2:15:53| And one reason I would be hesitant to include R and 1 is I think that would make it more difficult to easily expand this policy without having to go back and fix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8153)|
| 2:16:06| okay, well, if we're going to take this outside of 640, is R and 1 appropriate for some of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8166)|
| 2:16:12| Maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8172)|
| 2:16:13| That's where more neighborhood-focused plans, I think, would be appropriate with the use of an overlay to expand it instead of just a TDR or a land-use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8173)|
| 2:16:24| And so I think excluding R and 1 right now makes sense with the plan that's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8184)|
| 2:16:28| To be clear, I wasn't advocating for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8188)|
| 2:16:30| I was just asking what the long-term plan was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8190)|
| 2:16:33| So I just wanted to add how it's minimal to this immediate plan, and I think it's a good first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8193)|
| 2:16:44| Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8204)|
| 2:16:49| I guess to your point, Commissioner Schelso, I mean, if we're doing research during the meeting, it just…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8209)|
| 2:16:57| Research in Nashville, not Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| If we're researching points of interest important enough to bring to commission's attention during the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8219)|
| 2:17:06| I believe it goes to my point that we send developers and neighborhoods away for 30 days to go have conversations or 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8226)|
| 2:17:16| We send them away all the time and say, I know you've got bills to pay, and I know you've got people on the clock, and I know you've got concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8236)|
| 2:17:24| but we send them away and say, go discuss it a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8244)|
| 2:17:29| This, I think, is much even bigger and more important, not dismissing that the issue exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8249)|
| 2:17:36| but it's not just 52 vacant lots either, which I believe on one hand argues my point in that it's just a small, tiny drop in the bucket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8256)|
| 2:17:44| It's not going to solve our middle housing problem and why, yes, it's a good step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| It's those unintended consequences I get worried about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8268)|
| 2:17:51| Or on one hand, it's too narrow, and then on the other hand, it's too broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8271)|
| 2:17:55| It still impacts the existing homes, all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8275)|
| 2:18:00| They could all be retrofitted, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8280)|
| 2:18:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| So here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8285)|
| 2:18:06| We just had a great conversation about 121 Union Avenue and Zero State Street, and we had a very close vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8286)|
| 2:18:14| And the quotes I took down, because I was anticipating this conversation, were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8294)|
| 2:18:19| spot zoning in the oldest neighborhood in our city for such a small percentage should not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8299)|
| 2:18:31| What would be our oldest city in our oldest districts, our oldest areas in our neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8311)|
| 2:18:40| Such a small space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8320)|
| 2:18:43| So we're talking about very small on one hand, and yet also very large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8323)|
| 2:18:48| But spot zoning in the oldest neighborhood in our city for such a small percentage, it just rings so true to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8328)|
| 2:18:55| And if anything, I just feel like, if nothing else, that moves us forward to creating more opportunity for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8335)|
| 2:19:04| and bringing all these great minds together to give this another more thorough look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8344)|
| 2:19:11| It is 51 vacant R and 1 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8351)|
| 2:19:14| I said 52, so maybe it's 51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8354)|
| 2:19:17| All right, I concede to 51 instead of 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8357)|
| 2:19:22| Commissioner Higgins, don't you hate it when they turn your own words against you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8362)|
| 2:19:25| I know, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8365)|
| 2:19:26| It happens to me all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8366)|
| 2:19:30| I would like to clarify that I think that this is the opposite of spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8370)|
| 2:19:34| I think that this is really trying to take a broad problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8374)|
| 2:19:39| I think that it is a baby step, but I don't think it is a spot zone, and I don't think it's out of character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8379)|
| 2:19:47| The phrase spot zoning is usually used to say this is a one small instance that is out of character with the surrounding context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8387)|
| 2:19:58| And I think this is the exact opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8398)|
| 2:20:00| This is what is being proposed here, I think, is very much in character with the traditional neighborhood forms and how those were developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8400)|
| 2:20:10| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8410)|
| 2:20:15| Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8415)|
| 2:20:16| And yet, I'm not sure it does conform with the neighborhood to have multiple units in a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8416)|
| 2:20:25| I don't know all the architectural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8425)|

| 2:20:36| But I'm not sure, even if you make the facade look the same, that having multiple units in a lot in between multiples, I don't think that is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8436)|
| 2:20:47| I don't think it's the same, and I don't think the neighbors think it's the same when that moves right next door to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8447)|

| 2:25:01| If I could ask, what is the expectation with the postponement, that we will see a revision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8701)|
| 2:25:24| I would envision more development of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8724)|
| 2:25:29| I think there were some concerns from the neighborhood that need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8729)|
| 2:25:34| There were items that were brought forth by some of the commissioners that may be reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8734)|
| 2:25:42| better explained, you know, take a deeper look at the parking, a variety of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8742)|
| 2:25:48| And I just want to make sure that we're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8748)|
| 2:25:49| It's a broader application of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8749)|
| 2:25:51| You know, it's better to, what's the old saying, measure twice, cut once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8751)|
| 2:25:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8756)|
| 2:25:57| And I just want to make sure that we're giving proper direction as to what the, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8757)|
| 2:26:03| what we expect out of staff and out of the city for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8763)|
| 2:26:06| And I think additional engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8766)|
| 2:26:09| And I'm not being one bit critical here, but we're affecting a good number of people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8769)|
| 2:26:17| And I understand why we're rolling it out in a limited way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8777)|
| 2:26:19| I think that's wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8779)|
| 2:26:21| But I think more engagement with the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8781)|
| 2:26:27| That's what we direct the developers to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8787)|
| 2:26:31| Does that mean that that's what we're asking the city to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8791)|
| 2:26:40| I mean, I don't know that I have the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8800)|
| 2:26:43| That would be my desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8803)|
| 2:26:44| You all can share your desires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8804)|
| 2:26:47| I'm asking you because there was a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| You said there was a desire for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8809)|
| 2:26:52| And I think Commissioner Higgins' question is fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8812)|
| 2:26:55| We typically do say when you're postponing, we really think there should be more dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8815)|
| 2:26:59| between the community developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| Like, I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8821)|
| 2:27:02| So providing some guidance...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8822)|
| 2:27:04| We had over a hundred meetings in recode that, what, over almost two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8824)|
| 2:27:10| And I think we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8830)|
| 2:27:11| This...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8831)|
| 2:27:12| I didn't hear anybody say it was just on time or too slow out from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8832)|
| 2:27:17| And I'm just asking that we spend just a little more time, 60 more days, conversing with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8837)|
| 2:27:22| community, understanding what their concerns are, and then bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8842)|
| 2:27:27| And then the community will have a chance to speak to it again in 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8847)|
| 2:27:35| Is that specific enough, or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8855)|
| 2:27:38| I mean, I guess that you're asking the city to hold more public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8858)|
| 2:27:45| I think that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8865)|
| 2:27:48| When I say more community engagement, I think that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8868)|
| 2:27:51| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8871)|
| 2:27:52| I mean, we went into pretty much each community during recode and had meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8872)|
| 2:27:59| That's because it was a code that was going across the entire...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8879)|
| 2:28:02| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8882)|
| 2:28:03| We've gone into each of these communities that are being affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8883)|
| 2:28:07| Maybe we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8887)|
| 2:28:08| I don't think we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8888)|
| 2:28:10| But that might be a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8890)|
| 2:28:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8894)|
| 2:28:21| On to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8901)|
| 2:28:22| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8902)|
| 2:28:28| Question number 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8908)|
| 2:28:40| Staff recommends denial of amendments as opposed to the city zoning code article 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8920)|
| 2:28:44| The CN zone has not been evaluated in relation to the creation of middle housing forms as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8924)|
| 2:28:50| permitting for residential uses in the CN zone occurs within plans review and inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8930)|
| 2:28:58| Planning staff do not evaluate residential development in this zone and further analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8938)|
| 2:29:04| would be needed from both departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8944)|
| 2:29:06| Additionally, setback reductions based on housing forms are incorporated into the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8946)|
| 2:29:12| proposed middle housing standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8952)|
| 2:29:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8955)|
| 2:29:17| This is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8957)|
| 2:29:18| Who should I call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8958)|
| 2:29:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8959)|
| 2:29:20| Ms. Crockett, do you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8960)|
| 2:29:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8966)|
| 2:29:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8968)|
| 2:29:29| We've got signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8969)|
| 2:29:31| Mr. Bentley Marlowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8971)|
| 2:29:33| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8973)|
| 2:29:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8979)|
| 2:29:41| You may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8981)|
| 2:29:42| If you'll give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8982)|
| 2:29:45| Are there anyone else signed up to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8987)|
| 2:29:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8988)|
| 2:29:49| R. Bentley Marlowe, 322 Douglas Avenue, 37921 over Mechanic's Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8989)|
| 2:29:54| So Optica's missing middle standards report, whatever, scan, that's what it was called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=8994)|
| 2:30:02| didn't have a scope to include CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9002)|
| 2:30:05| I think CN is very useful for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9005)|
| 2:30:08| We allow residential in CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9008)|
| 2:30:10| I heard a lot of conversation, not just at this meeting, but at many other meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9010)|
| 2:30:15| even from council, that we should focus housing on corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9015)|
| 2:30:20| And while that's talking about the major corridors, I mean, every one of these neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9020)|
| 2:30:26| has got connectors, and they create little commercial nodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9026)|
| 2:30:30| And in some of these, particularly over Mechanic's Hill, it's just not feasible, kind of like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9030)|
| 2:30:34| the downtown building on State Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9034)|
| 2:30:37| It's not feasible to have commercial there, but it would be great to have townhomes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9037)|
| 2:30:45| Addressing some of these setbacks, if you're using CN exclusively for residential, why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9045)|
| 2:30:51| do we need such a wide buffer yard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9051)|
| 2:30:53| Why do we need these large setbacks if we're doing CN for residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9053)|
| 2:30:59| It just seems like we could make a little tweak there to encourage some of the vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9059)|
| 2:31:04| lots that are CN or could be CN on the corridors to become useful for townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9064)|
| 2:31:11| We're paying 40% tax rate, which is higher than residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9071)|
| 2:31:15| Seems like we ought to be allowed to use a little bit more of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9075)|
| 2:31:17| Seems like a fair trade-off, particularly when we're desperate for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9077)|
| 2:31:21| So that's sort of the spirit of what I'm going after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9081)|
| 2:31:23| Now, I'm not suggesting that if you're building a tire store or a gas station, convenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9083)|
| 2:31:27| store on CN that abuts a neighborhood, that we modify any of the setbacks or buffer yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9087)|
| 2:31:33| Only when you're using CN exclusively for residential purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9093)|
| 2:31:37| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9097)|
| 2:31:46| I tend to actually agree with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9106)|
| 2:31:51| I mean, CN in the city and NC in the county are similar in the sense that they're designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9111)|
| 2:31:59| to be next to residential, but it's still a commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9119)|
| 2:32:03| So we've imposed these heavier setbacks to protect the neighbors from a use that's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9123)|
| 2:32:10| to be a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9130)|
| 2:32:14| So I mean, if it does come through and have a residential use, I think that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9134)|
| 2:32:21| Jumping back just a hair to the last case, too, and we'll dovetail these together, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9141)|
| 2:32:30| we've got a 60-day postponement on the missing middle, and I think that's a good opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9150)|
| 2:32:35| for us not only to reach out to the neighbors, but also to incorporate some of these other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9155)|
| 2:32:41| things that were talked about and maybe expand on the areas and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9161)|
| 2:32:48| As Commissioner Levinson likes to say, if you walk like a duck, talk like a duck, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9168)|
| 2:32:53| a duck, but if you're half chicken, half duck, you're a chicken duck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9173)|
| 2:32:56| So I mean, if we're going to do it, let's do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9176)|
| 2:33:00| So I guess where I'm going with this is, is there even a way to merge in some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9180)|
| 2:33:07| neighborhood commercial in the missing middle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9187)|
| 2:33:09| I mean, just because Opticos didn't look at it, we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9189)|
| 2:33:14| I'm just throwing it out there for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9194)|
| 2:33:17| If I may, my red line version that we pulled up on the screen before does incorporate some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9197)|
| 2:33:23| of this into the missing middle framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9203)|
| 2:33:27| Director Brooks, would you like to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9207)|
| 2:33:30| I just want to clarify that staff did evaluate this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9210)|
| 2:33:32| We didn't just say, you know, revert back to what the missing middle housing scan did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9212)|
| 2:33:37| We did take the time to evaluate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9217)|
| 2:33:50| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9230)|
| 2:33:51| I agree that this does need more attention, because to the applicant's point, if we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9231)|
| 2:34:02| dealing with all residential next to all residential, I think that there needs to be some considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9242)|
| 2:34:10| for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9250)|
| 2:34:11| So I think that these are some very good possible amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9251)|
| 2:34:17| I don't know what it would look like to support them, or if maybe staff could continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9257)|
| 2:34:28| keep this in the work program and look at it in a little bit more depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9268)|
| 2:34:33| But I think these are really, really good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9273)|
| 2:34:40| Director Brooks, would you like to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9280)|
| 2:34:41| How do we move this along?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9281)|
| 2:34:45| I mean, I know one way of doing it, but to make sure that your staff has staffed it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9285)|
| 2:34:54| In terms of adding it to, so you all would like for us to, instead of denying this, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9294)|
| 2:35:02| want to put this on our work program to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9302)|
| 2:35:07| Is that what you're requesting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9307)|
| 2:35:08| I think that seems to be the desire, to say, hey, if we're doing residential to residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9308)|
| 2:35:14| why not make some provision for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9314)|
| 2:35:17| It is within your purview to ask us to take another look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9317)|
| 2:35:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9320)|
| 2:35:21| Do we need to do that by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9321)|
| 2:35:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9322)|
| 2:35:23| Well, you need to act on this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9323)|
| 2:35:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9326)|
| 2:35:27| Vice Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9327)|
| 2:35:28| I think what I would like to do, just because he paid a fee, which is a pretty big dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9328)|
| 2:35:36| amount here, and took the time to enlighten us on some things that we all think might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9336)|
| 2:35:41| be considered to be a part of this, I would recommend that we postpone this for 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9341)|
| 2:35:46| to allow him to tag along to what we're doing and get some use out of his fee here and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9346)|
| 2:35:53| him be able to incorporate some comments or feedback and forth as it relates to this specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9353)|
| 2:35:58| ordinance amendment that he's got before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9358)|
| 2:36:01| So I would recommend that we postpone it 60 days and ask staff to review it alongside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9361)|
| 2:36:06| with the other previous agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9366)|
| 2:36:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9371)|
| 2:36:12| If that was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9372)|
| 2:36:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9373)|
| 2:36:14| We've got a motion to postpone for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9374)|
| 2:36:17| We had a whole series of seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9377)|
| 2:36:21| Commissioner Huber, I'll give you the second credit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9381)|
| 2:36:24| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9384)|
| 2:36:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9386)|
| 2:36:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9387)|
| 2:36:28| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9388)|
| 2:36:29| I'll try to get through these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9389)|
| 2:36:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9391)|
| 2:36:32| 24?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9392)|
| 2:36:33| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9393)|
| 2:36:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9394)|
| 2:36:35| Item 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9395)|
| 2:36:36| Staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9396)|
| 2:36:38| Recommend approval amendments to section 10.3.B.3, removing requirement that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9398)|
| 2:36:45| official certify the utilities are adequate for an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9405)|
| 2:36:50| Part of 10.B.7, removing interior side and rear setbacks specific to ADUs, 10.B.8, removing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9410)|
| 2:37:02| maximum gross floor area requirements based on lot area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9422)|
| 2:37:06| Recommend denial of amendments to sections 10.3.A.4, removing the 18-foot height requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9426)|
| 2:37:15| for accessory structures, 10.3.B.2, removing the owner-occupied requirement in TDR land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9435)|
| 2:37:23| use areas, 10.3.B.4, removing the minimum lot area requirement for an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9443)|
| 2:37:29| Part of 10.B.7, allowing ADUs in front and corner side yards, 10.3.B.9, adding a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9449)|
| 2:37:38| standard based on primary dwellings smaller than 1,250 square feet, and 10.3.B.11, removing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9458)|
| 2:37:46| the parking space requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9466)|
| 2:37:50| And the applicant is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9470)|
| 2:37:52| Bentley Marlow, 322 Douglas Avenue, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9472)|
| 2:37:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9476)|
| 2:37:59| So this one probably is most appropriately postponed for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9479)|
| 2:38:04| My red line version of the mayor's proposal incorporates carriage houses, which is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9484)|
| 2:38:08| Optico's preferred language for an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9488)|
| 2:38:12| And I borrowed from that proposal into this revision, the TDR area, to certain members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9492)|
| 2:38:19| of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9499)|
| 2:38:20| And I borrowed the story measurement height to work, to make a more workable framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9500)|
| 2:38:27| for height while being respectful of planning staff's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9507)|
| 2:38:32| And I incorporated a lot of revisions that Peter Ahrens in Plans Review wanted for enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9512)|
| 2:38:37| status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9517)|
| 2:38:38| So it's really kind of a missing middle agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9518)|
| 2:38:41| So it's probably most appropriate to postpone for 60 days to be seen in the totality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9521)|
| 2:38:46| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9526)|
| 2:38:47| I move we postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9527)|
| 2:38:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9530)|
| 2:38:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9531)|
| 2:38:53| Commissioner Levinson offered a 60-day postponement motion and seconded by Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9533)|
| 2:39:01| We have one light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9541)|
| 2:39:02| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9542)|
| 2:39:03| Two lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9543)|
| 2:39:04| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9544)|
| 2:39:05| Go ahead, Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9545)|
| 2:39:09| So are we suggesting, I mean, as part of that, seeing if we want to add ADUs to the missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9549)|
| 2:39:18| middle housing plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9558)|
| 2:39:21| I see they're separate parts of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9561)|
| 2:39:23| And so, I mean, I kind of see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9563)|
| 2:39:25| I see them more separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9565)|
| 2:39:27| I also see them fitting based on the plan that we just looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9567)|
| 2:39:33| I see them potentially fitting on a broader scale than just the TDR area or even if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9573)|
| 2:39:40| were to be expanded on just, you know, the center city area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9580)|
| 2:39:44| So I don't see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9584)|
| 2:39:46| I can see them moving in tandem as a housing strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9586)|
| 2:39:48| I don't see them needing to move in tandem with the missing middle housing proposal that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9588)|
| 2:39:54| we just reviewed, particularly when it comes to, you know, if we were to look at the removing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9594)|
| 2:40:01| the owner occupancy requirement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9601)|
| 2:40:03| So other cities use ADUs as a middle housing strategy to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9603)|
| 2:40:13| It's not something that OPTICO's looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9613)|
| 2:40:15| So no, we haven't really incorporated that into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9615)|
| 2:40:19| But there are some very robust plans that other cities have for ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9619)|
| 2:40:25| They have pre-approved plan books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| And I think it's something that we should move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9628)|
| 2:40:33| But I don't see them as much as being tied together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9633)|
| 2:40:37| So I'm going to vote against postponing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9637)|
| 2:40:41| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9641)|
| 2:40:43| I'm not necessarily against postponement, but I do want to make a comment and ask a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9643)|
| 2:40:50| question about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9650)|
| 2:40:52| I really think there's a lot of value in the part of this proposal to remove the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9652)|
| 2:40:59| occupied requirement within this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9659)|
| 2:41:03| And I think that there's been, I've heard a lot of support of that idea of taking away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9663)|
| 2:41:08| the owner occupancy requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9668)|
| 2:41:11| And with that, I would like to ask a question maybe to plans review and inspections if someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9671)|
| 2:41:18| here could speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9678)|
| 2:41:19| But I'm interested in how that is even, a requirement like that is even enforceable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9679)|
| 2:41:27| long term if you build an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9687)|
| 2:41:31| Maybe at the, there's two aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9691)|
| 2:41:35| If you've got a vacant lot and you build a house with an ADU, how do you prove that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9695)|
| 2:41:38| your primary residence if there's no house there for you to set that as your address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9698)|
| 2:41:45| And then secondly, if you do have a build an ADU on your property and you move away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9705)|
| 2:41:50| and rent out both and what's to prevent that long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9710)|
| 2:41:57| If you wouldn't care to comment on that, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9717)|
| 2:42:05| Director Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9725)|
| 2:42:07| Good afternoon, Peter Ahrens, Plans Review and Building Inspections Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9727)|
| 2:42:13| We focus our attention on the creation of the ADU is when we validate owner occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9733)|
| 2:42:22| And for that first question, you know, if someone is building an ADU with, in tandem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9742)|
| 2:42:29| with a new house, how do they show their owner occupancy in that new construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9749)|
| 2:42:37| Our staff will ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9757)|
| 2:42:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9759)|
| 2:42:40| Simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9760)|
| 2:42:41| And with that, to my point, we can't control this long term that it's owner occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9761)|
| 2:42:51| So I think, if anything, having this requirement up front is just a hindrance to potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9771)|
| 2:42:58| more housing options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9778)|
| 2:43:01| Think about even someone could be renting a house and want their parents or a family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9781)|
| 2:43:07| member, a friend, to be their neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9787)|
| 2:43:11| And an ADU would be a perfect scenario for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9791)|
| 2:43:15| If you've got kids and you've got family members that could live there, there's a phrase called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9795)|
| 2:43:22| a mother-in-law suite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9802)|
| 2:43:24| That applies to people who don't own the houses too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9804)|
| 2:43:26| So I really think that there's a lot of merit to removing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9806)|
| 2:43:30| And I would be in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9810)|
| 2:43:32| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9812)|
| 2:43:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9813)|
| 2:43:34| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9814)|
| 2:43:35| Just kind of in response to that narrative, I can't speak to how enforcement could practically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9815)|
| 2:43:41| work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9821)|
| 2:43:42| I do know in other cities there is enforcement, namely Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9822)|
| 2:43:44| I used to live there and know that you're not allowed to have an ADU that's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9824)|
| 2:43:50| renter occupied and also have the primary residency renter occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9830)|
| 2:43:53| So kind of in the spirit of, you know, looking at other peer cities, I think that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9833)|
| 2:43:58| interesting to consider how they enforce that and what success or challenges they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9838)|
| 2:44:02| had with that, maybe before we kind of agree to do away with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9842)|
| 2:44:06| So that would be, I guess, my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9846)|
| 2:44:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9850)|
| 2:44:13| So we've got before us a motion to postpone 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9853)|
| 2:44:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9857)|
| 2:44:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9859)|
| 2:44:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9860)|
| 2:44:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9861)|
| 2:44:22| We've got one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9862)|

| 2:44:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9887)|
| 2:44:49| The applicant is Mr. Bentley Marlowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9889)|
| 2:44:54| Bentley Marlowe, 322 Douglas Avenue, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9894)|
| 2:44:59| Well, this is pretty self-explanatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9899)|
| 2:45:03| I think if you talk to many architects, particularly Opticos, the Real Estate Association, many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9903)|
| 2:45:12| of us builders, land planners all over, we dedicate a ridiculous amount of space to parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9912)|
| 2:45:20| And unless we want to start having issues like the West Coast where they have the van| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9920)|
| 2:45:27| lord phenomenon where they're using vacant parking spaces to park RVs as housing units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9927)|
| 2:45:33| we might want to address this issue to reduce our parking minimums, perhaps turning it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9933)|
| 2:45:40| its head to make parking maximums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9940)|
| 2:45:43| I really believe that the market will sort this out most efficiently and effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9943)|
| 2:45:47| I'm not going to build a residential unit that I can't rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9947)|
| 2:45:52| And so I'm taking into consideration what my tenants are driving, how large their cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9952)|
| 2:45:57| are, how small their cars are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9957)|
| 2:45:58| Some tenants are just going to e-bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9958)|
| 2:46:00| I've got several now that are taking the approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9960)|
| 2:46:03| I think if Dustin's still here, I think his name was Dustin with the CAT, the Car Light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9963)|
| 2:46:08| Lifestyle, I think he called it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9968)|
| 2:46:10| I'm seeing that with some of my tenants across my 32 rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9970)|
| 2:46:14| So I think it's time that we take a serious look at our parking requirements, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9974)|
| 2:46:19| when we think about how much space that they require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9979)|
| 2:46:22| And when we're dealing with small lots of record and trying to build housing on these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9982)|
| 2:46:27| older lots in the TDR areas of the city, often the space required for a parking minimum requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9987)|
| 2:46:33| a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9993)|
| 2:46:34| In fact, I have a six-pack of variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9994)|
| 2:46:37| I almost always have to ask for parking variance, front setback, side setback, rear setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=9997)|
| 2:46:44| building coverage, and impervious coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10004)|
| 2:46:46| One move forward would be addressing this parking stuff, and it keeps coming up over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10006)|
| 2:46:53| and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10013)|
| 2:46:55| The missing middle plan we just heard, sometimes some of the larger, broader plans talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10015)|
| 2:47:01| we might need to reduce our parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10021)|
| 2:47:03| I think it's something we ought to be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10023)|
| 2:47:05| And this is just sort of a shotgun approach to start the discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10025)|
| 2:47:09| If you guys believe it needs more study, I'll certainly respect your judgment and wisdom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10029)|
| 2:47:14| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10034)|
| 2:47:15| If you guys think that you're ready to send this to council, I'm also willing to play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10035)|
| 2:47:20| ball and respect that judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10040)|
| 2:47:21| So it's in your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10041)|
| 2:47:23| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10043)|
| 2:47:25| Commissioner Schell, we just had a discussion about the missing middle proposal and parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10045)|
| 2:47:42| We previously had discussed it with ADUs, and I think it's hard to go get rid of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10062)|
| 2:47:48| all at once in all of these different districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10068)|
| 2:47:51| Each one really needs to be looked at separately, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10071)|
| 2:47:57| But I don't deny that this is an important thing that we should look at, going back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10077)|
| 2:48:02| missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10082)|
| 2:48:04| So let's just say we passed this, but then we had passed missing middle today, so would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10084)|
| 2:48:10| that require parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10090)|
| 2:48:12| How would those two conflict, or would those two conflict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10092)|
| 2:48:17| So I don't think this makes sense right now, but I think it's warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10097)|
| 2:48:24| Another thing to maybe add to the work program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10104)|
| 2:48:28| So I'm going to make a motion to deny per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10108)|
| 2:48:34| We've got a motion to deny by Commissioner Schell, seconded by Commissioner Adams, seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10114)|
| 2:48:39| no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10119)|

| 2:48:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10121)|
| 2:48:42| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10122)|
| 2:48:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10123)|

| 2:48:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10133)|
| 2:48:54| Let's go to agenda item 27, applicant Blackmon Construction, location southeast side of East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10134)|
| 2:49:00| Emory, northeast side of Thomas Lane, 2.27 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10140)|
| 2:49:05| Present plan designation zoning is low density residential, planned residential, up to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10145)|
| 2:49:11| dwelling units per acre, agricultural, planned residential, up to five dwelling units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10151)|

| 2:49:29| Density proposed up to six dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10169)|
| 2:49:33| This will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10173)|
| 2:49:35| First recommendation, deny the sector plan amendment to medium density residential because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10175)|
| 2:49:41| it does not meet the location criteria for MDR and is not consistent with development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10181)|
| 2:49:46| in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10186)|
| 2:49:48| Second motion, staff recommendation, approve the request to rezone the A zone portion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10188)|
| 2:49:53| the parcel to PR up to five dwelling units per acre to make it consistent with the rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10193)|
| 2:49:59| of the parcel because it is consistent with the sector plan and the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10199)|
| 2:50:04| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10204)|
| 2:50:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10205)|
| 2:50:06| Robert Campbell, 7523 Taggart Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10206)|
| 2:50:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10209)|
| 2:50:10| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10210)|
| 2:50:13| Seeing no opposition, you may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10213)|
| 2:50:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10215)|
| 2:50:17| And first of all, before I get started, Mafioso's on 12th Avenue is a tremendous place to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10217)|
| 2:50:22| a pizza at, so just want to, you made me hungry a minute ago, but this is a situation where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10222)|
| 2:50:29| the larger parcel was zoned at five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10229)|
| 2:50:33| We've got already nine townhomes are approved, and so that was, the owner then bought this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10233)|
| 2:50:43| smaller parcel, and again, going to five units an acre seemed to be all right, but what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10243)|
| 2:50:49| did is it put us in between a unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10249)|
| 2:50:52| We have three triplexes already on the plan, and we want to do another triplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10252)|
| 2:50:58| So that brings us to 11.4, and while I certainly very much appreciate what staff is trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10258)|
| 2:51:06| to do with MDR, just as you have the opportunity to tell me, no way, this is stupid, you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10266)|
| 2:51:14| the next person that comes in that wants to do MDR, no way, this is stupid as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10274)|
| 2:51:19| I believe my case has got some merit because this corridor is changing rapidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10279)|
| 2:51:26| It is on Emory Road between Halls and Gibbs, Halls and Gibbs are growing astronomically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10286)|
| 2:51:31| There's actually a T-dot widening plan from Halls to Gibbs to either make Emory Road a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10291)|
| 2:51:37| three-lane or a five-lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10297)|
| 2:51:38| Now, I'm not going to sit here and tell you it's going to happen tomorrow, but it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10298)|
| 2:51:41| been put out to design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10301)|
| 2:51:42| So this corridor, at some point in time, will be an MDR corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10302)|
| 2:51:48| There are other parcels along this corridor that are zoned a little bit differently, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10308)|
| 2:51:54| all I'm trying to do is try to get that .6 of a unit so I can have the consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10314)|
| 2:52:01| of the development instead of having this one unit sitting off by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10321)|
| 2:52:07| That's why I'm there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10327)|
| 2:52:08| I appreciate what staff is trying to do and normally don't try to buck what they're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10328)|
| 2:52:14| but in this case, it certainly makes, it just makes sense to me to be able to have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10334)|
| 2:52:22| consistency on the development, so I'll shut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10342)|
| 2:52:27| Commissioner, Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10347)|
| 2:52:33| I think, I respect Mr. Campbell a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10353)|
| 2:52:37| I've seen him quite a bit in the past and if this piece of property was closer to Gibbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10357)|
| 2:52:42| at Harperson Crossroads or back towards Maynardville Highway, I would be the first one to shake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10362)|
| 2:52:48| your hand and say, yeah, you've got a great argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10368)|
| 2:52:50| This particular case, it's not MDR right in the middle of all that stretch of East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10370)|
| 2:52:56| Emory today, I think is just a little premature, and I think that a 5D per the acre townhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10376)|
| 2:53:03| development is right in the sweet spot with everything else around it, and I think staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10383)|
| 2:53:08| got this one right, so I'd love to tell you, yes, great argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10388)|
| 2:53:14| I like your peachy joint too, but I'm going to make a motion that we deny the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-231005?start=10394)|
