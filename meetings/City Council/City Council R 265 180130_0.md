| 0:02:07| Is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=127)|

| 0:02:40| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=160)|
| 0:02:42| Any opposed? Those are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| For the mayor's report, first I want to announce two important government meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| that are coming up next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| First, on Monday, February 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| community development staff will hold their annual meeting to discuss the 2018-19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=173)|
| 0:03:00| annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| This plan sets the priorities for how the city will propose to spend the funds we receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| specifically the Community Development Block Grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| the Home Investment Partnership Act funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| and the Emergency Solutions Grant Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| At Monday's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| members of the city's Community Development Department will be listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| and gathering input on community needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| So residents, social service providers, housing providers, other stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| you're all invited to attend, ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| and provide feedback for the annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| And the goal of the annual plan is to respond to current community needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| as well as those that are reflected in the five-year consolidated plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| and the current one is 2015-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| These are all requirements by HUD to receive those federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| And here's an example of how needs and priorities can change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| even over just a few years, and why giving your input is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| So when the last five-year plan was created in 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| or since then, the amount of available affordable rental housing began to decrease in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| So the annual plans these past two years have been adjusted to meet this pressing need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| We've prioritized programs to increase the number of affordable rental units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| including adding to the available federal dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| by starting a city-funded $2 million affordable rental housing development fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| So this is just an example of some of the new needs that come out of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| in addition to what had been predicted in the five-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| So we need your help in recognizing what the pressing issues are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| and how our priorities should be set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| So that public meeting on the 2018-19 annual action plan will be held at 5.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=293)|
| 0:05:00| on Monday, February 5, 2018, at the John T. O'Connor Senior Citizen Center, 611 Winona Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=300)|
| 0:05:10| If you can't attend Monday's meeting and would like to provide comments or ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| please contact Linda Rust in the city's Community Development Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| You can email her at lrust at KnoxvilleTN.gov or call 865-215-2357.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=320)|
| 0:05:29| If you didn't catch that, you can always call 311, and they will give you that contact information as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=329)|
| 0:05:35| So the second important government meeting next week is the city's annual budget retreat with City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=335)|
| 0:05:42| That retreat starts at 9 a.m. on Friday, February 9, at the Public Work Service Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=342)|
| 0:05:48| which is 3131 Morris Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| My staff and I will present updates to City Council, including a mid-year budget review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| just to kind of show where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| You know, we start the year with the budget, projecting what we think our revenues will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=359)|
| 0:06:05| and what projects we anticipate spending money on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| And so we always get together mid-year to get an update on where we are with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=369)|
| 0:06:15| And also we'll give status reports on major city initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| The retreat, of course, is open to the public, but if you're unable to be there in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| CTV will be broadcasting the proceedings, and the city's finance and communications departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=383)|
| 0:06:30| will post documents on the city's website afterward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| That website is www.knoxvilleTN.gov slash budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=394)|
| 0:06:41| Finally, please help us spread the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| Ontario Medical will be running a five-day free medical clinic at the Jacob Building in Chilhowee Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=404)|
| 0:06:50| starting at 6 a.m. tomorrow, which is Wednesday, January 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=410)|
| 0:06:57| And medical, dental, and vision services will be provided through Sunday, February 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=417)|
| 0:07:05| So it's from Wednesday morning at 6 a.m. through Sunday, February 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| This is RAM's 900th clinic worldwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| It's pretty impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| And they expect to treat some 2,500 people over five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| The good work done by remote area medical staff and volunteers is recognized and acclaimed internationally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| and we are happy to host them at our city facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| RAM literally works wonders and provides help to those who are most vulnerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| We are aware that services are offered on a first-come, first-service basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| RAM gives patients numbered admission tickets as they enter the designated parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| The lot opens at midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| That would be midnight tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| And ticket distribution begins at 3 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| So I've seen this happen before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| The lines come early, and people line up because of the excellent care that they know they will be getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=481)|
| 0:08:08| Patients must be present to receive a ticket, and they will be admitted in numerical order by ticket number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| And a ticket is required for admission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| So to get more information, look at their website, which is RAMusa.org, O-R-G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=497)|
| 0:08:26| for complete details on available services and exactly how to receive help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| One last thing I would like to mention is I want to thank our police officers, our firefighters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| Knoxville area transit drivers, and especially our public service department crews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| for their hard work during the mid-January snow event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| Actually, we were all right here at city council when the snow was falling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| and cancellations and closures were being announced due to uncertainty about road conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| I'm happy to report that here in the city, our public service pretreatment and clearing of roads are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=537)|
| 0:09:04| we have different tiered roads based on usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| But implementing that snow plan kept us safe and mobile, at least on the main roads, as dictated by our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=549)|
| 0:09:17| And CAT kept its buses continually rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| It takes a really big effort to handle even a small amount of snow when the weather is so cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| We've shared these numbers through social media, but they're worth repeating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| Over three days, the city applied 28,000 gallons of brine pretreatment and spread 1,000 tons of salt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=572)|
| 0:09:40| Public service deployed 88 employees and logged about 2,000 hours of labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=580)|
| 0:09:46| Our 22 salt trucks and six brine trucks treated 1,800 lane miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=586)|
| 0:09:53| So our estimates for the cost of that, the material, the equipment, and the labor costs, are just under 131,191.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=593)|
| 0:10:04| So thanks to Chad Weth, Rachel Butzler, and their team in public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| And I personally hope we're getting close to the end of winter and on to spring, but we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| We've got more weather approaching here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| But we do want to thank public service and our public safety, all of our officials, for helping us get through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=617)|
| 0:10:24| That is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| Are there reports from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| I just want to welcome the Knoxville Interdenominational Christian Ministerial Alliance, better known as KICMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| I want to thank you for being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| If you'll raise your hand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=646)|

| 0:17:44| They can have up to three speakers for up to five minutes each, and I set the timer and manage the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1064)|
| 0:17:51| After they're finished, then the respondents, we have three who have signed up to speak as respondents to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1071)|
| 0:17:59| and then after they also have up to three people, up to five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| then the appellants then get one person can speak for up to two minutes for a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| And then, of course, you all can ask any questions and call in any of the speakers to respond to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1089)|
| 0:18:17| So with that, we'll start with any questions about that, Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| So we will start with the appellants, and I've got in this order Michelle Ivester, Deborah Thomas, and then Deborah Brenneman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1101)|
| 0:18:32| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| He does have to read it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Thank you, Will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| N.A. is a resolution approving an appeal by Oakwood-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association of MPC's decision to deny their appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| of the Infill Housing Design Review Committee's decision to grant a certificate of appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| to Knoxville Habitat for Humanity Incorporated to construct a new home at 431 East Springdale Avenue, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1130)|
| 0:18:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| So may I please state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| We'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| I'll let you know when you're about a minute out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| My name is Michelle Ivester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| I live at 1131 Chickamauga Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| I'm the Oakwood-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association Vice President as well as the Neighborhood Watch Coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| We appreciate your consideration on this somewhat complicated issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| We apologize for not getting our packet submitted earlier as we weren't aware that there was a time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| to have it included on the website for public viewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| However, Mr. Johnson has been kind enough to confirm that everyone has received the 12-page packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1169)|
| 0:19:35| This is actually the third time that we've come before City Council for this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| We want to thank previous City Council members for standing behind our neighborhood thus far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| and we hope that we can garner your support yet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| The Infill Design Review Committee has granted a certificate of appropriateness to this developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| for the property on three separate occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| Those certificates have been nullified twice, the original certificate for roof pitch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| and the second for design of mismatched styles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| We now ask you to deny this certificate because the design most recently approved by the Infill Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| like the prior ones, has yet to conform to the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| The fact that the previous two certificates were nullified should speak volumes to this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| There are merits to our appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| To quote the City's website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| the purpose of the infill guidelines is to reestablish the architectural character of those historically valuable properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| with new housing that is architecturally compatible to foster neighborhood stability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| ensuring that new construction is consistent with the original houses on any given block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| Unfortunately, the current proposed house design most closely resembles the squat brick house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| on the corner of East Springdale and Harvey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| That house, the developer has repeatedly been told not to use as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| That house was built in the 70s after the original Victorian burned down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| but before the guidelines were put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| The developer insists on using their incompatible plan, claiming it's craftsman style,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| despite the majority of the surrounding original houses being Victorians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| You can't put a front porch on a rancher and call it a craftsman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| If they want to build ranchers, they can do that where ranchers are predominant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| Some sections of Oakwood Lincoln Park have post-war cottages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| so they needed a design for that too because a rancher would not fit there either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| As per our packet, the proposed design lacks in both overall width and in exterior wall height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| and is inconsistent with Section 4 of the infill guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| which speaks to how the scale of early homes were generally consistent from one house to another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| to protect the overall architectural harmony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| The surrounding original homes vary in width, mainly between 32 feet up to 40 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1296)|
| 0:21:43| whereas the proposed design is only 28 feet wide, even more narrow than the brick house on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1303)|
| 0:21:50| The wall heights of the original houses range from 9.5 feet to 11 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| and we were dismayed to find the current proposal has a wall height of less than 9 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| after being discussed at a long-awaited meeting with the developer and MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| Having two houses side-by-side that are smaller in both mass and scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| alters the streetscape and redefines the character of the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| The confusion surrounding the meeting between Habitat and the neighbors was addressed in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| I would like to reiterate that neighbors agreed under duress to the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| conditioned upon Habitat going back before the infill design committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| so we were surprised to have the resolution brought about the following day at council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| that would allow them to build immediately circumventing public notice laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| MPC approval, and neighborhoods' opportunity to consider the plans in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| The resolution failed, and the appeal was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| It's important to understand that the design, which is the basis of this appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| was not the design that was presented to us at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| How can developers be compelled to keep the infill guidelines upheld?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| Throughout this ordeal, Habitat has been disingenuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| They've made claims that the demolished house was unsalvageable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| It included damage from fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| However, in speaking to the city fire marshal, we could find no such record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| You have one minute, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| The pictures of the demolition taken by neighbors contradict that claim as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| Outside help was offered for fundraising assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| should compliance with infill guidelines result in additional costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| We're not sure if that was accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| Nevertheless, they returned to infill design with similar poor-fitting plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| and expect to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| Tonight, we are asking that you uphold Oltena's appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| once again denying the certificate of appropriateness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| and help uphold the design guidelines meant to protect and preserve our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| We're not saying don't build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| We're saying build better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| And now Deborah Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| Ms. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1426)|
| 0:23:53| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| My name is Deborah Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| I have lived at 428 East Burwell Avenue for over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| I have served as treasurer, vice president,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| and now president of Oakwood-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| Members attend many meetings citywide to stay on top of current issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| one of them being affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| and we had four board members today attend the NAACP meeting regarding that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| I too would like to apologize for the tardiness of our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| Several of our board members worked on it, and we're not attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| and we have an addiction to editing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| There was actually way too much information in the packet for new council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| so we had to trim it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| There's a great deal of support for these efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| not just from our neighborhood but from sister neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| We have not sought press coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| and have tried to be discreet in our outreach on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| because we support the mission of affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| and do not want negative publicity for this developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| Although the weather and holidays have hampered an extensive door-to-door effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| we have over 80 signatures on our petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| We have hundreds of hours of volunteer effort devoted to working on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| which would be better utilized elsewhere, such as our walking trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| We've had many volunteers working on research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| as well as help from nearby neighbors that share the same concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| Over 20 people donated money to the organization for the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| including former neighborhood leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| We also have the support of Larry Cox, our longtime city councilman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| who supports preservation as well as Habitat's mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| You may have seen these signatures on our petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| In an effort to protect the historic character of the C.B. Atkins section of Oakwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| the association received a resolution to study neighborhood conservation overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| in the fall of 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| This impacts the oldest section of the neighborhood and includes this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| Due to a lack of staffing and money at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| the implementation of that study has not yet begun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| The overlay would ensure greater design consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| and make demolition more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| The NC overlay would not burden existing residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| with strict requirements of historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| Knoxville is experiencing rapid growth and revitalization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| but some investors are tearing down old houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| to build houses that simply don't fit in the original neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| This developer has built at least six houses on sites where Victorians once stood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| and they demolished the Queen Anne Victorian on this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| even after a neighbor offered to buy the property from them to restore the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| The infill design guidelines were developed to protect neighborhoods like Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| and were expanded to protect Edgewood and Oakwood-Lincoln Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| areas that are not under historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| Edgewood does not have houses aging out at the rate that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| but Lonsdale does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| and there are other areas in East Knoxville that don't even have these protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| We have many examples of bad infill in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| some of which were built quite recently despite the infill guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| We included photographs in our packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| and some of the disappointing houses are from this developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| After our initial appeal regarding this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| Habitat built a house on an empty lot on Branner Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| next to a Victorian with a complex roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| Their plan was approved with conditions, including a request for a 6-over-12 roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| The resulting house has a porch with no elevation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| unlike the original houses nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| The overall effect of the house is reduced mass and scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| In many cases, these designs can detract from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| instead of improving the blocks on which they are located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| and that ends up hurting not only the residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| but also the present and future neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| The need for compatible housing design impacts an entire community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| not just one family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| Harmonious design will give the family a sense of belonging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| Look at our packet on page 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| If a private developer can build houses for $110,000 on Atlantic Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| that have appropriate elevation and window placement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| then this developer should be able to do that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| That house needed just a little bit more detail on the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| Especially since much of their labor is supplied by volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| we feel like this developer should be able to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| You have one minute, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| Despite efforts to meet with UT Architecture School and private architects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| we are not seeing an improvement in the standards of their plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| They need designs for a 3-bedroom house that are 30 to 32 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| full Victorian, true craftsman designs for some of the historic blocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| If they want to build where there are shotgun shacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| they might actually need a more narrow house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| We've suggested this need for better plans in 2016 with our original appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| This issue impacts not just the potential residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| but the block and many sister neighborhoods in the heart of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| Supporting the neighborhood encourages adherence to the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| and discourages further inappropriate housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| Thank you for listening, and thanks to those of you that took the time to tour our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| I'd be happy to take you on a guided walking or driving tour at your convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| Please uphold our appeal and deny the certificate of appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| Now Deborah Brenneman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| Thank you for being here, and please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| I'm Deborah Brenneman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| I've lived at 423 East Springdale for over nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| I'm not on the board of the Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| I'm just a concerned neighbor, and there's a few others here as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| neighbors, friends of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| Could you guys all raise your hands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| I live in a folk Victorian that was built more than 100 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| and only one house separates it from the site of the proposed new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| I moved to Oakwood and to my block in particular largely because of its visual appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| Most of the houses are Victorian or craftsman style,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| flanked by grand magnolia trees and tall oaks with sidewalks on both sides of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| It was a walkable, welcoming place, accessible by public transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| close to downtown where I work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| Our old houses are simpler and smaller and more affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| than those in the neighboring areas, Old North Knoxville, 4th and Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| Our neighborhood's residents are far more diverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| They're diverse in many ways, age, race, education, income, even English fluency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1812)|
| 0:30:20| I value the different worldviews that I've gotten to experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| by living near people who are not exactly like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| Turns out that far more unites us than divides us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| My neighborhood is filled with modest houses and hardworking people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| That's why I'm especially disappointed that Habitat has been so dismissive of our concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| about the necessity for appropriate infill design and the ways that their plans fall short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| We completely support Habitat's mission of providing affordable housing for low-income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| Many of us are or once were poor, so affordable housing is an issue that's very close to our hearts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1851)|
| 0:30:58| I know that several current and former board members of the Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| have participated in Habitat builds, and many neighborhood residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| regularly donate to Habitat's Restore, to Goodwill, to Salvation Army, to CARM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| to AMVETS, to Animal Shelters, to other charitable organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| That's because good neighbors look out for each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| I've seen my neighbors mow each other's overgrown lawns when someone was unable to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| whether because of illness or disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| I've seen them help to preserve deteriorating buildings instead of calling codes enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| Just a few weeks ago, one of my water pipes burst due to the extreme cold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| and neighbors came right over to help me shut off the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| Another one offered me a sump pump to stop the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| The Oakwood-Lincoln Park neighborhood is really special, and I'm proud to call it home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| Most people never see all that in Oakwood-Lincoln Park or the other heart of Knoxville neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| They only notice our homes, the houses themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| And that's what the infill guidelines address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| When the guidelines are enforced, new infill construction reflects the character and charm of the original houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| and it preserves the architectural harmony of the entire block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| But if the guidelines are not upheld, it's as if they don't exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| which leads to poor infill designs, like the squat brick house at the end of my block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| Over time, poor infill lowers property values and the city's tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| And one bad infill house on my block is enough, more than enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| Please don't compound the problem by allowing Habitat to build another house next to it with nearly identical dimensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1947)|
| 0:32:36| All new construction in the heart of Knoxville neighborhoods should be forced to conform to the infill guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| regardless of the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| And because the guidelines emphasize the original houses on the block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| Habitat should build a Victorian or possibly a craftsman-style house at 431 East Springdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1966)|
| 0:32:52| They'd need a different design plan for a block where a different house style is predominant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| Their usual ranch-style design is only appropriate where the original houses are ranchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1976)|
| 0:33:04| Twice, the infill committee's grant of a Certificate of Appropriateness for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| You have one minute, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| has been overruled as having been inappropriately granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| In other words, each time we've urged closer scrutiny of their decision, it has been overturned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| Perhaps greater oversight from this council is necessary to ensure that the infill committee is properly enforcing the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2001)|
| 0:33:28| For today, please uphold the neighborhood's appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| Deny this particular Certificate of Appropriateness as having been improperly granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| Okay, so that concludes the appellants, three speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| We now have the respondents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| And Mr. Seymour, you're listed first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| Mayor, members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| Actually, we now have an accessible podium there, and I believe there's a button you can push if you want that to go higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2034)|
| 0:34:01| I've not tried it yet, but that's what I'm told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| Do you want to adjust that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| I'll leave it as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| I better not try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| I would mess it up if I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| But, yes, this is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| I am here on behalf of Habitat of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| This is the third time, as has been mentioned, that we are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| The last time, as I recall, and members of council who were here then can correct me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2070)|
| 0:34:37| there had been a change in the design of the house from the initial approval by the infill housing design review committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2077)|
| 0:34:47| and you all were being or council was being asked to approve that revised design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2087)|
| 0:34:54| I think the motion at that time was to send back to the infill housing design review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2094)|
| 0:35:02| for their consideration of the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| They did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| That matter was appealed to the Metropolitan Planning Commission at its meeting in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2110)|
| 0:35:19| At that meeting, the Metropolitan Planning Commission, almost unanimously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| I think there was one dissenting vote, denied the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2124)|
| 0:35:31| We're here tonight asking you to deny this appeal at this time because there has been compliance with the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2131)|
| 0:35:41| And I would emphasize the word guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| These guidelines say you should do this, you should do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| They do not say you shall do this or you shall do that or not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2149)|
| 0:35:56| In considering this appeal, this is an administrative appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| You all are not sitting as the legislative body of the city of Knoxville, which you do on, I think, every other agenda item tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2161)|
| 0:36:11| You are considering whether there has been a non-conformance with the infill housing design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2171)|
| 0:36:21| And in doing that, since they do have a certificate of appropriateness, if you agree that there has not been compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2181)|
| 0:36:32| this applicant is entitled to instructions from you all on how they do not agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2192)|
| 0:36:40| So they can go back and correct their design so that they are then in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2200)|
| 0:36:48| And so the motion, if you are going to grant the appeal, is to grant it but with directions to Habitat on what it needs to do to come into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2208)|
| 0:37:02| If your motion is to deny the appeal, you simply say they have complied with the infill housing guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2222)|
| 0:37:11| And I would direct you to Mr. Frost, your attorney, for further direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| On this issue, in connection with the appeal, I would direct you to two documents which I think you have had in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2236)|
| 0:37:25| One is Mr. Jeff Archer's memorandum regarding the compliance with the infill housing guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2245)|
| 0:37:35| Mr. Archer is the staff member with the Metropolitan Planning Commission, and I think he is, well, he is here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2255)|
| 0:37:42| who has dealt with this issue from its outset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| And I think his memorandum totally supports what Habitat is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| There have been numerous changes to the design, and we are asking that these be approved by you denying the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2272)|
| 0:38:02| Also, Mr. Bill Terry with Habitat is here tonight, and he has also submitted a memorandum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2282)|
| 0:38:10| which I think was distributed by Attorney Frost to you all, and I would direct your attention to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2290)|
| 0:38:18| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| One? All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| In addition to presenting the matter to the Infill Housing Design Committee and to the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2303)|
| 0:38:35| Habitat went further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| It retained an architect to review its plans and to review the guidelines and to review the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2317)|
| 0:38:47| Daniel DeFord, who is an advocate for Fort Sanders, is familiar with historic guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| and that's not what we're dealing with here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| Reviewed the neighborhood, the guidelines, and the Habitat plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| and he concurred with the action of the Infill Housing Committee as well as the action of the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2340)|
| 0:39:09| that their plan was compliant with these guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| And for those reasons, I would ask you all to deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| Now, Mr. Terry, thank you for being here, and please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| I'm Bill Terry with Knoxville Habitat for Humanity, 1501 Washington Avenue, Knoxville, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2366)|
| 0:39:34| This has been a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| I'm going to be very short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| I want to thank the Infill Committee, MPC, East Tennessee Design Center, Knox Heritage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| and Randall DeFord for all their help and guidance on the multiple changes we've made to these house plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2384)|
| 0:39:53| The changes, as you can see in the documents, they meet historic guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| so they go above and beyond the overlay for this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2398)|
| 0:40:06| MPC, we believe they've gone above and beyond to serve the community regarding this house design as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| We have confidence in the decisions of MPC and the Infill Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| that they have kept the community in mind based on their considerable expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| But please refer to Jeff Archer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| I would please ask him questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| We deal with him all the time in different infill capacities, different lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| We don't get along on everything, but we come to an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| But I guess he wrote the guidelines or most of it, so he's the expert on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2434)|
| 0:40:42| We had numerous, numerous meetings with the Oakwood-Lincoln Park staff, or some of them were on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2442)|
| 0:40:50| We never got to attend one of their meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| We're never invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| We asked to come to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| They said we could not attend their open meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2455)|
| 0:41:02| So what have we done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| In the last council meeting, George Wallace asked us to go through the process of infill review and MPC review again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| We've done exactly what Mr. Wallace asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| What we did was then when we got with Randall DeFord, he went out to the subdivision, drove around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2474)|
| 0:41:20| looked at everything, and he said that our house plan, our current one that we've applied for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2480)|
| 0:41:28| meets mass scale, which I believe is on the application, and size fits in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2488)|
| 0:41:35| It's a perfect house for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| So the MPC voted 14 to 1 to grant us our third certificate appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2498)|
| 0:41:45| Kim Trent's been involved on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| I know she sent you guys an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| But I just think that we've done all we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| We've made many, many changes to the plans, and I guess this is our final house plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| We also have supporters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| We actually brought the family who's been waiting a year and a half to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| They're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| I'm not sure how much longer they can hold on, but they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| I appreciate them coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| Can everybody put their hands up from Habitat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| We have staff members that live in Oakwood-Lincoln Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| They were never notified of any meetings, any appeals that the association has taken on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| Okay, now the appellants have up to two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| Does someone wish to speak on a rebuttal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2553)|
| 0:42:47| State your name and address again for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| Deborah Brenneman from 423 East Springdale Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2570)|
| 0:42:56| The guidelines may not be mandatory, but they're meaningless if they're disregarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2576)|
| 0:43:05| A couple of factual things I think I need to correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| Habitat has never been barred from a neighborhood meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| They're welcome to attend any time they would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| If they wish to be on the agenda, they need to follow the same procedures as everyone else in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| Contact a board member, ask to be placed on an agenda, and get things scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| We're aware of one meeting at which a Habitat representative arrived, had not told us in advance they wanted to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2602)|
| 0:43:29| and they weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| As with everyone else who shows up to the meeting and just wants time, they don't automatically get time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| Nor are the meetings and appeals about design processes disclosed to the entire neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| People who are interested in design, we certainly don't blanket all of the neighborhood residents with information about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| If any of the Habitat members who live in the neighborhood wanted to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| they can contact our zoning and design committee and get that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| and we'd be happy to welcome them to the extent they care about protecting the historic character of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| I believe that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| Okay, counsel, that concludes the appellants and respondents' opportunity to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2647)|
| 0:44:13| and now it is your time to deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| Councilman Campin, it's your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| We'll start with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| Some of this has been stated, but I'm just going to read it for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| I review the record that's been submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| I'm in agreement that the certificate appropriateness for infill housing should be issued to Habitat for Humanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| I also agree with the MPC staff recommendation of November 27, 2017, that the appeal should be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2671)|
| 0:44:38| The application has been determined to meet the infill guidelines by the Infill Housing Design Review Committee on October 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| Also, this decision was reaffirmed by the Metroland Planning Commission at their meeting on December 14th when this appeal was denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2683)|
| 0:44:50| and I motion to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| Okay, Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| So the motion and the second is to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| I support, obviously, with my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| But more than that, in reviewing this record and looking back at our meetings, our two previous meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2708)|
| 0:45:15| and watching what Habitat has done in trying to come into compliance, which I think they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2715)|
| 0:45:23| I reflect back on my time on the Historic Zoning Commission, which was 20-plus years, and watch this process unfold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2723)|
| 0:45:34| In my opinion, Habitat has adapted and has met the guidelines, I think has already been stated in the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2734)|
| 0:45:45| It's not going to look like every other house, but that's part of the uniqueness, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2745)|
| 0:45:52| and I am going to support this denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| So the last time we heard this, there was a change in the design, as Mr. Seymour stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2761)|
| 0:46:09| and there appeared to be a meeting of the minds, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2769)|
| 0:46:16| but it did not have, at that time, it did not have the changes in the design from infill housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2776)|
| 0:46:24| And so that's when I made the recommendation that we send it back for the certificate of appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| and then the vote by MPC that it was, that everything met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| And I think at that time, I did not, and I felt strongly that council did not want to be in the position of judging that design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2796)|
| 0:46:44| or did we have a meeting of the mind or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| So that was the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| I think that that has been met, it's been vetted out, and, you know, I am not in support of the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2808)|
| 0:47:01| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| Is there somebody from MPC that we can talk to about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| Jeff Archer is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| Jeff, please state your title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| Jeff Archer, principal planner with the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| and serves staff for the Infill Housing Design Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| Thank you, Mr. Archer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| I think what Councilmember Wallace just said is my understanding of what happened at the last meeting as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2846)|
| 0:47:34| and so I wanted to check with you and make sure and ask if the process that's in place for dealing with this particular matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2854)|
| 0:47:42| has been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| Correct, it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| It went through the Infill Housing Design Review Committee and it was voted unanimously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2865)|
| 0:47:54| except for one exception, the East Tennessee Design Center member withheld because he helped as far as showing a schematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2874)|
| 0:48:04| And then it went to the Metropolitan Planning Commission on appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| and voted except for one vote in favor as far as the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2887)|
| 0:48:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| And you're, in fact, the author of the memo that we received in the packet, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| And so that memo, in completing that memo for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| does that take into account all of the available facts and all of the guidelines that would apply in this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2906)|
| 0:48:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| The memo outlines four main things that were on their appeal as far as the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| addressing the mass and scale, the housing orientation, the windows, doors, and the columns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2920)|
| 0:48:49| And what I tried to do, since this had a long history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| I tried to show some of the schematics as far as how the design evolution has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2932)|
| 0:48:59| This process, admittedly, kind of got off to a rocky road, probably because it dealt with a demolition of a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2939)|
| 0:49:06| And I think that probably set the tone throughout, even though this is like the third appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2946)|
| 0:49:14| But since then, I think Habitat has really worked, tried to work with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| and there's been a lot of adjustments through the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| I was struck by one part in your memo where it said, and I may be paraphrasing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2963)|
| 0:49:31| that the guidelines are meant to address a difference that is on a larger scale, not a difference of inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2971)|
| 0:49:39| Is that historically what these guidelines were meant to be enforcing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| As a matter of fact, on the infill guideline on the page where it talks about mass and scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| it visually shows a representation of having, for example, a multitude of one-story houses on a block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=2991)|
| 0:50:00| and then you have a two-story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| It was never intended to be a difference of a foot as far as a height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| It was never meant to be getting a tape measure out to see if it was six inches or 12 inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| It was meant to be driving down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| If it's a two-story versus a one-story, that's out of scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| That's all the questions I have for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3023)|
| 0:50:24| I had some questions for the neighborhood, but I can pass the witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3024)|
| 0:50:32| Can I ask Mr. Archer a couple questions for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| Mr. Archer, can you, because there's, well, first off, this is, we're quasi-judicial here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| We're not making a decision on many other factors, how people feel about each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3043)|
| 0:50:49| how they feel about the house that got demolished, other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| but there's a lot of analogies being drawn or comparisons being made to infill housing versus H1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3053)|
| 0:51:01| I know that's more Kay's arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| I don't know how much you delve into that, but could you kind of explain for everyone the difference between infill versus H1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3064)|
| 0:51:11| I know you serve on infill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| I think, probably given a little recap or a little summarization of where infill came from and its role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3073)|
| 0:51:20| the Heart of Knoxville infill guidelines originally came from a request by the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3080)|
| 0:51:28| and it was actually just covering infill development that was coming through the city with city funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3088)|
| 0:51:35| through Becky's office, community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| And then a neighborhood, Lonsdale, basically wanted added protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| because they were getting some double-wides on a city law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| So basically that creates narrower roof pitches, no windows or doors that face the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3107)|
| 0:51:52| things that aren't very fitting into a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| So we took those same design guidelines and developed into overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| Then Oakwood-Lincoln Park wanted some added protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| because they were seeing some incompatible infill and mainly additions that were incompatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3124)|
| 0:52:13| So during this time, there's been three neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| There's been 239 certificates issued, 121 of them for new structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3136)|
| 0:52:24| There's been 32 issued for new structures in Oakwood-Lincoln Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| 79 in Lonsdale, and three in Edgewood Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| The three neighborhoods it's covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| During this time, there's been four appeals in total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| and three of those four are for this one property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| So the infill housing guidelines and its mission is basically to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3165)|
| 0:52:52| new development or additions are incompatible within the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| The way it's done by the committee is we look essentially at the block face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3178)|
| 0:53:05| to see if it fits into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| If there's a good, strong pattern of historic houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| we use that as the barometer as far as what we look for for new infill development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| If it's not there, we go further out and look at maybe the block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| total block instead of the block face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| And so it's meant to address design that's compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3203)|
| 0:53:29| Also in its mission, since these are in low- to moderate-income neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| the affordability is also a purpose of the infill housing design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3214)|
| 0:53:41| We don't want to have them so stringent that we're not making affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| in these low- to moderate-income neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| So if you look at kind of the scale as far as design stringency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| historic would be, of course, the strongest as far as the design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3235)|
| 0:54:02| the requirements that are needed for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| Next, there's neighborhood conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| And that's something the NPCs on our work program working with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| to have a neighborhood conservation overlay for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| Third would be infill, and then just straight-based zoning would be after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3257)|
| 0:54:25| I hope that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| So does NC1 protect from demolitions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| Like H1 does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| I'm very familiar with H1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| I have a lot of experience with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| But does NC1 protect from demolitions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| There was the ordinance that the city has passed previously as far as demolitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3281)|
| 0:54:52| That has improved the process as far as when a demolition comes across in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| it comes across Kay's desk to see if it's historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| And, unfortunately, the house that was demolished previously, that was something that came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3303)|
| 0:55:09| From this lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| From this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| Is that what you mean? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| So that was actually something that came across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| And there wasn't, at the time, there was a different neighborhood president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| that was involved from the neighborhood, and they were notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| But I don't think that got to the current members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3325)|
| 0:55:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| And then one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| My experience with H1 is that it's not a precedent-setting body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| So I remember having these discussions with Ann Bennett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| I'm not sure I've had them with Kay Graybiel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| But if a decision is made on a particular application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| it's not necessarily a precedent for anything in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| Is that the case with the infill housing committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| When we look at the examples that have been cited of things that have passed the infill housing committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3359)|
| 0:56:07| that might not, in some people's opinions, or meet the guidelines, the Heart of Knoxville guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3367)|
| 0:56:17| those aren't precedent-setting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| Those are my questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| Councilman Roberto, did you want to continue your line of questioning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| Councilor Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| If there's a member from the neighborhood, I'd love to ask a couple questions if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3394)|
| 0:56:44| While you're walking up, the first thing I wanted to say is –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| I live on the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| I cannot speak for the neighborhood association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| So if you need an association, I'll defer to one of the board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| And if someone feels like the question is more appropriate for them, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| The first thing I wanted to just mention is that I really enjoyed –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| you know, there was some discussion about putting the package together and we aren't lawyers and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| And I thought what you did was very excellent, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| Gave a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| I'm also really supportive of seeing neighborhoods get together and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| like you were talking about having your neighbors help you with things that you had going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| Well, this is a similar instance where folks are saying things and they're wanting to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| And so I have to say, you know, congratulations for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| The other thing is that you've dealt with this – you know, we've talked about it three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| And you've made changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| Changes have been made to this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| My first question to you is, you know, we heard that the standard that we're looking at here is guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3467)|
| 0:57:56| and that we're meant to be enforced for something larger than something in inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| And I remember in your – I think it was one of your statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| I think we were maybe five inches off on one of the particular areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3484)|
| 0:58:10| Is that five inches, is that enough of a difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| And I want you to explain to me how that's enough of a difference for this body to make a decision for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3495)|
| 0:58:23| I think the five inches comes from exterior wall height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| And on its own, that might not be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| It's our view that the combination of the exterior wall height and the overall width of the proposal yields a mass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3511)|
| 0:58:40| and scale overall that just appears much smaller than any of the original houses on the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| Like we said, it most closely resembles the dimensions of the brick house on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3526)|
| 0:58:52| If you're looking for a reference to that, I think it's page 235 in the packet that you guys had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3532)|
| 0:58:58| I have a picture of that brick house on the corner and the original Victorian that stood next to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| and the craftsman on the other side, which is still there to this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| And if we add another house that's the same size as the squat brick house on the corner, we now have two short houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3546)|
| 0:59:14| The info guidelines specifically say that the original houses tried to look tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| And so five inches by itself might not make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| But I think combined with the overall design, it does make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| Because individual design elements don't exist in isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| They're part of the whole plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| If there was an amendment to the plan and that five inches was added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3572)|
| 0:59:40| would the neighborhood be in support of this plan at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| Or is there some other element?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| I can't speak for the neighborhood or to buy them in any way on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| And when this council last heard this appeal or about this matter, since that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3594)|
| 1:00:04| has the neighborhood met with Habitat for Humanity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| What efforts did, from the neighbor's perspective, did they attempt to have contact with Habitat for Humanity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3612)|
| 1:00:23| I'm not entirely sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| I mean, I'm happy to clarify the posture of the previous appeal here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| but I'm not aware of subsequent efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| Of course, when we came to city council last time, Habitat had filed the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| MPC had already found that the plan did not comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| And instead of coming here to say that MPC had gotten something wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| they said, we have a brand new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| You can approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| And that plan was different than the plan they had showed us the day before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| and was also different than the plan they subsequently submitted to the infill design committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| which is the plan that you're now considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| Which is why it was sent back, so it could go through the process, which it's now done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| And by the time it started that process, it had changed yet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| At this point, I think most of the neighborhood residents who worked on this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3668)|
| 1:01:14| feel that meeting with Habitat has become unproductive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| because they seek to claim that there has been an agreement anytime we meet on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3678)|
| 1:01:24| An example of this is when 317 East Springdale was suggested as a model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3684)|
| 1:01:30| And then that was agreed at a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| It could be used as a model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| I think Jeff may have been the one who suggested it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| It's a craftsman-style house, a later-style house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| The next plan they brought us did not match 317,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| but they claimed we had to agree to it because they had used 317 as a model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| And so we feel that it's very hard to work with them because anything we say is used against us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3708)|
| 1:01:56| And again, the design elements don't exist in isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| It's part of a whole plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| We need a cohesive house for this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| Well, and so as this process has gone through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| if you're looking at the first iteration of this versus the one that you're seeing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3732)|
| 1:02:19| has there been improvement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| Today's plan is far better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| And so what I would like to, and I'm going to let other folks ask questions too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| what I'd like to tell you is that in and of itself is a victory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| No matter what happens tonight, the activity that the neighborhood, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3753)|
| 1:02:39| all the energy you've expended in this, that's a victory right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| But thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3765)|
| 1:02:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| We do want to make a correction on a previous statement that was made in response to a question from Councilwoman Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3767)|
| 1:02:53| and our law director is going to correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| Yeah, the question whether or not there was protection in an NC1 neighborhood on demolition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| and the answer to that is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| You have to have a certificate of appropriateness for any demolition when it's zoned NC1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| There's also the, if someone applies for NC1 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| then there's a 180-day moratorium and that whole scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| So there is protection against demolition for NC1 neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| So the two tools we have to prevent demolition are NC1 and H1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3800)|
| 1:03:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| It's a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| The delay, it's not a moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| Yeah, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| It's not necessarily a moratorium in an H1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| It's a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| You have to get to the final straw in an H1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| Well, there is a delay, as I recall, of a certain age, maybe 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3822)|
| 1:03:49| Yeah, if it's under the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| There's a state statute that requires a delay if it's over, it's like 1850 or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3832)|
| 1:04:01| if it's billed around 1850 or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| Well, I thought it was 50-year age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| It may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| You may be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| To me, that seems like 1850.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| I'm so young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| I don't have a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| but I do just want to reiterate something that I just heard Councilman Roberto say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| to really thank the neighborhood for the effort that you've put into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| and also to thank Habitat for, you know, working towards a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3863)|
| 1:04:30| I think it's particularly important to note, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| that neighborhood organizations and the individuals who are engaged don't get paid for their time to work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3872)|
| 1:04:40| I think it's important that we all take note that our neighborhoods are asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| and kind of demanding that we up our game as far as development that's coming into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3885)|
| 1:04:52| This particular development, I've reviewed all the documentation and looked at past meetings and watched the videos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3892)|
| 1:04:59| It does appear to me that what's happened is that it does meet the guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| and that is due in part to the work that the neighborhood has put into making sure that Habitat reaches that bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3903)|
| 1:05:11| So, again, whatever happens tonight, I don't want the neighborhood to be discouraged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3911)|
| 1:05:18| and, you know, please keep up those volunteer efforts to make sure that our city continues to grow in a way that we all value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3918)|
| 1:05:27| Councilman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| So I asked a couple of questions about NC1 and H1 and Enfield because, although we're deciding one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3930)|
| 1:05:37| we are only deciding here whether we agree with whether the guidelines were met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3937)|
| 1:05:44| And I feel like, you know, it needs to be addressed and spoken about that this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3944)|
| 1:05:50| and other neighborhoods are very concerned about demolition, the creation of an Enfield lot at the cost of another house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3950)|
| 1:05:58| And I think that we are partially here tonight because there's ill will and want to see the Victorian that's gone and it's lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3958)|
| 1:06:09| And, unfortunately, nothing we decide here tonight is going to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| And so that's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| And I think we have to look forward and work together in the future to avoid that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3975)|
| 1:06:20| and work for all of our neighborhoods to not tear down houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| And I know there's the sides that say the demolition is unavoidable, this is not rehabable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3985)|
| 1:06:31| I'm very aware that that's subjective and not objective, and, unfortunately, there are no measures to figure, you know, per se, that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| Not reasonable and affordable measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| I have been through multiple processes of applying for buildings and structures and modifications to be approved at the H-1 process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4001)|
| 1:06:52| I've been a part of them as a president of a neighborhood, as a property owner, and rehabbing properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4012)|
| 1:06:59| And what I see in the H-1 process, and I want to say this because I see a lot of people making comparables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4019)|
| 1:07:06| is there was a lot of give and take any time an application came to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| If somebody proposes an Enfield house, it's a big discussion, and sometimes people don't like people's opinions because they are opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4031)|
| 1:07:19| It's subjective, not objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| You get your experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| Sometimes the experts don't agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| But everyone that's been passed has been give and take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| It's never been a precision match where it meets this, this, and this within a small few inches or less than a foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4050)|
| 1:07:39| And that's just never been part of our discussion, and I've been doing this for about 12 years with H-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4059)|
| 1:07:46| And we have lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| We had an example of this a few weeks ago at Historic Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| The neighborhood was opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| A lot of neighbors were opposed, longtime neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| A lot of neighbors were in favor of it, and it passed unanimously at Historic Zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| And there was a lot of question, much more pronounced about mass and scale and other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4083)|
| 1:08:11| And it wasn't prescribed, like, you must meet all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| There were some give and take options to be able to meet, to be able to pass the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4095)|
| 1:08:22| So that it would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| And it ended up passing unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| So when I look at these guidelines and review them, I think it's important to note, as Mr. Archer suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4107)|
| 1:08:35| that it's not a precedent-setting body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| I do agree that some of the earlier projects that are in here that might have gotten a COA from the Infill Housing Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4118)|
| 1:08:45| don't meet the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| But what I see when I look through here, from my experience with H1, is that they have met them in this particular third rendition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4127)|
| 1:09:00| I have looked at, I've driven around personally, and I've used Google Street View to examine properties up and down that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4140)|
| 1:09:08| I do see bad examples on that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| But this one meets within inches of the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| And I do understand when you say a full and total package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| We've dealt with that in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| I think, you know, I'm just having a hard time coming up with a reason to say that it doesn't meet the infill guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4164)|
| 1:09:32| when I look at the different components, like porches and stoops and mass and scale and on down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4172)|
| 1:09:39| And having done that myself before and worked with historic zoning and those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| So that's kind of where I stand on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| I also want to thank the Oakwood-Lincoln Park community for the work that you've put in and for actually being here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4190)|
| 1:09:56| My question is actually for Habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| I would like to know what is Habitat's experience in rehabbing existing houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4199)|
| 1:10:07| We do currently have a rehab program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| And we probably do four or five a year that we do rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4210)|
| 1:10:16| This particular house, it should be in your notes that as soon as we purchased the property, we had a surveyor come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4216)|
| 1:10:24| And in the survey it says the house was not repairable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| That's why we tore it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| I talked to Kay about that actually today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| And she said that it probably would have taken an engineer's letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| I'm not sure if our surveyor is a professional engineer with the State of Tennessee, but he is a licensed surveyor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4236)|
| 1:10:44| But we do rehab houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| I think there are a lot of good people involved on all sides right now trying to do what is best for themselves and for families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4254)|
| 1:11:04| This is an issue that's going to come up more and more because it's hitting on affordability as well, aesthetics versus affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4264)|
| 1:11:16| The factors that come into play are, you know, desirability to live in a neighborhood, market value, property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4276)|
| 1:11:26| And this is going to keep coming up because we need to find a different way to look at some of these things if we're going to make affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4286)|
| 1:11:35| I think today what we're looking at are the guidelines, and I think it does fulfill the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| Mr. Terry, I have just a quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| The same one I asked the neighborhood, which was, you know, since the last council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4307)|
| 1:11:52| what efforts has Habitat for Humanity gone through to get in touch with the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| Once the drawings, we had them redrawn, one of our staff members went to Michelle Ivester's home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4318)|
| 1:12:06| hand-delivered them, went to Deb Thomas' home, and anybody else to their houses and brought a full set of plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4326)|
| 1:12:17| Was there ever an attempt to have a meeting with the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| They never contacted us, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| So what I'm hearing is that Habitat didn't attempt to schedule a meeting with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4343)|
| 1:12:29| and the neighborhood didn't attempt to schedule a meeting with Habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| And I'm not sure how that makes working together work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| Well, prior to the last council meeting, we actually pushed it out a month because they couldn't meet with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4357)|
| 1:12:46| We wanted to meet with them and go over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| So we pulled it out, we pulled our drawing out, we pushed it out a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| The only time they could meet was September the 11th, which was the night before the council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| Kim Trent went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| She was our moderator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| Jeff Archer, Craig Graybill was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| Habitat staff, about five or six of the members of Oakwood Lincoln Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4389)|
| 1:13:14| And the president, who is Molly Conaway, is what I've been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| We met with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| They didn't like some ideas, and I just laid it out there and said, what do you want us to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4402)|
| 1:13:28| But that was the September meeting, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| And so since then, there have been no attempts by either side to have a meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| No, besides us delivering, hand-delivering plans to their homes and giving them to them, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| And the last comment I'll make is that I really appreciate what Habitat does for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4422)|
| 1:13:50| and I'm glad you brought the family here that's going to be housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4430)|
| 1:13:56| What I'd like to see going forward is a neighborhood meeting with a developer in this case, which is Habitat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4436)|
| 1:14:07| because I think that can save us all the time that's gone into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| This has happened three times, and both parties need to be willing to come together and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| I personally think that when we have that kind of a conversation, no matter how difficult it might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4458)|
| 1:14:25| we can get to a better solution, and I think that that needs to be the standard going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| We've had good discussion, and I would call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| Since there are no more lights, we will go ahead and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| So the motion is to deny the appeal, so this can be confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| If you vote aye, that means you're supporting Habitat's position tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4491)|
| 1:14:57| The motion is to deny the appeal of the neighborhood, so you vote aye if you wish to support Habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4497)|
| 1:15:04| You vote no if you agree with the neighborhood organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| Does everybody understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| Okay, so we'll try it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| So it's unanimously in support of denying the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| So the motion to deny the appeal passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| 11A is a resolution authorizing the acquisition, by condemnation if necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4530)|

| 1:15:49| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4551)|

| 1:19:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4764)|
| 1:19:25| I would like for Jim York to come and give us an explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4768)|
| 1:19:29| He's been waiting to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4769)|
| 1:19:30| Waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4770)|
| 1:19:39| Waiting with bated breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| Jim York, finance director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| What you have before you is an ordinance to amend the current year budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| There are four parts to this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| Get us a little closer to him, if you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| There are four parts to this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| The largest part is what we call a housekeeping type of arrangement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4797)|
| 1:20:03| whereby we reappropriate anything that was encumbered at the end of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| and that's just a standard practice in governmental budgeting to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4808)|
| 1:20:15| The second piece is to appropriate unspent and unencumbered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4815)|
| 1:20:22| these are unencumbered funds, in the historic preservation fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| and that's pretty sizable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| The third piece is just shifting some appropriations between departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4829)|
| 1:20:38| For at least three of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| we recall that there was a budget amendment done, I think, in October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| where we added $500,000 to address some of the homelessness concerns in the Broadway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4845)|
| 1:20:55| At that time, we budgeted all in public service department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| because we weren't sure how we were going to allocate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4859)|
| 1:21:03| What we've done now is we're going to split some of the expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| between the service department and the community development department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| and we're just reducing the service department by $350,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| and increasing the community development by $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| So that's just, again, just shifting funds between departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| The final piece is to provide a grant of $25,000 to the Big Ears Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4883)|
| 1:21:32| I know the mayor has sent out an email to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| Basically, the Big Ears Festival is a major event in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4897)|
| 1:21:46| At the time last year when we do the agency grant awards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| Big Ears was not incorporated as a 501c3 and, therefore, wasn't eligible to receive a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4911)|
| 1:21:58| It's my understanding that they have received that designation now and can receive a grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4918)|
| 1:22:04| and this budget increases that for $25,000 for that festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4924)|
| 1:22:12| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| I just wanted to acknowledge that Ashley Capps is here from Big Ears, so thanks for coming tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| I'm proud he's in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| And he's willing to answer any questions if you have it, but he'll also – we're almost to the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| so he may even be here when we're over if you want to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| Okay, so I see no further lights, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4960)|

| 1:22:50| The first is Ted Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4970)|
| 1:22:51| Is Ted here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| Mr. Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| He phoned in, so he may not have made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| Okay, so we'll scratch him off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| And Barbara Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| Thank you, ma'am, for being here, sitting through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| Please state your name and address for the record, and I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| And as I'm sure you know, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4992)|
| 1:23:13| My name is Barbara Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4993)|
| 1:23:14| I live at 4221 Chinquapin Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=4994)|
| 1:23:21| I'm here tonight to read into the record the e-mail that I sent to this body on January 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=5001)|
| 1:23:29| I would have been here at the last meeting, but y'all are, I wasn't really thinking that you would be meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=5009)|
| 1:23:35| and you're tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| So I stayed home on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| But in any case, this is very important to me to make sure that it's on the record, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=5020)|
| 1:23:48| And without further ado, with this e-mail, I am requesting the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=5028)|
| 1:23:56| and the Knoxville City Council use whatever methods and powers they have at their disposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=5036)|
| 1:24:03| to extract from Helen Ross McNabb the specific procedures that will be used to ensure the safety of the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=5043)|

| 1:24:23| on DeWine Road in Knoxville, and to communicate that information immediately and unilaterally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=5063)|
| 1:24:32| It is with great disappointment that I find myself having to correspond with these bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=5072)|
| 1:24:39| to attempt to receive the cooperation and communication that should be afforded citizens who have respectfully requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=5079)|
| 1:24:47| information regarding a government-funded operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180130?start=5087)|
