| 2:36:19| In the medium to long term, this will restrict availability of affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9379)|
| 2:36:23| particularly missing middle and workforce housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9383)|
| 2:36:26| right at a time when the city is facing an affordable housing shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9386)|
| 2:36:31| And in regards to the ADUs, the accessory dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9391)|
| 2:36:36| I advocate that they not be determined based on the size of the current dwelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9396)|
| 2:36:44| but that the overall lot size be considered instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9404)|
| 2:36:48| All of this literally translates to a lack of diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9408)|
| 2:36:51| I want to live in a city that is truly a home for all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9411)|
| 2:36:54| and this is not how Knoxville was portrayed to us by members of the UTK community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9414)|
| 2:36:58| one of Knoxville's largest employers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9418)|
| 2:37:00| And like UT, we want to make sure the orange is visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9420)|
| 2:37:04| I'm also asking that you allow for one more round of public comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9424)|
| 2:37:08| It is not hard to understand how the midterm elections are affecting people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9428)|
| 2:37:13| The first draft that was open to public comment came out in the spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9433)|
| 2:37:17| when people were heavily involved in the primary cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9437)|
| 2:37:19| and now these comments are coinciding with the start of a major election season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9439)|
| 2:37:23| Seeing the map and having the visual has helped to engage more people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9443)|
| 2:37:30| and the recode is something most of us will only have one time in our lifetime to participate in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9450)|
| 2:37:37| and I hope you can understand how one more round of public comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9457)|
| 2:37:40| could be a positive outcome for something so relevant to so many people's futures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9460)|
| 2:37:45| Like was mentioned, the map was just released August 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9465)|
| 2:37:48| and so I think it's really important that we have another comment period when the draft ends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9468)|
| 2:37:54| which I understand now people continue to comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9474)|
| 2:37:57| but that doesn't mean it will be incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9477)|
| 2:37:59| So what happens in the city limits affects Knoxville as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9479)|
| 2:38:03| People and families like ours are relocating to the area because of all it has to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9483)|
| 2:38:08| The heart of Knoxville is the city, and even though hearts are red,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9488)|
| 2:38:11| it's clear that we bleed orange in eastern Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9491)|
| 2:38:14| and we ask that you put the orange on the city map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9494)|
| 2:38:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9497)|
| 2:38:18| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9498)|
| 2:38:21| Elizabeth Rowland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9501)|
| 2:38:29| Please give us your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9509)|
| 2:38:32| Hi. My name is Sarah Elizabeth Rowland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9512)|
| 2:38:35| I go by Elizabeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9515)|
| 2:38:36| I am at 615 Balsam Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9516)|
| 2:38:40| I prepared some comments beforehand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9520)|
| 2:38:43| but the interesting and dynamic conversation here had me rewriting a lot of things during this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9523)|
| 2:38:49| so bear with me as I try to figure out my chicken scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9529)|
| 2:38:52| Obviously I'm dressed all in orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9532)|
| 2:38:54| I'm with the Knox County Democratic Party Progressive Action Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9534)|
| 2:38:57| I also believe in bringing the orange back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9537)|
| 2:39:00| And I wanted to respond a little bit to something that Mr. Green said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9540)|
| 2:39:06| about how the R2 in the 60s was potentially established under discriminatory intentions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9546)|
| 2:39:15| and that they didn't want to continue that kind of discriminatory intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9555)|
| 2:39:22| However, I don't understand how getting rid of multifamily housing makes it less discriminatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9562)|
| 2:39:32| To make it less discriminatory would be able to have more affordable housing in more areas of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9572)|
| 2:39:37| rather than just getting rid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9577)|
| 2:39:39| Because if we get rid of it, if we remove the orange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9579)|
| 2:39:42| then where are those people going to go that need affordable housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9582)|
| 2:39:46| They're going to go outside of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9586)|
| 2:39:48| We don't want concentrations inside the city or outside the city of low income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9588)|
| 2:39:55| We want it dispersed around in all neighborhoods so that we can have equal opportunity for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9595)|
| 2:40:04| I also related to Councilmember Welch's struggle with balancing the teardowns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9604)|
| 2:40:11| and the loss of small affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9611)|
| 2:40:14| I don't think I'm allowed to ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9614)|
| 2:40:16| but I'm curious what about teardown restrictions are happening in the recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9616)|
| 2:40:24| Is there anything or what happened to the infill housing guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9624)|
| 2:40:29| Maybe some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9629)|
| 2:40:30| I'm wondering if there's been conversations about how that could help mitigate some of those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9630)|
| 2:40:36| That is something that the PAC, the Progressive Action Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9636)|
| 2:40:39| has not had time to explore very much because of the limited time of this whole process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9639)|
| 2:40:47| and I'll get more into that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9647)|
| 2:40:51| Regarding ADUs, Councilmember Roberto asked about why not make an owner-occupied requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9651)|
| 2:41:00| In my view, that sort of defeats the purpose of having ADUs at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9660)|
| 2:41:05| because the idea is to allow more diverse housing options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9665)|
| 2:41:09| That includes rental and owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9669)|
| 2:41:12| If you just have owner-occupied, you're basically increasing the cost of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9672)|
| 2:41:17| without having alternative income source for the owner that would make it affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9677)|
| 2:41:23| It also limits options for renters that could want to live in that ADU in that desirable neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9683)|
| 2:41:31| and because we placed those restrictions, they no longer can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9691)|
| 2:41:35| So I think I just wanted to throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9695)|
| 2:41:39| Mr. Green mentioned needing help from the community to identify locations for RN-3, RN-4, RN-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9699)|
| 2:41:49| Our group has walked several neighborhoods trying to do just that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9709)|
| 2:41:53| and in our comments we highlighted three neighborhoods that are along commercial corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9713)|
| 2:41:59| that are within walking distance of those commercial corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9719)|
| 2:42:03| and that already have multifamily housing in those neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9723)|
| 2:42:08| and they are zoned RN-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9728)|
| 2:42:14| And some of them were downzoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9734)|
| 2:42:16| Like you had mentioned Oakwood-Lincoln Park, that neighborhood has lots of duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9736)|
| 2:42:22| lots of multifamily housing in it already, so why downzone it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9742)|
| 2:42:29| I live in Fountain City, and we are in walking distance of North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9749)|
| 2:42:37| And my neighborhood is the same as I just mentioned with Oakwood-Lincoln Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9757)|
| 2:42:45| Regarding comments, I would also like to ask that we have a whole other round of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9765)|
| 2:42:51| So far we've only had one session, one round of comments for commenting on the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9771)|
| 2:42:55| which is an extremely important part of this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9775)|
| 2:42:58| and it's really not acceptable to only have one round of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9778)|
| 2:43:03| And I know there was the statement that we could comment later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9783)|
| 2:43:06| but if there's not time to incorporate those comments into the recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9786)|
| 2:43:10| what's the point of commenting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9790)|
| 2:43:12| I spent like 24 hours in the past three days writing our comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9792)|
| 2:43:15| and I don't want to do that if it's not going to actually go into the recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9795)|
| 2:43:19| So I guess that is about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9799)|
| 2:43:26| So I appreciate all the work that MPC has put into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9806)|
| 2:43:29| and that the city council has put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9809)|
| 2:43:31| It's clear you're taking this seriously with your questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9811)|
| 2:43:34| and I encourage you to bring back the orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9814)|
| 2:43:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9817)|
| 2:43:38| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9818)|
| 2:43:40| Next is Keith Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9820)|
| 2:43:43| Vice Mayor Saunders, while Mr. Britt is coming, I don't know where the ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9823)|
| 2:43:48| maybe it was our mistake in setting the deadline for draft two of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9828)|
| 2:43:52| and draft one of the map was a certain date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9832)|
| 2:43:54| As I've stated and as we state on our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9834)|
| 2:43:57| there will be a comment period after the next draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9837)|
| 2:44:00| I don't know where that misconception came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9840)|
| 2:44:02| I apologize if it was our fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9842)|
| 2:44:04| But, again, there will be another round of public comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9844)|
| 2:44:07| I've stated that a couple of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9847)|
| 2:44:10| and just maybe that will cut off some of the comments here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9850)|
| 2:44:15| But, again, there will be another round| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9855)|
| 2:44:17| before the final draft is presented to you or MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9857)|
| 2:44:20| and I'm sure there will be several more rounds after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9860)|
| 2:44:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9863)|
| 2:44:24| Mr. Britt, if you would give us your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9864)|
| 2:44:27| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9867)|
| 2:44:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9868)|
| 2:44:29| Keith Britt, 558 Milton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9869)|
| 2:44:31| Because you couldn't be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9871)|
| 2:44:32| I would just like to point you to Lakinia Middlebrook's analysis of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9872)|
| 2:44:38| If you search the public comments on the RICO Knoxville site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9878)|
| 2:44:41| just search on her name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9881)|
| 2:44:44| The NAACP Housing Committee put together just ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9884)|
| 2:44:47| I mean, if you're a nerd, their presentation on this is just awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9887)|
| 2:44:51| It's data‑driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9891)|
| 2:44:52| It's elegant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9892)|
| 2:44:53| I love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9893)|
| 2:44:54| So please look that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9894)|
| 2:44:55| I know that because I've read and analyzed, as of this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9895)|
| 2:44:59| all 342 of the public feedback comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9899)|
| 2:45:01| and all 355 of the MAP feedback comments on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9901)|
| 2:45:06| The vast majority of these comments concern what is perceived to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9906)|
| 2:45:11| a clash between maintaining private single family home values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9911)|
| 2:45:16| and increasing the availability of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9916)|
| 2:45:19| This is a false choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9919)|
| 2:45:21| Affordable housing and single family home values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9921)|
| 2:45:24| are not mutually exclusive or zero sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9924)|
| 2:45:28| You as a city council can address both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9928)|
| 2:45:32| I believe this false narrative has been perpetrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9932)|
| 2:45:34| or at least exasperated because of the ill‑defined goals in Draft 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9934)|
| 2:45:45| I believe we're trying to circumvent what Knoxville's real growth problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9945)|
| 2:45:50| I won't read all the goals of Draft 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9950)|
| 2:45:52| but they're in Article 1.2 if you want to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9952)|
| 2:45:54| You can notice that Draft 2 violates several of these goals intentionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9954)|
| 2:45:57| most notably preserving open space, reducing traffic congestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9957)|
| 2:46:01| preserving quality of life, and the elimination of nonconformities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9961)|
| 2:46:05| More importantly, though, and this was mentioned by the MPC director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9965)|
| 2:46:09| it does not state that we need to increase affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9969)|
| 2:46:15| You can twist a couple of the goals to make it say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9975)|
| 2:46:18| but it's not clear or concise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9978)|
| 2:46:22| The first step of making this recode work is to clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9982)|
| 2:46:24| and explicitly state the goals so we can see that the actions being taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9984)|
| 2:46:28| line up with the purpose of the recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9988)|
| 2:46:30| Right now we don't have this tool, so it objectively looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9990)|
| 2:46:33| there are influences on this process that we are not privy to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9993)|
| 2:46:36| and those parties don't have our best interest in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9996)|
| 2:46:39| The second problem with this recode is it's trying to solve a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=9999)|
| 2:46:43| that has much deeper roots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10003)|
| 2:46:45| With the shortage of available land within city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10005)|
| 2:46:48| simple supply and demand says that no matter how you do this recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10008)|
| 2:46:52| if we don't increase the land available, housing prices are going to keep going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10012)|
| 2:46:57| I call this the San Francisco problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10017)|
| 2:46:59| but where they're bordered on many sides by water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10019)|
| 2:47:03| we're floating in an ocean of state government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10023)|
| 2:47:07| That's your real problem with the ballooning population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10027)|
| 2:47:10| is the Tennessee State 108th General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10030)|
| 2:47:15| They removed your ability to annex agricultural property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10035)|
| 2:47:17| without the permission of a landowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10037)|
| 2:47:19| and your ability to annex any other property without landowner permission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10039)|
| 2:47:22| or a ballot referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10042)|
| 2:47:27| Annexation is the solution to your growth problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10047)|
| 2:47:30| and annexation is the solution to affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10050)|
| 2:47:34| I think this recode is worthwhile and should go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10054)|
| 2:47:38| but please don't try and make a square peg go in a round hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10058)|
| 2:47:42| This recode can help small business promotion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10062)|
| 2:47:44| it can create a more walkable community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10064)|
| 2:47:46| and it can protect the quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10066)|
| 2:47:48| It cannot solve the affordable housing problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10068)|
| 2:47:51| State law will need to be changed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10071)|
| 2:47:54| You obviously don't have power over this state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10074)|
| 2:47:57| but I suggest you do what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10077)|
| 2:48:00| Start making us think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10080)|
| 2:48:03| Talk about how the state has restricted your ability to expand the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10083)|
| 2:48:09| My representatives are Eddie Smith and Becky Massey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10089)|
| 2:48:13| I'd be more than happy to make you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10093)|
| 2:48:15| or help you communicate to them that that was a bad decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10095)|
| 2:48:20| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10100)|
| 2:48:21| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10101)|
| 2:48:23| Next is Deborah Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10103)|
| 2:48:35| Ms. Thomas, if you'd give us your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10115)|
| 2:48:37| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10117)|
| 2:48:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10118)|
| 2:48:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10120)|
| 2:48:41| I thought I was going to be the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10121)|
| 2:48:42| No, we've got one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10122)|
| 2:48:44| My name is Deborah Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10124)|
| 2:48:45| I live at 428 East Burwell Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10125)|
| 2:48:48| I serve as the Oakwood-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10128)|
| 2:48:52| We have active members attending Broadway Corridor Task Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10132)|
| 2:48:56| Uptown North branding meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10136)|
| 2:48:58| as well as the North Knox Business and Professional Association meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10138)|
| 2:49:02| Thank you to council members for allowing me to speak tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10142)|
| 2:49:05| and thank you for tackling recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10145)|
| 2:49:07| I realize that codes need to be updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10147)|
| 2:49:10| Our neighborhood has needed updates for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10150)|
| 2:49:13| The streets of Lincoln Park were built as trolley suburbs in the early 1900s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10153)|
| 2:49:17| Although there were sewers and sidewalks during construction in many areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10157)|
| 2:49:21| the neighborhood was built before the automobile became king.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10161)|
| 2:49:25| The streets are narrow and made more so by on-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10165)|
| 2:49:29| There are areas in Lincoln Park where it's difficult to back out of your driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10169)|
| 2:49:32| if you're lucky enough to have one, because someone has parked across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10172)|
| 2:49:37| Our lots are small with modest, single-family houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10177)|
| 2:49:42| Many lots do not have off-street parking or driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10182)|
| 2:49:45| The area is situated between the First and Second Creek watersheds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10185)|
| 2:49:48| and has aging infrastructure as far as stormwater drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10188)|
| 2:49:52| This is available in the MPC archives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10192)|
| 2:49:55| under the Oakwood-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association plan from 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10195)|
| 2:50:01| Dramatically increasing density would further stress our infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10201)|
| 2:50:05| Oakwood-Lincoln Park is a mix of R1A and R2 at present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10205)|
| 2:50:09| but it has been the intent of neighborhood leaders for over ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10209)|
| 2:50:12| to zone it more consistently as R1A, which will fit with the RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10212)|
| 2:50:18| The Draft 1 map showing the designation for RN2 zoning for our residential sections is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10218)|
| 2:50:23| Our members support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10223)|
| 2:50:25| Our neighborhood was intended to be single-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10225)|
| 2:50:27| It is adapted with some duplexes, triplexes, and apartment complexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10227)|
| 2:50:31| that offer increased varieties of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10231)|
| 2:50:33| Designating large sections of the neighborhood with higher-density zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10233)|
| 2:50:37| such as RN3 to RN5, puts Oakwood-Lincoln Park affordable single-family housing stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10237)|
| 2:50:43| at risk for demolition by developers that would install multifamily dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10243)|
| 2:50:48| Oakwood-Lincoln Park residents support local small businesses, revitalization, and preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10248)|
| 2:50:54| We want sustainable, smart development that avoids demolition wherever possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10254)|
| 2:50:59| We also have a lot of support from neighbors for keeping some type of infill design guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10259)|
| 2:51:04| City code consultants have been clear that the code covers setbacks and not design issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10264)|
| 2:51:09| This means that new housing will not be required to have porch styles and front facades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10269)|
| 2:51:13| that will blend with our existing historic-era architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10273)|
| 2:51:17| This issue impacts not only Oakwood-Lincoln Park, but Lonsdale and Edgewood neighborhoods as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10277)|
| 2:51:23| So that is over 4,000 residents that would be impacted if the infill design guidelines are thrown out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10283)|
| 2:51:29| And to clarify what the prior speaker said, infill design does not protect from demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10289)|
| 2:51:35| You have to be under neighborhood conservation overlay or historic overlay to have those protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10295)|
| 2:51:41| We have several pages of petitions to present regarding this effort to keep infill design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10301)|
| 2:51:46| if there's anyone up there that I can bring them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10306)|
| 2:51:48| And thank you for listening to all of our concerns tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10308)|
| 2:51:52| Thank you, Ms. Thomas. You can bring that to the city recorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10312)|
| 2:51:58| Okay, next is Carlene Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10318)|
| 2:52:01| Ms. Malone, you know the drill, so we haven't heard from you in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10321)|
| 2:52:09| Thank you, Vice Mayor. Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10329)|
| 2:52:13| I'm going to try to respond to some of the things that were discussed this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10333)|
| 2:52:19| First of all, this is planning for the future, 30, 50 years out, there's no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10339)|
| 2:52:24| But as has been said, it's not a static document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10344)|
| 2:52:27| And unless you have a crystal ball, I suggest we move carefully with this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10347)|
| 2:52:36| We don't know what 30 or 50 years out looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10356)|
| 2:52:41| We know trends, and we should move in those directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10361)|
| 2:52:45| But I think we need to do it with some humility, and we need to pay attention to our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10365)|
| 2:52:50| As the last speaker just said, neighborhoods are very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10370)|
| 2:52:55| I live in a neighborhood, I have an acre and a third, my neighbors have a half acre, an acre, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10375)|
| 2:53:00| The house behind me, it's in Fountain City, it's not a she-she neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10380)|
| 2:53:04| The house behind me, talk about affordable housing, sold for a little over $100,000 a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10384)|
| 2:53:10| It's on a big lot, there's a lovely family that's moved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10390)|
| 2:53:16| We treasure our neighborhood. We treasure the condition it's in and as it sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10396)|
| 2:53:21| In the future, it certainly will be something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10401)|
| 2:53:24| But right now, we have two 90-degree turns with six houses in between, and that's counting them on both sides of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10404)|
| 2:53:33| The pavement ends in ditches, and the pavement is deep ditches, and the pavement is too narrow to stripe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10413)|
| 2:53:40| That's not an area that requires increased density at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10420)|
| 2:53:46| When you're ready to come out and build us some sidewalks and get us more than a mile away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10426)|
| 2:53:51| get us a little closer than being a mile away from mass transit, I think density and an increase in density makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10431)|
| 2:53:58| But at this point, it doesn't. All neighborhoods are not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10438)|
| 2:54:03| The infrastructure is different, the location is different, the distance from major corridors and major employment centers, everything is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10443)|
| 2:54:11| And development needs to be at least aware of those differences, and they should impact the nature of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10451)|
| 2:54:22| I was amused listening to the difficulty in the definitions of low density, medium density, and high density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10462)|
| 2:54:29| This council in March approved the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10469)|
| 2:54:32| One-year plan defines each one of those very clearly, very precisely, using numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10472)|
| 2:54:38| Low density is less than six dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10478)|

| 2:55:13| It is not the same as a kennel, and animal breeder does not comport with the city code having to do with animal control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10513)|
| 2:55:22| which speaks specifically about a kennel, and directs the reader to the zoning ordinance to see in which zone you can have a kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10522)|
| 2:55:35| Animal breeder, and the reason I say it's an enforcement nightmare, you don't just have to count the number of dogs over the age of six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10535)|
| 2:55:43| You have to establish that the operation is for commercial gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10543)|
| 2:55:49| And I don't know if Mr. Aarons is interested in running stings operations to see if the guy's charging and has a commercial gain or has a hobby going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10549)|

| 2:56:13| There are no standards at present as proposed for in-home daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10573)|
| 2:56:18| We're not arguing about one kid, six or seven, plus the kids living in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10578)|
| 2:56:24| In-home daycare is what somebody can have next door to you in a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10584)|
| 2:56:28| Right now, our ordinance says if you have six, plus your own, you're good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10588)|
| 2:56:33| You don't need any approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10593)|
| 2:56:34| But if you have seven or more, plus your own, you need use on review approval, and then standards kick in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10594)|
| 2:56:42| That's totally gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10602)|
| 2:56:44| When it comes to home occupation, the 25% rule is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10604)|
| 2:56:52| We're not talking live-work development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10612)|
| 2:56:55| We're talking in a single-family residential district who can operate a business next to you, whether or not they can sell what they're not producing on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10615)|
| 2:57:06| How difficult is it to enforce 25%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10626)|
| 2:57:09| It's like everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180920c?start=10629)|
