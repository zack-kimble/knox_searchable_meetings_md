| 0:05:52| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| All right. I am Pace Robinson. I'm the current chairman of the board of the KUB Board of Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| and I live at 1607 Nyberg Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| I want to thank you for taking the time, for allowing us to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| and to hear more about all this hard work that's gone on over the past several months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| concerning the tree trimming issues in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| As you may know, the KUB Board of Commissioners is comprised of seven commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| We are appointed by the mayor and approved by city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| and our terms are for seven years each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| KUB's electric service area covers approximately 200,000 customers in seven surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=388)|
| 0:06:37| From my perspective, and I believe the board agrees with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| our primary objective for us to provide electric service to these customers is in a manner that is safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=400)|
| 0:06:48| reliable, and efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| The first thing I'd like to do is thank the community members who served on the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| And if you all would stand up, I know some of you all are here, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| I think this is roughly about half the panel or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| So their names are listed somewhere probably in somebody's program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=425)|
| 0:07:11| This was very hard work and time consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| It was estimated there were about 83 hours of meetings, discussion, untold hours in between meetings, doing research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=435)|
| 0:07:25| They went on a field trip, drafting narrative, working in small groups to develop recommendations, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=445)|
| 0:07:35| These volunteers, and some of them are here tonight, are to be thanked for their service to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| It's been a very demanding process, and they were a very dedicated group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| The process to select the panel members was based on criteria suggested by city council's resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| as well as additional criteria approved by KUB's board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| It was intended to ensure a broad range of opinions and geographic diversity was represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=477)|
| 0:08:04| The panel represented 15 community members and one KUB representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| who served as an ex-officio member without voting privileges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| In order to achieve geographic diversity, KUB appointed one representative on the panel from each city council district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=493)|
| 0:08:21| and thought there would be value to include several representatives who had been critical of KUB's vegetation management practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=501)|
| 0:08:29| KUB also felt it was important to select a city council member to represent the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=509)|
| 0:08:35| This resulted in selecting ten participants from the group nominated by members of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| and recruiting five participants to ensure diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| In the end, panel members included tree board members, developer, certified arborist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| current and past leaders of neighborhood associations, a representative from KUB's union county service area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=531)|
| 0:08:59| and others with backgrounds and opinions reflecting the diversity of our customer base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| It was critical that we ensure the process was open and inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| We hired an independent facilitator to manage the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| And our role as board members and staff has primarily been to observe and provide support as requested by the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=554)|
| 0:09:23| The panels had free reign to look at all aspects of our program and request any documents they felt were important to their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=563)|
| 0:09:30| The public has been invited to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| Many appeared at panel meetings and provided input throughout, including through an e-mail box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=573)|
| 0:09:41| And also there was a survey instrument also by mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| You have a lot more to hear tonight from the panel members, so I'm going to step aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| I'm going to close one more time by asking you to thank this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| They really did a wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| It was a long taxing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| It was an exercise in group dynamics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| And thankfully we've reached a good list, we hope, of recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=600)|
| 0:10:05| So thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| The next person who's going to help us understand about this process is Jamie Rowe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| and she's going to speak about the education we all received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| Remember, it's like the first day of school in kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| We all came with different degrees of readiness and understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| For my presentation, I actually used notes from the KUB minutes as well as my notes, and I tried to put them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=627)|
| 0:10:36| February 5th, Liz Hannah, the KUB lead forester, outlined KUB's current tree trimming program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| and policies as well as safety issues, electrical reliability, customer notification, and dispute resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=642)|
| 0:10:51| Tom Simpson, the East Tennessee Regional Urban Forester for Tennessee Department of Agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| the forestry division, illustrated national pruning standards for utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=656)|
| 0:11:03| And then these are some of the comments that he had said to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| If a tree has a lot of wounds, such as excessive pruning, then a tree loses a lot of its transporting system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=666)|
| 0:11:14| Every cut is a wound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| Tree wounds may be on the inside and not show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| Trees seal but don't heal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| Pruning creates a wound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| To minimize cuts, you have smaller wounds that have a better chance of sealing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| and bigger cuts are worse for healing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| February 16th, Tom Simpson again shared information on national pruning standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| and utilities with the public and the panel at the public listening session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| March 4th, panel member Larry Silverstein outlined his concerns about KUB's tree trimming program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=705)|
| 0:11:52| and suggested areas for the panel to focus on in its work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| The main issues he thought KUB should stop included ground-to-sky pruning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=716)|
| 0:12:03| and removal of all six-inch diameter trees and other vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| He thinks the objective should be for KUB to cut as little as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| and only when necessary to achieve safety and reliability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| and that KUB should return to the prior, less aggressive pruning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| Regarding trees and power outages, he questioned the claims of KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| For one example, he cited 7,100 power outages from May 2005 to May 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=749)|
| 0:12:37| in which only 271 events were the result of trees in the trim zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=757)|
| 0:12:43| which is about four percent of the outages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| Panel member David Vandegrift, the UT Agricultural Extension agent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| provided a presentation regarding utility tree pruning and the appraised value of trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=771)|
| 0:12:58| He stressed safety and reliability of electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| He said a pruning cut is a wound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| He told us that removal of one-third of the canopy is okay as far as tree health is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| and the best answer may be to cut down the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| He said a lot of trees needed to be removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| and resources should then be put into planting trees in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| March 18, the panel took a field trip to recent tree pruning sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| in North Knox County, Fountain City, and West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| When we returned, Mike Patterson, the KUB manager of system operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| gave handouts to panel members on an evaluation of KUB tree pruning practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| by Dr. Edward Gilman and two reports by Jim Cortese on tree assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| of KUB power line circuits and post-pruning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| Mr. Patterson also provided a breakdown of customer complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| a benchmark study of other utility tree pruning practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| and discussed the cause codes referenced in the customer newsletter and on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=840)|
| 0:14:07| April 8, tree industry contractor Tom Wolfe, who does contract work for KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| fielded questions on crew training, supervision, contracts, and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| He said KUB has a good program, more regimented than most utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| but KUB does not empower the people at the level the work is being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| He thinks KUB could get more done if they allowed more authority at the lower levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| April 22, Dr. Jennifer Franklin, UT professor in the Department of Forestry, Wildlife, and Fisheries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=874)|
| 0:14:44| who teaches tree biology, gave a basic introduction to tree growth and growth response to pruning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=884)|
| 0:14:52| She said any stressed tree, for example a pruned tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| will make it more susceptible to insect attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| In winter, when the tree is dormant, is a better time to prune.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| Do as little as you can in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| In the spring, when leaves first leaf out, is the worst time to prune.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| Also, you shouldn't cut when insects are active, nor if there is a drought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| Cut as little as possible, because the fewer cuts, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| Ground-to-sky pruning causes major stress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| She said only 25 percent of the canopy should be removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| and this is what ANSI regulations, ANSI 300 regulations also say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| She said if you go beyond the 25 percent, the trees will lose roots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| The trees must have enough leaves to support the roots, and if not, the roots die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=941)|
| 0:15:47| Sam Anderson, certified arborist with Cortese Tree Specialists, also answered questions at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=947)|
| 0:15:54| May 6, at the panel's request, KUB Tree Panel member Jennifer Gearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=954)|
| 0:16:00| who was a member of a similar panel in Tallahassee, Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| provided information on her experience with the Tallahassee Tree Panel and its recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| The objectives there included such items as maintaining the tree canopy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| and planting the right tree in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| The utility company only required a five-foot clearance, and the trim cycle was 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| They don't cut overhanging limbs of live oaks that are high enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=984)|
| 0:16:30| not to come in contact with the power lines in wet weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| There is 100 percent pre-planning on private land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| Twenty-five percent of the system used insulated wires to reduce outages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| and they zigzagged their lines crossing the streets in order to avoid trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| The Tallahassee Panel also created a dispute resolution committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| On June 2, Professor Tom Plank from UT College of Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| provided information about property rights and easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| He said an easement was the right of one person to use real estate owned by another person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| You can't exceed the right of the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| Exceeding the right of the easement becomes trespassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| He explained regarding limits of easements that are not specifically spelled out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| that doing whatever is reasonable and necessary would be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| Bill Coley, KUB's legal counsel, presented information on KUB's rights and responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1046)|
| 0:17:34| regarding tree trimming and safety for the operation of the electric system and associated liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1054)|
| 0:17:42| I know this has been enthralling to listen to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| Thank you, Jamie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| As you all heard, a large number of people came to help us learn about not only trees but contracting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1068)|
| 0:17:57| what happens when the person is in the bucket truck with the saw in hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| and the person on the ground is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| So it was truly, I think everyone on the panel will agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| a real education about all aspects of the operation of cutting or pruning trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1089)|
| 0:18:16| The next person who's going to address us from the panel is Scott Romines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| And the process that the panel experienced in reaching the conclusions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1100)|
| 0:18:28| and the recommendations with the reports was fairly structured and fairly tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| So thank you, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| I'm Scott Romines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| I live at 808 Lake Glen Lane in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| Much of what I'm going to tell you you've heard already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| but maybe I can give you a nugget of new information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| In January 2010, at the request of city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| KUB selected 15 members of the community to serve on a tree trim review panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| This panel was assembled from a diverse group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| The list included neighborhood representatives, developers, city tree board representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| a certified arborist, and a current member of city council, among others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| and met for the first time on February the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| Along with this group, senior vice president and COO Bill Elmore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| was selected to represent KUB as an ex-officio member without voting privileges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1155)|
| 0:19:24| To assist the members and ensure the process worked in an orderly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| and organized and timely manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| KUB employed the services of professional facilitator Don Ford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| Ms. Ford helped develop a process to decide the goals of the panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| as well as the methods by which to attain them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| One of the first actions of the panel was to hold a meeting on February 16th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| to hear concerns of the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| At this meeting, the group heard from eight citizens who expressed a range of thoughts and ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1186)|
| 0:19:52| Additionally, the public was invited and given time to address the panel at each meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| An e-mail address was established for the panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| and citizens were encouraged to send their comments to the group at their convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| All e-mails, along with responses, were then shared with the entire panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| In order to help educate us panel members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| the group heard several presentations about various aspects of vegetation management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| from KUB staff as well as others not directly affiliated with KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1217)|
| 0:20:24| The topics ranged from the biology of trees as it relates to their growing and pruning cycles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| proper tree health, legal rights regarding easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| and comments regarding the work performed from a current vegetation management company employed by KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1232)|
| 0:20:39| Following the presentations and a field trip to view several areas where pruning had taken place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| multiple brainstorming sessions were utilized to identify major issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| on which the panel wished to make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| All members were given ample opportunity to make their thoughts and opinions known to the entire group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| These lists of ideas were then separated into four categories, aesthetics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| implementation and preventative actions, customer communication and public education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| dispute resolutions, and contractor and contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| The members were then placed into three work groups to develop specific thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| and suggestions relating to the five topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| As each group finished discussion of a given category, the panel as a whole would then discuss the thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| and after some compromising and rewrites, a vote was taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| and the ideas which received a majority of the votes were then elevated to recommendation status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| This work has resulted in the report before you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| Thank you, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| And Scott's comments are from the preface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| and I think at our leisure we'll have time to really go through that and look at that a little more carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| Jennifer Gearing, as mentioned earlier, worked on a similar project in Tallahassee, Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1314)|
| 0:22:02| so she brought a great deal of experience, including some ideas to do and some things to not do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1322)|
| 0:22:09| and let's don't ever talk about that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| So it was a good experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| Jennifer, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| It's my pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| And I wanted to thank all of you for coming tonight and the respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| by taking the time for you to come and hear what we have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| the respect that demonstrates for all the time and the work that we put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| That's something that I personally very much appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| Brenda had asked me to walk through the introductory remarks that are before each of the four primary components of the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1347)|
| 0:22:35| and those four components are section number one on aesthetics, implementation, and preventative actions, page five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1355)|
| 0:22:43| Section two is customer communications and public education, page eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| Section three is dispute resolution, page 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| And section four is contracts and contractors, page 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| Sounds like we rehearsed that ahead of time, didn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| So implementation and aesthetics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| One of the phrases that you'll see when you read through this report is that a pretty tree is not a healthy tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1382)|
| 0:23:09| and that is a statement that really encapsulates a number of different philosophies that the panel approached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| used when they approached the development of recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| From the perspective of implementation and aesthetics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| that phrase really reflects the fact that we were trying to achieve a balance between tree health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1401)|
| 0:23:28| and maintaining the health and the quality of our urban and suburban and rural tree canopy with the need to prune trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1408)|
| 0:23:35| and the fact that everybody has a slightly different idea about what makes for a pretty tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| And many of you have seen top trees, rounded out trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| Many of you have probably seen the L-shaped trees, what we call the goalpost trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| And we had a lot of discussion on the panel about the benefits of proper tree pruning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1430)|
| 0:23:58| And so the very first recommendation that you'll see under implementation and aesthetics talks about lateral pruning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| And lateral pruning is considered to be the industry standard for the proper way to prune a tree in order to promote a healthy tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1444)|
| 0:24:11| And so that's the very reason why that is our number one recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| is to continue the process of lateral pruning as the way that we prune trees on the KUB system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1454)|
| 0:24:21| Now, one of the primary issues that that leads you to when you're trying to prune a tree to be healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1461)|
| 0:24:28| is that several of our speakers talked about easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| is that the panel acknowledged that using the lateral pruning method to achieve tree health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1472)|
| 0:24:39| may in some cases end up with KUB trimming beyond specified easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| And again, we're all talking about balance, and that was one of those issues we talked about extensively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| is where that right balance is between a property owner's easement, specified or unspecified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| and the need to maintain healthy trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| And so that's the compromise that we came to, is reinforcing the commitment to lateral pruning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| as the proper way to prune trees on the KUB system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| Another issue on the implementation is how much we trim, and this whole idea of clearance zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| And as you read through the document, you'll see that mentioned several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| And the reason I highlight this is this is one of the main changes that we are recommending from the current practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| and that is that we have recommended that KUB maintain overhanging branches over neighborhood lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1521)|
| 0:25:29| You can think of it that way, the electrical lines that run through your neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| that they would then retain the branches that are hanging over those lines and the branches that are under those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| Right now there's more of that vegetation that is removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| so that is a significant change from the current practice that's in this group of recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| And you'll hear mention of ground-to-sky pruning, and that's exactly the same issue that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| The result of that recommendation would be to maintain more tree canopy on the KUB system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1552)|
| 0:25:58| Another of the primary changes in the implementation section is on special status trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| And the recommendation that you can all look through, it's number seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| is to maintain the current special status tree program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| but then also to expand it to allow additional trees to qualify as special status trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| and to expand it to include special status areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| And by that you can think of the UT gardens, the botanical gardens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| those type of areas that we felt really do need some special attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| And the special status tree and area program brings that sort of special attention to those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| The other unique item in the implementation section is pre-planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| And I believe Jamie had mentioned pre-planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| Currently, pre-planning is conducted on about 30% of the KUB system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| And the recommendation included in here is to expand that to the greatest extent possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| with 100% pre-planning being the ultimate goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| And pre-planning is a very effective way for KUB foresters to have a discussion with property owners ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| And in the whole concept of trying to address problems before they become disputes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| before they really become issues, address it through a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| and work it through before it becomes an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| Pre-planning is one of the ways that KUB can achieve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| Moving on to customer communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| Some of our primary goals on customer communication were to make KUB's communications more accessible to the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1637)|
| 0:27:24| And a lot of the information that we reviewed is very detailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| And there's good reason for it to be very detailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| But as a panel, we found that it wasn't necessarily read by everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| And so some of our recommendations that are included in here are ways that we feel the communications could be improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1656)|
| 0:27:44| to make sure that more people actually read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| We all get a lot of mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| And by simplifying and making some of the communications more straightforward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| using a lot more visual communications, graphics, diagrams, that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| the panel felt that that was a good way to ensure that more of these messages were getting through to the customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| so that they could continue to make informed decisions about their trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1681)|
| 0:28:08| Another of the changes on the communication side is to allow customers the option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| when they're having a replacement tree planted, to have that planted in a pre-identified public space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| And you'll see that in your recommendations as well under communications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| that it would be a new change from the current practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| And that is to help address some of our situations where folks have a small property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| and perhaps don't have room to replace the trees on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| But it gives them more options and, you know, helps, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| expand those range of options and opportunities for the customer to choose how they want to address the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1716)|
| 0:28:45| Moving on to dispute resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| Thank you, Brenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| Ultimately, when we reviewed KUB's dispute resolution process, the panel felt that it was pretty strong for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1732)|
| 0:28:59| But there was one fundamental change that we have proposed in the recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| and that is the addition of an ombudsman customer advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| We couldn't decide on the name, so we've included both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| And the whole purpose of this person within KUB will be to help customers who have a dispute to negotiate the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1750)|
| 0:29:19| And as the name says, to be their advocate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| and to make sure that all of the right people within KUB are brought into the discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| and to make sure that they are the single point of contact for the customer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| so that they can always go back to the same person when they're having questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| and as they're working through a concern potentially with KUB, that they always know who they can go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| and that that person confirms that the dispute was resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| and, again, kind of circles back internally and with the customer to make sure that the dispute is resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| and keeps moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| So you'll see that on page 12, and that's one area in particular as council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| that I'd like to call your attention to is to look very closely at that ombudsman customer advocate job description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1800)|
| 0:30:06| and to give that some careful attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| The dispute resolution process in general is also outlined in document C in the end of the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| So you can take a look there as well to see about the panel's recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| on how the dispute resolution process would actually flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| Moving on to contracts and contractors, the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| A lot of the issues that came before us that members of the public brought forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| many of them were issues with contractors, and that's for a very good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| That's because contractors do the vast majority of the pruning on the KUB system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| The guys who are out there in the trucks with the chainsaws are primarily contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| And KUB also uses contractors to do more of their actual forestry work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| They're foresters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| They have a few on site as well as a number of contract foresters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| So it's the pruning crews as well as that professional forestry expertise that they rely on from contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1856)|
| 0:31:04| And those contractors are going to continue to play a significant role in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| Our recommendations don't have anything to say about that because it is a very strong aspect of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| But many of the issues that were brought forward by members of the public were really communication issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| And so many of the recommendations on contracts were how to improve communication between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| and supervision between KUB and the contractors as well as how to improve communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| and the opportunity for landowners to communicate with the cutting crew who's in the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| who's in their front yard, when the pruning is actually happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| So the recommendations under contracts and contractors cover those as well as some recommendations for how KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1900)|
| 0:31:46| can bring some of these contractors in-house for longer periods of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| And you'll see that in here in a number of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| And the benefits of that would be that then we'd build some expertise on the part of the contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| if they know that they have a four- to five-year contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| then you'll have a lot more expertise for those crews to be working on the KUB system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| and to have that familiarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| And that familiarity brings expertise and that brings better quality pruning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| and better quality work on the part of our contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| So, again, I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| And, Brenda, I'll leave it back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| I'd like to call the council's attention to page 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| There is a general recommendation that came from this panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| that a qualified citizens panel reconvene in three years after KUB has a chance to put into effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1950)|
| 0:32:39| and see how this is working, what needs to be tweaked, what is doing just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1959)|
| 0:32:46| And we really felt very strongly about this and had strong conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1966)|
| 0:32:52| And I'd also, being a member of council, like you to pay careful attention to the dispute resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| because, as Jennifer pointed out, there is an ombudsman customer advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| If the dispute cannot be resolved, then it would go to a three-member panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| who has no contractual or experience with KUB other than probably a rate payer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1989)|
| 0:33:17| But they would be some people who have some expertise in trees or some of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| If it still wasn't resolved, then the dispute would go to a professional mediator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| So there are many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| And then if it still didn't work out, it could go to the KUB Board of Commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| And then there's always a judicial outcome if other things don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| So I think that one of the concerns of council, if I remember correctly, was the dispute process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| And this panel took great pains, am I correct, panel members, to be sure that we did address this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2025)|
| 0:33:52| Well, now that we have heard what the panel has recommended, the next question becomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| well, we've given this report to KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| They have a minority report also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| So what are they going to do with all this, put it on the shelf and say thank you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| And they did give us a really nice paperweight, I will have to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| But are they going to put this on the shelf and then that's the end of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| Are they going to reconvene in six months so we can have dinner again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| Or what are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| So Mintha Roach, who is the CEO of KUB, probably can give us some guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| Thank you, Brenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| I'm Mintha Roach, 722 Chia Woods Circle, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| Before I get into what Brenda asked me to cover, I want to say thank you to the council for being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2072)|
| 0:34:38| This is a very important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| We took your resolution very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| And I also want to say thank you to the KUB board for creating this panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| because I think it took some guts to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| And they authorized it, they opened it up, and they, I think, selected a very good, diverse panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2088)|
| 0:34:56| In the back of your reports, in the appendix, you'll see a summary of all of the participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| And I hope you will take the time to read that because all of these people served very, very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| and they have a lot of qualifications and experience they brought to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| I think it will help you appreciate the quality of the report when you look at the talent that is there and who participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2112)|
| 0:35:22| They met 21 times, a total of 83 hours, in official session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2122)|
| 0:35:29| There were many people who did a lot of work outside of that in addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| and I want to thank all the panel members for their commitment to this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| It certainly exceeded my expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| I think it probably exceeded theirs when they said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| And many halfway through probably wished they had not said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| But they hung in there, every single one of them, and I think it's to our community's benefit that they all hung in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2148)|
| 0:35:55| And when you get the time to read this, I think you'll see it's being approached very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| It's very thoughtful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| It's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| And we're in their debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| Now, to what we do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| It was my recommendation today, and the KUB board built consensus around the KUB staff will take this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2167)|
| 0:36:14| We just received it yesterday, actually, so we could print it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| And we will engage in an internal process to review the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| and to come back to the board in 30 days at our October board meeting with our plans for implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| We want to expedite this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| We think it's gone on a long time already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| and we hope that our package won't take nearly as long as the panel did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| Not to criticize the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| I think there is a lot of thought to be done there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| but our obligation is to get on with this and get some improvements implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| So our intention is to come back to the board with staff's response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| We then think that we need more public input, believe it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| We would like to take our response and what we intend to do of these proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| and go back to the community in a larger way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| When we implemented the PACE 10 program, many of you were on council at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| and we had neighborhood meetings, and we spent hours showing people what we were going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| and where construction was going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| and it really helped, I think, introduce people to the new way of doing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| So we would propose that same format, meeting north, south, east, and west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| and inviting the council, the neighborhood associations, KUB, the panel members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2248)|
| 0:37:34| and everyone being there to engage and answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| It would be our design right now, and of course we're a few weeks away from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| to basically provide the majority report, the two minority reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| and then to say what KUB's proposal is so that the people get to see the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| and in particular how KUB intends to respond to each of those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| We then would take that input as well as any input we would get through the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| We will create another Trees at KUB mailbox to get input again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| and then we will report back to the board in November collectively of all the inputs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2288)|
| 0:38:14| and probably what we would propose as our plans to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| That is a very ambitious schedule, but I think we can meet it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| That's why I'm sharing it with you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| If we have a hiccup along the way and it's important for us to be more judicious, we will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| but we want to have this finished and ready to be implemented by the end of November or December at the latest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2312)|
| 0:38:41| Public input continues to be a priority for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| We have posted the majority and two minority reports on our website today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| We will, as we go through this process, put all the documents associated with it on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| We will seek public input through the website, and we will obviously make all that input public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2337)|
| 0:39:04| We thank you again for the opportunity to engage the community in this very important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| Council, are we ready for questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| Are we overwhelmed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| Maybe I'll ask Memphis as she sat down, but when you talk about educating the public and public input and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| how do you plan to go about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| Well, at the North, South, East, West meetings, we will basically have our proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| basically saying what we're going to do about communication or contractor compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| or whatever the issues that came out of the 70-plus recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| Once we decide what we're going to do, then we're going to engage in an enhanced communication program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2381)|
| 0:39:48| One of the recommendations that has been made by the panel is that we seek professional assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2388)|
| 0:39:55| in how to format a program to get out to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| They suggested videos that actually show trimming occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| They suggested illustrations so that when you go into homes, people can better understand what you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2403)|
| 0:40:10| They have suggested public meetings, cable TV, speakers' bureaus, all those sorts of formats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2410)|
| 0:40:18| So we will be developing a plan to be proactive in the communications to the community at large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2418)|
| 0:40:25| and then also improving the communication with the actual homeowner when it's time to trim at their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| The reason I ask is because that sounds like a pretty ambitious task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| With the rate increases and the costs of, you know, energy costs and TVA increases and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2436)|
| 0:40:42| And, by the way, I've said this before, rate payers and taxpayers are one and the same in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2442)|
| 0:40:49| So we hear complaints about things that we really don't have very much control over, if any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2449)|
| 0:40:56| So, I mean, what's the costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| That's an excellent point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| And that was a point that was considered very strongly as the panel made recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2460)|
| 0:41:05| There were some of the recommendations that they thought would be great, but said that would be very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| Today, at today's board meeting, one of the commissioners brought up the issue of cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| And when we report back in October of our plans to move forward, we plan to do so in a format that includes the panel's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2475)|
| 0:41:23| recommendations, KUB's response to that, our timeline and the anticipated cost for that recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2483)|
| 0:41:30| if it's significant, if it can't be absorbed within our regular operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2490)|
| 0:41:37| One other thing, Councilman Palmer, you mentioned towards the back here that you're going to review this after three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2497)|
| 0:41:46| and you spent a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| Not necessarily the same people will come back in three years to review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| It could be some of the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| I'm really wondering how you decided on three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| We thought that was enough time from the time it was implemented to see how it was working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| and any place that it needed to be tweaked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| We thought five years was too long and one year was too short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| So the compromise was three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| By that time, you can usually get a pretty good idea of where this is going and where it isn't going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| And as a coincidence, I don't know that this went into their consideration, but we're on a three- to four-year trim cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| So that would mean we would get through a new trim cycle once this program has been implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| And, Councilman Bailey, I appreciate your comments about ratepayers and taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| because far more than the panel wanted to hear, I did use the term ratepayer because I understood that very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2557)|
| 0:42:45| I don't know who was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| Councilman Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| I just want to say that I want to thank KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| and I want to thank all the panel members that put in all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| I'm thinking that after you folks putting in 82 hours and 21 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| I've had this report for 42 minutes and I'm sure that once we get a chance to review it and look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| we'll have some questions and I appreciate the fact that we'll be able to ask those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| and so will the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| But, again, I just want to say thank you all very much for all the hard work that you put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| I, too, want to thank the members of this panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| and especially Councilmember Palmer for her leadership that she's shown on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2602)|
| 0:43:29| I just had one or two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| And the odds budsman, Ms. Roach, I hate to ask you to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2612)|
| 0:43:39| The odds budsman, would that person be employed by KUB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| It is the recommendation of the panel that KUB add a person on staff, not a contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| but a person on staff to be a customer advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| And, as Jennifer said, there was some discussion about what the title should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| and they never reached consensus on that, so they call it ombudsman slash customer advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2637)|
| 0:44:03| So that will be something that we will take under consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| and then report back to our board in October how we plan to pursue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| I think that person should have a great deal of independence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| The report recommended that that person report directly to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| And I'm curious, during the complaints about the KUB trimming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| was there any one particular section of the city that had more complaints on that than others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| or just pretty much across the board as far as the complaints about the trimming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| I haven't thought of it in that perspective, so I can't really answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| I don't think it was one particular area, but I don't want to commit to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| I can provide you the addresses of those who complained if that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| Okay. Just curious about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| Councilman De La Volpe, Councilwoman Roddy, Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| In that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| I guess I have several questions, but before that, like everyone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| I want to thank you for the service and for KUB for handling the trim panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2704)|
| 0:45:11| and the work that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| I know that this is a controversial area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| and there's always that give-and-take yin-yang that one side needs to trim for safety and reliability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2716)|
| 0:45:23| and the other side, if it's the homeowner group, is concerned about the aesthetics in their yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| and their property and the appearance of their city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| And I know that you all struggle with this, and I attended a few of your meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| and I appreciate the time you put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| It is a great public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| In terms of questions, I have one, and it may be that further study of the report will answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| I noticed there was a category on special trees and special areas and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| and I don't know if someone from KUB wants to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| When you have a situation like the arboretum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| and they went in and cut trees in an area that you would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| well, that would be a really special area that should be treated kind of with kid gloves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| and you even had a presenter from Florida, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| that talked about in some special district they had in Florida that had old-growth trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| They literally zigzagged the lines across the street and avoided those areas as best they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2776)|
| 0:46:24| Obviously, it's impossible to do it all the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| But how did the arboretum kind of overcutting occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| Did you sort of do a post-mortem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| I mean, are we addressing that in the report, for example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2794)|
| 0:46:40| We had a speaker come, Jim McDonough, representing the arboretum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| to complain to the panel about the trim that had recently occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| It is a fact that KUB spoke with the staff at the botanical gardens and arboretum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2810)|
| 0:46:59| and worked out a pruning plan that was executed consistent with what staff had approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2819)|
| 0:47:07| Okay, so they were aware that you were cutting some old-growth trees in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| They were aware of every trim we did and had it approved in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| I don't think everyone on the board might have been aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| In terms of the report or the approach you're looking at in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| is there going to be some effort to avoid special areas like that where maybe you even, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2845)|
| 0:47:32| move the lines in the interest of community protection of something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| One of the recommendations in the report is that we expand the special tree status program to include areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| and it was discussed that that would be one of those areas that could be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| And it also, though, includes in there that that would be in conjunction with the costs being shared by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| or consideration to the cost to the customer as well as KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| So that is an aspect that we will look at enhancing and including areas, not just trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2879)|
| 0:48:05| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| Councilwoman Palmer, I guess maybe this is for you since you're chairing this panel here today, the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2888)|
| 0:48:16| There's a minority report here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| Are we going to hear something about it and its purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| And is someone going to speak about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| That will be part of the public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| After we complete the main session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2908)|
| 0:48:36| I'll defer to Ms. Roddy for now, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| This question is for Ms. Roach, and it's a pretty simple one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| I just wanted to emphasize or underscore what I heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| and that is if we hear from citizens who would like to read the report or have input, concerns, feedback about the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2927)|
| 0:48:54| they can go to the KUB website and read the full report there as well as the minority reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| In fact, I would prefer if you would encourage people to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| Don't wait to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| Encourage people to take the time to go there and read it, and there will be a way that they can reply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| There's trees at KUB.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| And that was my next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| Will there be like a button, an easy button?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| There's an e-mail right now, trees at KUB.org, but if you scan through it, there's also a link where the people can reply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2955)|
| 0:49:22| But we have an e-mail set up, trees at KUB.org, that goes immediately into our vegetation management area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2962)|
| 0:49:28| as well as we're going to use it for responding to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| And is that e-mail address, trees at KUB.org, is that visible on the home page that you first come to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| or do you need to link to find it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| You have to go to the tree trim panel, I think, tree trim policy review panel, and then it goes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| The tree trim policy review panel is easy to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| Yes, that's on the front page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| Great, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| I also wanted to congratulate the panel for the hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| It looks like you had a good selection of people, and I do think it was courageous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=2997)|
| 0:50:03| and wise to include people who, out of the gate, were perceived as critical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| and I think it's good to include them in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| I also want to thank Dawn Ford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| Is she here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| Who was the facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| I kind of wish that she was here because I'd love to hear what her thoughts were about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3022)|
| 0:50:29| I mean, I see smiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| What is that about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| I think that Dawn is very relieved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| I will share something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| She had a long planned trip this week, part of last week and this week, to a really nice vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3040)|
| 0:50:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| Because, like the rest of us, she did not think we would be this long doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| It's usually the facilitator that does a lot of the hard work and doesn't get recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| Putting our ideas together and keeping us focused was a real task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| I'm probably sure that she has put a block on the KUV call number or call to her cell phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3061)|
| 0:51:08| Well, anyway, look, it sounds like it was a great process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| I mean, what I can tell, it was a process of education and brainstorming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| and then making recommendations, something along that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| And so all of the questions, you were right, it was good to wait until the end because all my questions were answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3084)|
| 0:51:34| Oh, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| What I heard from you, Mintha, is that these recommendations are ultimately going to arrive at the table of the Board of Commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3095)|
| 0:51:46| and they will either agree or change or amend what they hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3106)|
| 0:51:53| And maybe it's unfair, I can't really ask you this question, but I'm thinking of asking you this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| Just go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| Do you feel good about, broadly speaking, the recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| I can speak for myself only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| I cannot speak for the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| But I participated in all the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| I was there except for one when I was out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| And I had, Bill Elmore was at every meeting and we had numerous staff people at every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3136)|
| 0:52:22| So we heard the dialogue as it was going along and we think there are many, many positive things that we can implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| Yeah, one of Ms. Roddy's questions triggered a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| Is there any process in place where after the public comments come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3157)|
| 0:52:46| or are coming in through the website that somehow the panel will see them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| Or is the panel just 100% done at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| Oh, no, we're not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| We thought we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| In fact, MENFA today suggested that it would be very good for the panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| and the council members when they do these geographical meetings that we come in to answer questions, observe, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3181)|
| 0:53:11| So I'm afraid this will probably plague us the rest of our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| But other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| Well, you have a career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| You're an honorary forester, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| I guess so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| I thought they were going to apply for pension benefits, but they didn't listen to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| Okay, back to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| Yes, the panel will get the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| We can access the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| I think there are a couple of other processes for us to get things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| I know that Mr. Burr sent an e-mail today to city council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| and I will be forwarding that on to the Tree Trim panel tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| Well, one of the reasons I ask that is through this process you guys have become sort of lay experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3227)|
| 0:53:53| You're not trained foresters, you're not arborists, but you have listened to a whole lot of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3233)|
| 0:53:59| and some of the public comments will be things that you feel like, well, we've really dealt with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| and struggled with it and come up with a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| And some might be new, and I just don't know how you'll react as you see those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| whether you'll have an opportunity to comment or take a second look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| I personally do not envision this panel getting back together to have any kind of a review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3254)|
| 0:54:20| but I can't speak for the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| Obviously, if there's a great will, I'm sure that we'll all look forward to the box lunch again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3262)|
| 0:54:29| preferably the pizza from Tomato Head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| But, I mean, we've been together, we've done this, and I think that am I speaking for all of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3271)|
| 0:54:37| that we think we've given it our best shot, but we'll be happy to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| Above and beyond, probably, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| I don't know about that, but we are certainly happy to answer questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| and our e-mail addresses, am I correct, are still on the website, or the tree panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3287)|
| 0:54:53| and if it goes to the tree panel, it will get to us, and then we can respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| You'll get those e-mails that shoot out to your group so that you can comment individually if nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| One other question, and I know that the panel obviously struggled with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3303)|
| 0:55:09| and KUB struggles with this, and the citizens struggle with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| is there's at times a disconnect between the explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3312)|
| 0:55:19| and hoped-for result that's going to happen in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| and when you turn a truck and a chainsaw over to a crew and they're out doing their thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| and, you know, they're making progress in the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| and they may or may not have the same level of sensitivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| and I see several recommendations that deal with training and with crew chief and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| Do you feel like you're bringing kind of the theory of what we need to do together with the actual practice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3339)|
| 0:55:46| Because that part is the hardest piece to solve, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| Well, I think, speaking for the panel, that was one of the hardest things we had to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| was how to make sure that the person with the chainsaw in the bucket was doing what needed to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3354)|
| 0:56:01| and so we really focused on communication at all levels, whether it was with the customer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| whether it was with the contractors, whether it was with the crew or the contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| and we built in some very specific recommendations about the training based on those very concerns that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3370)|
| 0:56:18| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| And I think when you read them, they're fairly explicit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| Yeah, I've been reading them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| I think one of the issues that came before the panel was we didn't want to micromanage how KUB did things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3385)|
| 0:56:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| But at the same time, we had some really strong feelings about some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| So I hope we achieved a balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| I guess we'll know in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| How many speakers do we have signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| Ms. Wilson is about to bring that list over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| The envelope, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| While she's doing that, I'll remind you that you do have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| We do have a timer at the end of four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| I'll just quietly remind you that you have one minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| There's no hook or anything, though, that comes and pulls you out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| We have four speakers, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| And the first one is Duane Burke, who was a three-panel member from Union County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3434)|
| 0:57:21| While Duane is coming, a reminder that we look at this from the city of Knoxville perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| KUB has to look at this as standards that apply in the eight-county area to all 200,000 customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3446)|
| 0:57:33| So what might work really well in one neighborhood might not be as realistic in another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3453)|
| 0:57:39| So part of KUB's response will be tempered to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| Duane, if you'll give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| My name is Duane Burke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| The fiscal address of my residence is 200 Karen Lane, Maynardville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3468)|
| 0:57:55| Councilwoman Palmer, members of city council, and others, thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3475)|
| 0:58:01| And I will try to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| I am a member of the 15-member KUB tree trim policy review panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3484)|
| 0:58:10| which has been reviewing the KUB tree pruning policies during the last seven and one-half months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3490)|
| 0:58:18| I became a member as a result of receiving information about the formation of the panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3498)|
| 0:58:24| which was provided by KUB in one of my monthly utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3504)|
| 0:58:31| Along with that information was an application to be considered as a panel member if interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3511)|
| 0:58:38| I completed the application and mailed it back to KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| And about a month later I received a response from KUB inviting me to serve, which I accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3522)|
| 0:58:50| My interest in serving was to make sure that the rural counties, that my own county, that my neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3530)|
| 0:58:58| and that rural perspectives were represented on the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| KUB's service area is much broader than Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3544)|
| 0:59:10| KUB provides service in portions of seven counties other than Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| And I guess you can say that I represented views from other parts of the KUB service area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3555)|
| 0:59:22| I was primarily interested in KUB providing safe and reliable electric service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3562)|
| 0:59:29| to properly care for the trees and preserve their healthy regrowth whenever possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3569)|
| 0:59:34| while being sensitive to customer aesthetic and preservation concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3574)|
| 0:59:40| and also to keep utility rates as low as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| And that is especially important with the current state of the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| Representing the views of the other seven counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| I was particularly interested in ensuring that all customers are treated equitably in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3592)|
| 1:00:01| And also definitely after the new policies are implemented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| that there is equality among all customers built into this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| My views of KUB were positive prior to beginning this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3611)|
| 1:00:18| based on my prior experience at my residence in the area of tree pruning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3618)|
| 1:00:25| They also still remain very favorable and positive upon completing the work of the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3625)|
| 1:00:32| I believe, and I've had a good perspective on which to base this belief during the past seven and a half months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3632)|
| 1:00:40| it is my belief that the Knoxville Utilities Board is a strong organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| and is based upon, from my perspective, the principle of total quality management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| with good leadership at the CEO and senior management levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| And I feel that the KUB Board of Commissioners will give due diligence to this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3656)|
| 1:01:03| to our recommendations, and that they will ultimately make policy changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| that are reasonable and necessary to better serve their customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3668)|
| 1:01:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| Thank you, Duane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| Our next speaker is Larry Silverstein, who is also a member of the panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| and who has a minority report that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| My name is Larry Silverstein, 7808 Sheffield Drive, Knoxville 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| First, I'm here to thank City Council for its continued interest in this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| This is the third time that I have appeared before this body on this matter of great concern to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3699)|
| 1:01:46| On December 1, 2009, City Council adopted a resolution sponsored by former Councilman Rob Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3706)|
| 1:01:53| The resolution, as originally proposed, encouraged KUB to set up an independent appeals board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3713)|
| 1:02:00| to help with dispute resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| At KUB's request, City Council amended that resolution to further encourage KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3723)|
| 1:02:09| to set up an independent tree trim policy review panel to look at the entire KUB vegetation management program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3729)|
| 1:02:18| The resolution suggested that this panel, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| will be charged with performing a comprehensive review of KUB's vegetation management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| parentheses, tree trimming program, including its impact on the safety and reliability of the electric system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3748)|
| 1:02:35| tree trimming methods and standards, customer communications, contractor management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3755)|
| 1:02:41| conflict resolution procedures, and the impacts on tree health and neighborhood aesthetics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3761)|
| 1:02:48| Since February 5th of 2010 and through 21 meetings, which averaged four hours in length,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3768)|
| 1:02:56| this panel has worked hard to review KUB's entire vegetation management program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3776)|
| 1:03:02| After much debate, we have approved over 70 recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| There is also a minority report, which I co-wrote, with an additional 26 recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3787)|
| 1:03:13| many of which were defeated by one or two votes by the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| The completion of the panel's work is an important event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| and I know that you will give careful consideration to our entire report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| I would be happy to discuss this report with any members of council at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3808)|
| 1:03:33| At the present time, City Council is not being asked to take any official action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3813)|
| 1:03:39| We must wait and see KUB's board's response and then see if policies are changed and then implemented in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3819)|
| 1:03:49| If KUB does not make the changes to policies which are necessary to stop using the practice of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3829)|
| 1:03:57| quote, ground the sky pruning, end quote, and to stop removing hundreds of thousands of small diameter trees per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3837)|
| 1:04:06| regardless of their height or proximity to power lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| then I and many others will be urging City Council to consider additional actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3850)|
| 1:04:16| to force KUB to do the right thing for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| I appreciate very much your active engagement on this issue as well as the work of your predecessors on City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3860)|
| 1:04:28| I look forward to a resolution of this issue in the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| which will meet KUB's objectives as well as the community's objectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3872)|
| 1:04:38| and which will respect the legal rights of property owners. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| Thank you, Larry. Our next speaker is Terry Faulkner, and I believe that Terry is a neighborhood leader in the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3883)|
| 1:04:50| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| There are those who might disagree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| Well, she lives in the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| Yes, I do. And I'm speaking just as an individual right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3898)|
| 1:05:04| And it's Terry Faulkner, 4178 Ridgeway Lane, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| And over the last seven years I've been a City Tree Board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3910)|
| 1:05:16| I'm a member of the KUB PACE Board, I believe, for five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| and have worked with City Council funding, with TDOT funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3921)|
| 1:05:28| with the City Department of Public Affairs, David Brace, Bob Wetzel in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3928)|
| 1:05:36| and the City Arborist, Jeff McCarter, in working to add trees along the Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3936)|
| 1:05:43| and along streets and roads in the Bearden community all the way from Bearden to Middlebrook to Western into 17th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3943)|
| 1:05:52| to create a coordinated tree design for a corridor into the city, a major corridor into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3952)|
| 1:06:01| And in doing that, I've usually been there during the installation of the trees or during part of the install time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3961)|
| 1:06:12| And I've seen the dirt into which these trees go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| And they're usually an inch and a half to two inch in caliber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| And it's usually horrible dirt, construction dirt, red clay and gravel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| So consequently, and the city waters these trees for a year and gets them established, but after that they're on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3987)|
| 1:06:35| And many of them don't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| We have a good survival rate, but a lot of them don't make it because they're nursery trees installed into a natural, horrible situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=3997)|
| 1:06:48| So what I'm asking is that because the panel, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4008)|
| 1:06:56| failed to endorse a recommendation to have KUB not clear cut trees under power lines that are six inches and above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4016)|
| 1:07:12| we need to look at keeping native trees that are smaller, four inches, three inches diameter, but definitely six inches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4032)|
| 1:07:22| in place that have grown from a seed in terrible conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| We need to look at keeping those trees and sorting them out, tagging them, preserving them, because they're going to be long-lived trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4047)|
| 1:07:36| And I would encourage city council to make that recommendation as a part of the total recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4056)|
| 1:07:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| The last speaker who has signed up is David Vandergriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| And David was also a member of the KUB tree panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4070)|
| 1:07:58| David Vandergriff, 4005 Cletus Way, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| I'm not dressed quite the same as my fellow panel members, but I am an agricultural extension agent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4083)|
| 1:08:09| and I've been in the field all day with turfgrass professionals that are turfgrass field days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4089)|
| 1:08:14| So I apologize for not being dressed quite as nicely as the other panel members, but I had to do my day job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4094)|
| 1:08:27| I am the certified arborist that's on the panel, and I am a trained arborist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4107)|
| 1:08:36| One of the things that we heard throughout our process was the need for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4116)|
| 1:08:43| And another thing that we heard throughout the process was the strong commitment for trees in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4123)|
| 1:08:54| Gene Burr, who's here from scenic Knoxville, urged us to consider the valuable asset that trees are to our city, and they certainly are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4134)|
| 1:09:08| But while trees are on the forefront with this issue, I would like to urge city council to keep them on the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4148)|
| 1:09:16| The trees that are in utility right-of-ways are really a small number of trees in our total urban forestry canopy of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4156)|
| 1:09:26| And we are soon will be embarking on a tree inventory, which will be a valuable management tool for our city to make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4166)|
| 1:09:38| But the trees outside of the KUB easements need protection, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4178)|
| 1:09:45| And we spend a lot of time talking about whether pruning practices were proper or improper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4185)|
| 1:09:51| whenever it's being done by the utility, but the most detrimental things to trees as a whole is tree topping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4191)|
| 1:09:59| which is done every day, unfortunately, in our community, all throughout our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| So I hope that you all, while you're thinking about trees, will consider not only the utility issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4205)|
| 1:10:11| but that we need to consider trees as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4211)|
| 1:10:15| We need more education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| And I would strongly urge you to consider enacting an ordinance to prohibit tree topping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4217)|
| 1:10:23| and eliminate the very unprofessional folks that are out here preying on innocent people and improperly pruning their trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4223)|
| 1:10:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| Thank you, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| Council members, Mr. Delamope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| Before David leaves, David, would you finish the thought you were just presenting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| What would you have us do to curb the tree topping issue that you talked about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4245)|
| 1:10:53| Is that a matter of licensing of cutters, training, public information, fines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4253)|
| 1:10:59| What is it you're saying we should be doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| There are several ways it could be gone about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| A couple of years ago, I gave a talk to landscape professionals at our winter short course that we do with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4263)|
| 1:11:10| And the title of my talk then was certification, licensing, and insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| because a lot of people are told things whenever they hire services done that simply aren't true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4275)|
| 1:11:22| In preparing, and this had been a couple of years ago, in preparing to give that talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4282)|
| 1:11:29| I looked in the yellow pages in the Knoxville phone book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| There were about 70 companies that advertised tree services of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4293)|
| 1:11:39| Twenty-four of them advertised tree topping directly in their ads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| Some people just put flyers by your mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| All sorts of ways people get information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| And, unfortunately, a lot of people in the general public, I can tell you as an extension agent that talks to people every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4310)|
| 1:11:58| they're very tree illiterate, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| And that's why education is so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| We have less than a half a dozen companies that have certified arborists employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4325)|
| 1:12:12| And that's really sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| So, you know, there are several things that could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| You could have an ordinance that prohibited tree topping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4338)|
| 1:12:21| and then if it had enforcement power where that person that did that practice was fined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4341)|
| 1:12:27| then certainly that would help to eliminate some of these people preying on people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4347)|
| 1:12:33| and destroying their trees because that's exactly what it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| You could perhaps do licensing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| That's a much more complicated process, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| But right now we have no prohibitions about people improperly pruning trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| And we've not put enough resources into educating the public about proper tree care practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4370)|
| 1:12:57| Now, certainly our recommendations from the panel, there's a lot of those that deal with the increased education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4377)|
| 1:13:05| But I hope you all as city council will stand behind that, regardless of the KUB issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4385)|
| 1:13:12| but look at it as the terrible abuse that's done to our trees throughout the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4392)|
| 1:13:19| and how that could be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| I'd just like to add one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| When we have been looking at the tree pruning process, we always, KUB gets accused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4408)|
| 1:13:34| whether they've been down your street or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| And it might be TVA who came down your street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| It might be AT&T or it might be Comcast or Nology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| So I live off Middlebrook Pike, and there was a section that KUB came through to prune,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4425)|
| 1:13:52| and they were very judicious in how they did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| And then about a week later, somebody came through and bush-hogged right down the roadway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4435)|
| 1:14:01| And now that looks really ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| So I think that one thing that all of us need to be aware is to be sure which utility company is actually doing the pruning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4443)|
| 1:14:12| And I know Lenore City prunes in a part of West Knox County near the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| and it isn't a pretty sight after they've come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| So any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| I'd like us to ask Mr. Silberstein a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| I was looking at the recommendations that apparently were not included in the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4468)|
| 1:14:34| and it had to do with factoring in the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| It's number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| I'm not sure this is the page number, but it's A3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| And it talks about looking at the time of year and seasonal conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| And we had another speaker talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| I think Jennifer spoke about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| And it said that the trees should not be cut or limited cutting should occur when they're under stress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| whether that's drought periods or early spring leaf out or a time when the summer insects perhaps are virulent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4497)|
| 1:15:06| Why is that not in the main report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| In other words, that sounded like something that several panel members spoke about, but it's a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| Larry, do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| The short answer is that it's addressed somewhat in the main report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4520)|
| 1:15:26| I added it with a little more detail in the minority report to explain what we heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4526)|
| 1:15:34| I mean, frankly, what we heard from Dr. Franklin specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| And one of the things I had suggested was that, you know, maybe KB should not use a 12-month-a-year pruning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4538)|
| 1:15:48| that there may be certain months like, I don't even know exactly when, but March or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| when the leaves are really coming out, that maybe would be a time that if they have to have crews under contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4553)|
| 1:16:00| that those crews could be doing something else like removing trees, but not necessarily pruning trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4560)|
| 1:16:06| Or maybe they could be doing more work with more crews in the wintertime when they're dormant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4566)|
| 1:16:12| And certain species, they say, should not cut at certain times of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4572)|
| 1:16:17| Right now, there's just nothing being done about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| And so I think we approved, I don't have it in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| a rather general recommendation that KUB should at least consider some of these issues and look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4584)|
| 1:16:32| But we didn't have a lot of specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| And this is one of those differences between me and several members of the panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| where I thought it was more important to have a little more information in our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4600)|
| 1:16:47| And others said, well, let's not try to micromanage and do too much of telling KUB what to do or how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4607)|
| 1:16:55| But the explanation that you were suggesting be added is the arborist wisdom that there's a time to prune and a time not to prune,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4615)|
| 1:17:03| and you're saying that should be embodied in at least a working philosophy of how you attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4623)|
| 1:17:10| And right now, the best I can tell, it's not being considered very much by KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| We were told a lot about, specifically with drought situations, some summers where we've had almost no rain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| and that's not good for trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| And so when there's a terrible drought is maybe a time that you shouldn't be cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4644)|
| 1:17:30| Now, that's kind of hard to predict, and you've got crews that are under contract to do work in a specified amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4650)|
| 1:17:37| So I understand there could be some issues in how would you deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| I think, like I said, what the panel came up with was a rather general recommendation that KUB should look at these issues more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4661)|
| 1:17:50| than maybe they have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| So that's the philosophical difference between the main panel and the dissenter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| So my recommendation was just a little more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| Fleshed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| A little more fleshed out, and some of the panel members thought that it should be less so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| Larry, before you go, did we not also discuss Councilman Bailey's point about the cost of this when you have contract crews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4688)|
| 1:18:17| that are doing nothing for a period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| I think that was one of the factors that came into this, if I remember the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| We talked about would it be feasible to do something with a schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| but you could find ways of saying, all right, nobody's going to be working in the month of March or something when the leaves are coming out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4709)|
| 1:18:36| or if there's really a high drought season that crews could be working on other things like tree removals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4716)|
| 1:18:43| There are a certain amount of trees, like whole dead trees that have to come down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| and perhaps there could be some flexibility with moving crews around doing those kinds of activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4726)|
| 1:18:52| but maybe not doing pruning work or at least severe pruning work during seasons of real strict times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4732)|
| 1:18:59| Not so seasons, but times of real stress, which is the early spring leaf out and particularly in the drought times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4739)|
| 1:19:07| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4747)|
| 1:19:08| Any more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| Thank you, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4750)|
| 1:19:11| Councilman Palmer, appreciate you keeping the Council communicating with us on the whole process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4751)|
| 1:19:17| and as Councilman Roddy knows, with the James White Parkway Task Force and the Residential Traffic Calming Committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4757)|
| 1:19:25| this process almost begins to be like a way of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| And so I just want to thank the whole panel and everyone here tonight for their participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4769)|
| 1:19:35| and recognize David Brace was here earlier and Stephen King from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4775)|
| 1:19:41| And just knowing this is going to be an ongoing process, and I believe because of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4781)|
| 1:19:48| our citizens and KUB working together, we are going to have a better end product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| So I just want to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| I wasn't able to get here promptly on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| I'm preparing for Cortland Blount County tomorrow morning, so I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| Rob Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4805)|
| 1:20:06| Council, do we want to hear from him or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| Oh, gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| I couldn't resist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4814)|
| 1:20:15| 4752 Calumet Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| It's good to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| And, you know, a lot of folks or some of the folks on the board, some that I agree with some of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4820)|
| 1:20:26| some that I don't agree with all of the time, invited me to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| particularly since I was one of the folks here at the beginning for this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4830)|
| 1:20:35| Honestly, never did I imagine when this began back in late November, early December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4835)|
| 1:20:42| that here we are in the middle of September and all the amount of time, effort, care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4842)|
| 1:20:49| and compassion that has gone into this and getting it to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| Now, granted, I haven't had the opportunity to read the report since it just came out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| but no matter what's contained in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| people should be given the appropriate amount of appreciation for volunteering to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4861)|
| 1:21:09| In many regards, KUB does things very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4869)|
| 1:21:13| But in some circumstances, and as it applies in tree circumstances, when they make a mistake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4873)|
| 1:21:20| it's a mistake that lasts for decades, if not generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| Probably everyone that I served with recalls the situation with Mrs. Gladys Kirchner out in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4883)|
| 1:21:32| Wrong tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| It was cut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| I mean, KUB, give them credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| They tried to appease Mrs. Kirchner as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| But the mistake that was made is one that's going to last for generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4902)|
| 1:21:47| It's an old growth tree that had been there forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| As everybody knows, trees don't grow overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| KUB compensated Mrs. Kirchner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| But the compensation really comes from, as Councilwoman Palmer pointed out very correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| rate payers are the same as taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| So we paid for a mistake that shouldn't have happened and that Mrs. Kirchner tried to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4924)|
| 1:22:12| I do want to thank KUB for addressing that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| But in my experience on Council, it is fair to say that you hear about zoning decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4935)|
| 1:22:23| Zoning decisions come and go, and they're limited, generally speaking, to certain sectors of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4943)|
| 1:22:29| The vote happens, and it calms down, and in some circumstances goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| This situation with the tree cutting is something that was a constant, or at least a constant for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4954)|
| 1:22:45| It was something that came from different parts of the city on a regular basis as the KUB crews went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4965)|
| 1:22:54| You know, I would get, just like many of you all did get at the time and would get now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| pictures of the unfortunate trimming that has been done right around power lines where the L's or the V's are cut out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4980)|
| 1:23:09| KUB, you know, they recognize that that doesn't look good, but they believe in their heart of hearts that that's a good method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4989)|
| 1:23:19| But I look forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| I know this isn't the end of a conversation, that folks on Council and folks in the community are going to take the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5001)|
| 1:23:29| to look at this and give some time to let it sink in and see how it could be implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5009)|
| 1:23:38| and the review of it, how it could potentially be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5018)|
| 1:23:44| Just in conclusion, I'd like to thank KUB, but in particular those folks who volunteered for this duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5024)|
| 1:23:51| to do something that applies on a citywide basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| Another panel member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5038)|
| 1:23:59| This is very short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| Jim Blenner, 3819 Glenfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| It's Councilwoman Palmer and David Vandegrift both alluded to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| but I wanted to make sure that you got it and that you were aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| But there were three recommendations that the panel made for government entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5052)|
| 1:24:18| and those should have been included to you in a letter that you got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| One of them was talking about the coordination of KUB, the cable companies and AT&T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5062)|
| 1:24:31| One was about the topping, and I can't remember the third one, but they should be included in the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| And if you did not get that and if it was not included in the letter, then we need to make sure that you get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| I just want to make sure that you knew that it was there and it was not ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| I will not let that go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| I think that the report is so hot off the press that we didn't get the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| We don't have the letter yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| We don't have the letter yet, but I'm sure we will have the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| And I will not let us forget what those three things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| And, Councilwoman Dellavopia, I'm counting on you to make sure that I don't forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| Did Ms. Faulkner want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| She walked up to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5111)|
| 1:25:18| Thank you for giving me an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| I hope that everyone understands that when I talk about saving the larger native trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| that I'm not talking about saving ones that are going to grow into the power lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| but things like dogwoods and redbuds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| Those types of things should be saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5135)|
| 1:25:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5137)|
| 1:25:38| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| Going once, going twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5139)|
| 1:25:40| Shall we adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| Thank you all for coming tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5142)|
| 1:26:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5160)|
| 1:26:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100916?start=5162)|
