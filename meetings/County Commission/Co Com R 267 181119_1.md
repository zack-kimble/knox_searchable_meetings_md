| 2:21:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8460)|
| 2:21:01| By a vote of 13 to zero on the consent, the Metropolitan Planning Commission recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8461)|
| 2:21:05| that the property, the rear portion of the property be rezoned CA general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8465)|
| 2:21:12| The CA zoning would be compatible with the adjacent zoning and would enable land uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8472)|
| 2:21:17| that would not be detrimental to the surrounding residential land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8477)|
| 2:21:21| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8481)|

| 2:21:30| Again, I would like to point out that we do have representatives from the Westland Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8490)|
| 2:21:31| Corridor in attendance this evening in support of this project, and I'd like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8491)|
| 2:21:32| that we approve the MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8492)|
| 2:21:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8493)|
| 2:21:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8494)|
| 2:21:35| There's a motion for approval by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8495)|
| 2:21:36| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8496)|
| 2:21:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8497)|

| 2:21:55| Second by Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8515)|
| 2:21:56| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8516)|
| 2:21:57| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8517)|

| 2:22:17| Grove Pike, west of Midway Road, Commission District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8537)|
| 2:22:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8540)|

| 2:22:25| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, 37902. I am here on behalf of KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8545)|
| 2:22:33| Very good. Thank you. All right. Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8553)|
| 2:22:36| Thank you. By a vote of 13 to 0 in the consent agenda, the Metropolitan Planning Commission recommended that the sector plan for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8556)|
| 2:22:43| East County sector be amended for this property to BP Business Park Type 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8563)|
| 2:22:49| That would be an extension of the existing business park designation at the Midway Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8569)|
| 2:22:55| Very good. Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8575)|
| 2:22:59| Okay. The chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8579)|
| 2:23:04| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| Okay. I heard that motion. I'll go ahead from both Commissioner Anders and Commissioner Gill at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8586)|
| 2:23:11| So I think the motion is from Commissioner Anders and the second by Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8591)|
| 2:23:16| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8596)|
| 2:23:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8600)|
| 2:23:21| Okay. Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8601)|
| 2:23:22| Is there a representative from Knoxville Utilities Board here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8602)|
| 2:23:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8606)|

| 2:23:41| Mr. Medford, I'd like you to go line by line the whole document that we're going to be voting on here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8621)|
| 2:23:47| Whereas in the beginning of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8627)|
| 2:23:52| Ed, the reason I did that is Ed is one of the most hardworking employees of Knoxville Utilities Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8632)|
| 2:23:59| And I have an opportunity to serve on a committee with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8639)|
| 2:24:03| And so we're very fortunate to have people of his caliber serving the citizens of not only Knoxville but Knox County as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8643)|
| 2:24:11| So I was just obviously doing this in jest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8651)|
| 2:24:14| But I do appreciate your efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8654)|
| 2:24:17| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8657)|
| 2:24:18| Yes, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| I want to recognize another hardworking person from KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8660)|
| 2:24:25| Michelle, would you raise your hand back here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8665)|
| 2:24:28| And she's from the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8668)|
| 2:24:30| And she's one of the hardest working ones out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8670)|
| 2:24:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8674)|
| 2:24:35| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8675)|
| 2:24:36| I don't want to recognize anybody, but I guess it's a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| We have a ribbon cutting tomorrow at midway, 1030.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8678)|
| 2:24:42| So hopefully we'll see everybody at midway tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8682)|
| 2:24:45| The chair does acknowledge that this morning he turned the lights on in his house and the power came on quite nicely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8685)|
| 2:24:52| and would like to formally thank our friends at KUB for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8692)|
| 2:24:55| So, okay, this motion, I believe it's lost track, is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8695)|

| 2:25:45| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8745)|
| 2:25:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8746)|
| 2:25:47| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8747)|
| 2:25:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8748)|
| 2:25:49| First of all, I would like to note that based on the amount of time I've seen Mr. Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8749)|
| 2:25:52| he must be one of the hardest working attorneys in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8752)|
| 2:25:56| So just keep the thanks going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8756)|
| 2:25:59| He did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8759)|
| 2:26:00| He came straight from the hospital last week to be with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8760)|
| 2:26:02| I'm glad to see he's doing better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8762)|
| 2:26:04| But the Metropolitan Planning Commission on this recommended 13-0 on the consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8764)|
| 2:26:09| that the zoning be designated EC Employment Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8769)|
| 2:26:13| felt this zoning was compatible with the zoning of the Midway Business Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8773)|
| 2:26:17| and would allow public review of the development plan prior to initiation of any development of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8777)|
| 2:26:24| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8784)|
| 2:26:25| Is there any opposition to this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8787)|
| 2:26:28| Seeing none, the chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8788)|
| 2:26:30| Motion to approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8790)|
| 2:26:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8792)|
| 2:26:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8793)|
| 2:26:34| Proper motion has been made by Commissioner Gill with a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8794)|
| 2:26:37| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8801)|

| 2:26:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8808)|
| 2:26:49| We do have one item that was at the beginning of the agenda that we need to get to that we moved to the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8809)|
| 2:26:55| We've got that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8815)|

| 2:27:03| Go ahead, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8823)|

| 2:27:48| Second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8868)|
| 2:27:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8872)|
| 2:27:53| That was the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8873)|
| 2:27:54| It came to us with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8874)|
| 2:27:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8877)|
| 2:27:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8878)|
| 2:27:59| Go ahead, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8879)|
| 2:28:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8880)|
| 2:28:01| This is an ordinance amendment that would establish standards for indoor self-service storage facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8881)|
| 2:28:07| The current county zoning ordinance does not have standards for those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8887)|
| 2:28:12| and we've been band-aiding it by trying to apply the standards for outdoor facilities, which require a larger lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8892)|
| 2:28:19| We also combined all the storage facilities, self-service storage facility standards in one section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8899)|
| 2:28:25| to make it easier for the developers to find those standards and for staff to administer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8905)|
| 2:28:33| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8913)|
| 2:28:34| And the planning commission did recommend unanimously on consent to adopt, to recommend adoption of the ordinance amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8914)|
| 2:28:41| I will check to see if there's any opposition to this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8921)|
| 2:28:43| Is there any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8923)|
| 2:28:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8925)|
| 2:28:46| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8926)|
| 2:28:47| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8927)|
| 2:28:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8929)|
| 2:28:50| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8930)|
| 2:28:51| I want to commend Mr. Green for taking this action so quickly to amend an ordinance that was lacking in some of the newer facilities out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8931)|
| 2:29:00| And, again, I want to thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8940)|
| 2:29:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8942)|
| 2:29:03| Thank you for bringing it to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8943)|
| 2:29:04| We appreciate when the commission does bring us comments from the public that we can address quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8944)|
| 2:29:11| We like being able to take action and do something positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8951)|
| 2:29:15| I want to make a motion now that we accept this amendment and add it to the zoning ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8955)|
| 2:29:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8963)|
| 2:29:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8964)|
| 2:29:25| We have a proper motion by Commissioner Bussler and a second by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8965)|
| 2:29:28| This is an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8968)|
| 2:29:30| So, as a reminder, ordinances require a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8970)|
| 2:29:34| So I'm going to ask the clerk to call on the next person in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8974)|
| 2:29:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8979)|
| 2:29:40| We will be starting with Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=8980)|

| 2:30:39| Point of privilege there, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9039)|
| 2:30:43| I texted Josh and he's on Henley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9043)|
| 2:30:46| If we could give him a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9046)|
| 2:30:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9048)|
| 2:30:49| I mean, it's up to you guys, but he'll be here in just a few minutes if you want to hold in recess for a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9049)|
| 2:30:54| Is there any opposition to Grassy Valley and Shod?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9054)|
| 2:30:57| I didn't see any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9057)|

| 2:31:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9060)|
| 2:31:01| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9061)|
| 2:31:02| And this one was the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9062)|
| 2:31:06| Hold on just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9066)|
| 2:31:09| I'm trying to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9069)|
| 2:31:12| Yes, this was no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| It was 14 to zero to the recommendation from the Planning Commission was that five units and acres requested by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9074)|
| 2:31:23| It seemed an appropriate location for that density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9083)|
| 2:31:28| If no one minds to give a short recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9088)|
| 2:31:32| Well, I see Commissioner Jay's light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9092)|
| 2:31:35| Go ahead, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9095)|
| 2:31:37| Can I recommend that we just recess the zoning, go back to the commission, finish our business there, and then recess back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9097)|
| 2:31:44| Do a little ping-pong action there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9104)|

| 2:31:48| That's my thoughts exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9108)|
| 2:31:50| So I'll take that as a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9110)|
| 2:31:53| That would be a motion to recess and go back to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9113)|
| 2:31:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9117)|
| 2:31:58| Commissioner Jay has made a motion that was seconded by Commissioner Carringer to go into recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9118)|
| 2:32:05| All in favor of this, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9125)|
| 2:32:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9127)|
| 2:32:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9128)|
| 2:32:09| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9129)|
| 2:32:11| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9131)|
| 2:32:12| The zoning meeting is now officially in recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9132)|
| 2:32:18| I'd now like to bring back from recess the Knox County Commission meeting that was in recess earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9138)|
| 2:32:26| Madam Clerk, where exactly were we in that meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9146)|
| 2:32:29| We were on number 52, page 12, discussion regarding dates for a public hearing and a meeting to appoint a commissioner for the 8th District due to Commissioner Wright's resignation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9149)|
| 2:32:41| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9161)|
| 2:32:43| I know we've got an important discussion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9163)|
| 2:32:45| I worked with Drusilla for a little while this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9165)|
| 2:32:49| Ultimately, I'd like to do what this body deems how this body would like to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9169)|
| 2:32:53| but I do have a suggestion that I'd like to run by y'all to see if these dates and times and if this particular process will work as I look at my calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9173)|
| 2:33:04| Here's an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9184)|
| 2:33:07| What I'd want to propose, just to begin the discussion, would be on December 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9187)|
| 2:33:14| we could have a public forum to interview candidates at 1.30 p.m. in the afternoon, right after lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9194)|
| 2:33:23| That public forum could last from 1.30 to 2 o'clock, and then at 2 o'clock we could have an announced meeting to vote on the matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9203)|
| 2:33:32| and the announcement would read something to the effect of at 2 o'clock or immediately after the public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9212)|
| 2:33:39| a commission could hold a vote to appoint someone to that seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9219)|
| 2:33:45| Knowing that there is, for those who serve on the Disability Committee of the pension, there is a meeting at 3 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9225)|
| 2:33:52| but based on past experience, even if we usually give people five minutes to state their case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9232)|
| 2:33:59| even if we had 10 or 15 applicants, we could probably still get through that at that time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9239)|
| 2:34:05| So that's something we've checked availability on, and I wanted to see if that would work for this body or if there's any other suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9245)|
| 2:34:12| And with that said, Commissioner Schoonmaker, the floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9252)|
| 2:34:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've been thinking about your proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9256)|
| 2:34:23| What I'm wondering is we have to have a meeting at least seven days in advance of a special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9263)|
| 2:34:30| So what if you had a meeting in the afternoon of Wednesday, December 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9270)|
| 2:34:37| we voted on that person on the 5th to sit in that seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9277)|
| 2:34:43| then that way would give that individual some time to get familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9283)|
| 2:34:48| They could go Thursday, Friday, go visit some of the county offices that they needed to get a little bit more understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9288)|
| 2:34:55| because when they're sworn in in public on, say, the 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9295)|
| 2:35:00| they're going to want their family there and to make kind of a big deal about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9300)|
| 2:35:05| But if you have 10, say, potential applicants, you've got to have 10 families show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9305)|
| 2:35:10| I like what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9310)|
| 2:35:15| If we do that on that day, then we could swear them in the next week before that next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9315)|
| 2:35:20| But if this is how the body desires, we could do that on the 5th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9320)|
| 2:35:25| and then have the formal swearing-in ceremony before the work session on the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9325)|
| 2:35:30| Is that basically what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9330)|
| 2:35:35| Right, but he or she would be sworn in on, say, the next morning by a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9335)|
| 2:35:40| Just for an informal swearing-in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9340)|
| 2:35:45| Yeah, there's a difference in a ceremonial swearing-in and a formal swearing-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9345)|
| 2:35:50| So the ceremonial would be whenever they chose to do that in front of the public, and the other one is in the judges' chambers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9350)|
| 2:35:55| All right, so what we have here, I recognize Commissioner Smith's light and then Commissioner Carringer's light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9355)|
| 2:36:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9360)|
| 2:36:05| As far as the formal swearing-in, I don't think it's fair to any person that we vote onto commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9365)|
| 2:36:10| to have them immediately set and be ready for the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9370)|
| 2:36:15| because we know the top priority and focus of anybody that's applying for this is getting six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9375)|
| 2:36:20| It's not being ready for that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9380)|
| 2:36:25| I would rather have a couple days after somebody knows they're the person to be able to go through the agenda in their head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9385)|
| 2:36:30| and be ready for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9390)|
| 2:36:35| Okay, so Randy, you're not for really doing it on the 10th, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9395)|
| 2:36:40| I'm voting with John on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9400)|
| 2:36:45| Well, I had to do that when I was appointed in 7th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9405)|
| 2:36:50| and I know how that feels, and it was quite overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9410)|
| 2:36:56| So I was looking, if we backed it up, and I agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9416)|
| 2:37:04| give them a few days to kind of get their stuff together and look at it and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9424)|
| 2:37:09| So maybe we need to do it, well, or on that 4th, are we talking about later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9429)|
| 2:37:16| you know, maybe we want to do like a later afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9436)|
| 2:37:21| I want to be somewhat sensitive, if we back it up too early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9441)|
| 2:37:26| we want to make sure we're good with our notices, because we're walking into Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9446)|
| 2:37:31| If I had to choose between the 4th and the 5th, I'd rather go with the 5th, just to make sure we've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9451)|
| 2:37:36| in case something happens, an extra day's cushion to get that in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9456)|
| 2:37:41| But with that said, before we make a determination, I'd like to go to Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9461)|
| 2:37:46| Commissioner Schoonmaker, that the 5th would be great, and it would leave enough time to get prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9466)|
| 2:37:51| Okay. Beginning to see some coming together. The only thing I will say is on the 5th, at 11 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9471)|
| 2:37:56| I'm taking my son to the dentist. So as long as we can move it to that afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9476)|
| 2:38:01| Yeah, I think we should do it later afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9481)|
| 2:38:06| And I'm saying that somewhat in jest, because we don't usually do things at 11 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9486)|
| 2:38:12| All right, I'm seeing 4 o'clock. So a public forum to interview the candidates at 4 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9492)|
| 2:38:18| followed by at 5 o'clock, or immediately upon conclusion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9498)|
| 2:38:25| So that would give us a little bit of flexibility in case we finish a little bit early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9505)|
| 2:38:30| Does that sound appropriate for this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9510)|
| 2:38:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Have we checked to see the availability of this room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9513)|
| 2:38:38| We can put a hold on it. Drusilla, what are you hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9518)|
| 2:38:43| We can kick out who's ever here anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9523)|
| 2:38:48| I'm just curious, is there any city council meetings? Are there any other bodies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9528)|
| 2:38:51| Not on Wednesdays. Well, school board. That's what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9531)|
| 2:38:56| Are they that night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9536)|
| 2:38:59| Would it be a voting meeting? I'd prefer not to do it next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9539)|
| 2:39:04| 2 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9544)|
| 2:39:08| The 6th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9548)|
| 2:39:11| No. We're starting to get into Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9551)|
| 2:39:15| Not for another 20 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9555)|
| 2:39:17| I think the 5th is a great day. It's just a matter of where we're going to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9557)|
| 2:39:20| and if we want to make it a little bit earlier so it's not a conflict with their school board, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9560)|
| 2:39:24| I would say we'd shoot for the 5th at 4 and 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9564)|
| 2:39:29| and if that's not available so that we don't have to get back together to come with another date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9569)|
| 2:39:34| we have an alternative date, which would be the 6th at 4 and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9574)|
| 2:39:39| Surely one of those two are available for this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9579)|
| 2:39:44| Okay. Commissioner Jack, I can't hear you. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9584)|
| 2:39:47| That is the school board's confirmed date and time, so we would just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9587)|
| 2:39:52| Is it the 5th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9592)|
| 2:39:55| The 5th. It's the first Wednesday of each month at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9595)|
| 2:39:58| We could move this up earlier in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9598)|
| 2:40:01| We could go with a 3 o'clock hearing and a 4 o'clock vote, or immediately after our public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9601)|
| 2:40:09| That would be wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9609)|
| 2:40:12| We could do the hearing on the 5th at 3 o'clock, which would probably not interfere with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9612)|
| 2:40:21| Mr. Chairman, your original time on the 10th was 1.30. Why don't we stick with 1.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9621)|
| 2:40:27| That would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9627)|
| 2:40:32| Can I make a suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9632)|
| 2:40:34| Let's go with 2 o'clock unless the school board is not meeting in this room and we can use it at 4 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9634)|
| 2:40:41| and you can determine that in the office tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9641)|
| 2:40:45| They are meeting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9645)|
| 2:40:48| They need to find a new place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9648)|
| 2:40:51| Go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9651)|
| 2:40:56| On behalf of employed people who have day jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9656)|
| 2:41:02| 8 to 10 people depending on how many of them take off to come just to interview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9662)|
| 2:41:07| I think we should just move it to Thursday the 6th and have it later in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9667)|
| 2:41:12| 4 and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9672)|
| 2:41:14| All right. Well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9674)|
| 2:41:16| I'm seeing heads nodding around this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9676)|
| 2:41:19| What do you all want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9679)|
| 2:41:20| I could propose it for 4 o'clock on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9680)|
| 2:41:23| I'm also one of those people that works that has to leave the office to come to these meetings, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9683)|
| 2:41:26| But go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9686)|
| 2:41:28| I'm out of town on the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9688)|
| 2:41:29| I would love to participate in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| Are we not allowed to use any other room but this room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9691)|
| 2:41:34| Can this not be in the small assembly next door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9694)|
| 2:41:37| It has to be video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9697)|
| 2:41:40| They have video over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9700)|
| 2:41:41| You can't have simultaneous meetings going on and be shown on CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9701)|
| 2:41:47| It's required to show on CTV?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9707)|
| 2:41:50| Record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9710)|
| 2:41:51| Are you out the 7th, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9711)|
| 2:41:53| Yes, I'm on a work trip 6 and 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9713)|
| 2:41:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9716)|
| 2:41:58| What time does the school board end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9718)|
| 2:42:01| School board starts at 5. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9721)|
| 2:42:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9724)|
| 2:42:05| Let's meet on the 5th at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9725)|
| 2:42:08| 5th at 2 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9728)|
| 2:42:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9731)|
| 2:42:12| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9732)|
| 2:42:13| I was just wondering what time the school board ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9733)|
| 2:42:15| If it's a short meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9735)|
| 2:42:17| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9737)|
| 2:42:18| We don't know what time it ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9738)|
| 2:42:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9740)|
| 2:42:23| It's the 5th at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9743)|
| 2:42:25| Hear what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9745)|
| 2:42:26| I don't know if all of us come together on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9746)|
| 2:42:28| but the 5th at 2 o'clock has been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9748)|
| 2:42:31| It's possible we could do it at 3 to 4 o'clock and vote right at 4 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9751)|
| 2:42:35| which would give the school board time probably to get in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9755)|
| 2:42:39| I don't think they do a pre-meeting in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9759)|
| 2:42:41| but if we met at 3, that might be a good balance with a later afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9761)|
| 2:42:47| so people could leave work at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9767)|
| 2:42:50| You're saying 2, and you're saying thumbs up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9770)|
| 2:42:54| 2 or 3, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9774)|
| 2:42:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9776)|
| 2:42:57| So we agree on the 5th, and I've got a crazy idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9777)|
| 2:43:00| I'm going to ask the commission, let's say we go at the 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9780)|
| 2:43:03| and I want, if you think 2 o'clock, everybody go like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9783)|
| 2:43:06| and if you think 3 o'clock, go like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9786)|
| 2:43:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9789)|
| 2:43:10| All right, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9790)|
| 2:43:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9792)|
| 2:43:13| Hold them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9793)|
| 2:43:14| I'm serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9794)|
| 2:43:15| Don't be playing the BS, playing that with the two hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9795)|
| 2:43:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9799)|
| 2:43:20| Hold them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9800)|
| 2:43:21| 2 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9801)|
| 2:43:22| Let's do a roll call vote on this, 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9802)|
| 2:43:27| I'd like to vote for 2.30, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9807)|
| 2:43:34| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9814)|
| 2:43:39| Let's do, oh, you can split it at 2.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9819)|
| 2:43:42| 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9822)|
| 2:43:43| We're going to decide at 2.30, and we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9823)|
| 2:43:45| It's right down the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9825)|
| 2:43:46| We're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9826)|
| 2:43:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9827)|
| 2:43:48| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9828)|
| 2:43:49| Don't say I'm not trying to listen to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9829)|
| 2:43:50| Then we need to make sure that they have their applications in to the commission office by X date and X time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9830)|
| 2:44:00| We need to establish that now so it goes in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9840)|
| 2:44:04| I don't think that applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9844)|
| 2:44:07| I mean, anybody can walk up at any time and can be nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9847)|
| 2:44:11| We do want to make a statement, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9851)|
| 2:44:14| I might suggest that the verbiage can be, say, something along the lines of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9854)|
| 2:44:18| for the commission to properly review your resume and application, please have it in by Monday the 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9858)|

| 2:44:52| Suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9892)|
| 2:44:53| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9893)|

| 2:45:17| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9917)|
| 2:45:18| I think we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9918)|
| 2:45:20| Is that our last item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9920)|
| 2:45:21| We're going back to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9921)|
| 2:45:22| Yeah, zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9922)|
| 2:45:23| That's what I meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9923)|
| 2:45:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9924)|
| 2:45:25| Would you entertain a motion for closing this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9925)|

| 2:46:36| Mr. Green, is there anyone from MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9996)|
| 2:46:39| I think he read, that's the reason he read it before he left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=9999)|
| 2:46:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=10002)|

| 2:46:49| I see that this has come to us, that it came to us, recommended for approval, planned residential zoning at a density of up to five dwelling units per acre by a vote of 14 to nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=10009)|
| 2:47:01| So you had unanimous approval at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=10021)|
| 2:47:04| Would you please tell us a little bit about this district, or excuse me, about what this development is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=10024)|
| 2:47:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=10030)|
| 2:47:11| We bought the property, I think, in 2009, 2010, with hopes of doing commercial with its good location to the new intersection of Shod Road and Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=10031)|
| 2:47:20| We thought it would be a good place for maybe a seesaw or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=10040)|
| 2:47:24| Well, we ended up buying the property to the east, a larger tract, 168 acres on the other side of Blakewood, and it will have commercial in the front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=10044)|
| 2:47:34| And we're in the need of single-family residential lots and carns right now, so what we've decided to do is down-zone the property from commercial to PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=10054)|
| 2:47:42| allowing us to get 33 of what we call a villa product or a floor plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=10062)|
| 2:47:47| It's a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath, 2,200 square feet that we sell for about $215,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=10067)|
| 2:47:53| So we have 33 of those laid out on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=10073)|
| 2:47:57| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=10077)|
