| 0:02:55| We just purchased Bradford Catered Events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| and so his license had to be terminated and reapplied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=178)|

| 0:05:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| Being the county commissioner for District 2 where this is going to be over on Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| I just want to say congratulations to Mr. Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| and I would like for you to tell the rest of the commission the other businesses that you own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| and operate, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| Just a short statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Me and my wife got started about 18 years ago in business here in Knoxville with $300 in our pocket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=339)|
| 0:05:46| and we started All Occasion Catering, which is our flagship company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| And so from there we have grown to own Jackson Terminal, a wedding venue in downtown Knoxville in the Old City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=350)|
| 0:05:58| When we moved All Occasion Catering from South Knoxville to what's now the Downtown North Renovation Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| it wasn't in 08, the neighborhood, that it is now vibrant and growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| We've been proud to be a part of the Knox County, Knoxville City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| And then about 18 months ago we purchased Creative Catering in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| It has become a brand inside of our All Occasion Catering commissary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| And then Bradford Catering was one of our larger competitors, and due to having children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| he decided he wanted to spend more time with family than out seven days a week and in the wee hours of the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=386)|
| 0:06:33| And so now we've acquired that, and our goal is to build a legacy in Knoxville similar to other restauranteurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| you know, just in the catering world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| And so hopefully we're well on our way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| And I would like to just move that we make a motion to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| Subject to surrendering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| Was it already surrendered or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| No, there's an outstanding license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| So for the surrendering of the outstanding beer license that Bradford had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| I will contact Bradford Jones right after this meeting, and I will have him down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=432)|

| 0:07:16| Okay, we have a motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=443)|
| 0:07:24| And who do I need to have him see in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| See the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=450)|

| 0:08:19| Beer has been sold at this location before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| To my knowledge, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Before we were there, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| There is currently an outstanding license, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| To my knowledge, while cleaning up, I did find their old permit, so I don't know how active it is, but I do have that with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=512)|
| 0:08:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| That will have to be surrendered to the clerk's office before yours can be issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=524)|

| 0:09:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=558)|

| 0:10:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| I would like to make a motion that we approve this pending the surrender of the outstanding license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=606)|
| 0:10:14| from the Health Department, Fire Department, and Codes, a final inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=614)|
| 0:10:20| and also a certificate of occupancy from Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| And that sounds like all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| Certification of registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| Certification of registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| Those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| Certification of registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| And the motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| I'll check with Ms. Krause there to get a packet from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| She's with the Metro Drug Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| That will help you make sure you have a very successful time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| Oh, you got it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| She's on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| She got me when I walked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| Discussion regarding Fire Marshal and Codes Department inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=662)|
| 0:11:09| Commissioner Boesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| What I wanted to bring up here, and I thought I was going to be shooting with nothing in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| but we have where they came up before us and there's pending inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| And what I wanted to ask about, do you have a packet that you give to an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| when they apply for like the beer permit that they have to meet these certain code lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| or these are the items that they need to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| Or is it just how do you explain to somebody when they come and apply for that business license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| what they need to have before they come up before the commission to grant the beer license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=703)|
| 0:11:51| Typically what will happen, I get the request for the beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| It's sent up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| At that point, I make contact with the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| and let them know what they need to do to work towards getting their certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=723)|
| 0:12:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| So do you give them the things that they need in writing or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=731)|
| 0:12:20| Would they do a checklist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| We make the phone call, tell them what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| Usually they go through codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| Codes will tell them what they need to bring up to apply for their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| In codes, do you give them a checklist when you go out and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| okay, this has to be upgraded, this has to be upgraded and things of that sort before they get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=761)|
| 0:12:48| I actually don't deal with it until we're over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| Use the mic, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| I don't deal with the sites until we're researching the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| and that's the only part that I deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| As far as I know, there's not a checklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| I can talk to someone about putting one together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| And the health department, when they come through, you just say, hey, here's what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| There's no written instructions or anything like that that you give to them for what they need to meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| Usually they call or they've already applied for the building, and we tell them we have a checklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=798)|
| 0:13:28| So if there's someone, we have a packet that we actually give them, and they have to submit plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| So when they call in and say that they want to open up a restaurant, a bar, or catering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=813)|
| 0:13:42| we will send them a packet, and it will tell them step-by-step what they need to submit to our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=822)|
| 0:13:49| Okay, and I'm not trying to do a gotcha or anything like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| but from what I hear from you all right now, it starts in codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| and then codes gives to the fire department for inspection, and then comes to the health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=836)|
| 0:14:05| Is that the order in which they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| They would apply for their apartment through county codes. That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| And then the codes give?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| Okay, so then it comes to you for your inspection of fire, and then it goes to the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| So those three, it goes in that kind of order, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| Well, Sandra will send me a copy up of the agenda, and that's what I work off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=863)|
| 0:14:31| And then as the inspectors go out and sign off on the projects, they will email me or notify me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=871)|
| 0:14:38| I go back and mark them off, you know, if they're pending or if they're approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| Okay, is there any particular thing that shows up over and over and over when you do your inspection that's a common occurrence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=884)|
| 0:14:54| I really can't speak on that because typically the new construction inspectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=894)|
| 0:15:00| are the ones that go out and do the billboard inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| and then they will communicate to me whether they passed or failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| Okay, and the only reason I'm asking these questions is sometimes you have a mom-and-pop startup operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=908)|
| 0:15:15| and they've invested money, and they need to get in business right away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| and I didn't know if there's a way where you had something writing down that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| now these are common occurrences, these are ones that you really need to look at first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| and then so when they come up here, they're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| All we have to do is kind of say somebody makes a motion, somebody seconds it, and we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| I don't know how we can streamline it to make it better for that kind of operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| especially, like I say, the mom-and-pop that really needs to get into business real quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| and that's the only reason I'm asking those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| No, like I said, we try to communicate with them as soon as we get the request emailed to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=950)|
| 0:15:59| We will go back, look at them, go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| You know, if necessary, we'll go out on site and meet with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| Okay, but there's really no common occurrence that occurs time after time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| that they're not looking for or anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| There's not really a unique or a common thing that occurs multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=973)|
| 0:16:20| Well, what we typically look for is for codes to issue the permit, and that's the first thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=980)|
| 0:16:27| When I get the beer board agenda, that's the first thing I check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| is to see if they've already pulled a permit, because 75% of the time, they already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=991)|
| 0:16:39| If not, I will notify them and let them know what they need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| and tell them who they need to be in touch with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| That's all I need to know. I appreciate it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| Any further discussion? We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1014)|

| 0:17:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| Before we get started, there's a couple of elected officials in the audience I want to acknowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| That's close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| The new vice mayor for the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| We also have Ron Williams, who was just elected mayor of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| We have Superintendent Bob Thomas and Mayor Tim Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1066)|
| 0:17:52| I believe I called everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| I see Councilwoman Welch back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| Kathy Quist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| They're all going to be recognized later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| Commissioner Nystrom, will you please do our devotional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| Before I do it, I'm going to be introducing a group to many of y'all, as well as a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| of dear friends of mine who are in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| When we're given the opportunity to say a devotional, often many of us bring a pastor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| from our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| In this case, I wanted to bring some representatives from my men's group, which actually is part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| of all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| The group is called F3, which stands for Fitness, Fellowship, and Faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| It is a free men's and we have a women's equivalent workout group that I guess I could best describe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| as a 45-minute beat-down workout followed by about a five-minute Bible study that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| gather almost every day here in Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| I was just out there with these guys in the gloom this morning at 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| It's a national movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| When we were in Murfreesboro for the training, I found a chapter in Murfreesboro that I worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| out with just last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| The mission is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| F3's mission is to plant, grow, and serve small workout groups for the invigoration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| of community leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| So I'm going to go ahead and introduce my friend Chris DeFranco to tell you all a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| bit more about the group and to lead tonight's devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| It's a very important part of my life and I wanted to share it with all of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| The health that we're impacting for our community, we're bringing over 500 free, 500 folks plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1174)|
| 0:19:41| are being touched by free workouts in this community to help our health as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| So go ahead, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| Thank you for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| My name is Chris DeFranco, resident of West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| Thanks for having me, Pluto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| We have kind of nicknames during our group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| It just kind of allows us to be more of a fraternity type feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| It's very laid back and we accept all faiths, of course, but it's really gotten myself in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1201)|
| 0:20:08| shape in the last couple years and it's allowed me to bond with other men that have like-minded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| attitudes, that want to serve the community, that want to better our community and work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| with people like the Wesley House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| We do community events, kickball tournaments just recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| We've done obstacle course races together as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| And it's just really empowering to be around other men that really want to change the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| that they live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| So anything you need from F3, we're happy to step in and do that for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| So thank you for the opportunity to pray this morning or this evening as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| I'm not a pastor, so I'll probably just stumble all over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| I would say we have a women's equivalent as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| My wife actually just started that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| It's called FIA and it stands for Females in Action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| Basically the same thing, but a female version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| And they meet at what we call the asylum, which is the, what's the name of that park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| So we have locations all throughout Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| So you can pretty much find one at F3Knoxville.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Say a blessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for allowing us to come together under you, Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| We just pray that these council members here, Lord, can listen to what's being presented this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1280)|
| 0:21:28| give them the knowledge and the understanding of each situation, Lord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| and make them have the right decision that's best for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| We just thank you so much for allowing us to come together in a free country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| and be able to worship you without any kind of persecution, Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| We just thank you so much for all that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| In Jesus' name, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| Commissioner Daly, will you please lead us in the pledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| If we all would rise and do the proper salute to our nation's flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1330)|
| 0:22:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| Okay, we're to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| Ralph Eakins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| Ralph Eakins here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1352)|
| 0:22:41| Scott Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| If you would, please give your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| and you have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| Yeah, Scott Davis, PO Box 11315, Knoxville 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| And I appreciate y'all's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| And for those leaving commission, thank you for your service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| and appreciate all the time and energy y'all put into your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| I know many of y'all saw this article pretty recently in the Knoxville paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| Soaring Tennessee home prices push American dream out of reach for many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| Study finds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| Everything we do from MPC to planning, zoning, all of these things affect home prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| Y'all have heard me come up here several times and talk about the policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| and things going on with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| And I just want to reiterate a little bit more about how that affects housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| how it affects housing prices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| and how it makes the American dream out of reach for a lot of folks here in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1412)|
| 0:23:38| And it starts with the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| If I contracted to buy a piece of property on January 1 of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| to go through zoning, concept plan approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| it would take six and a half months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| That's before engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| That's before TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| So that whole process is about a 12-month process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| So through this, you're asking property owners to hold their land at bay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| for 12 months before they can sell the family's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| In some cases, this may involve an inheritance and to try to settle a family estate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| or settle federal or state tax issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| It's a tremendous burden on folks and their property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| If you have to go through a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| and it goes from MPC to county commission back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| that process only takes about nine and a half months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| Our planning processes are killing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| Our planning processes, the over-planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| We have sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| We have growth plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| We have growth policy plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| I think there's nine different types of plans that we have to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| And it's incredibly confusing for everybody, and it's costing taxpayers a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| and it's putting people and their families' lives at risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| and also it makes affordable housing out of reach for most folks here in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| Thank you all again for your time and your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| Herb Monsier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| If you would please state your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| Herbert Monsier, 550 West Main Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| Listening to F3, I think maybe I should have gone down there this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| It made me feel a little bit guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| I was trying to think how to express myself other than I've expressed myself in the papers that I have sent to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1527)|
| 0:25:36| and the best way that I can think about doing it is to possibly have Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1536)|
| 0:25:43| think a little bit out of the box from where you have been basically placed in by the way we do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1543)|
| 0:25:52| I have never been a big fan of just doing things the way we do things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1552)|
| 0:25:59| and quite often it takes people who are able to venture out and look beyond that which we are told from within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1559)|
| 0:26:08| to make decisions that affect our form of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1568)|
| 0:26:16| and I give that preface to explain to you the importance of a very unique situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1576)|
| 0:26:25| that has been cast upon all of the employees of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| who are participants in the pension plans that you have adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1591)|
| 0:26:38| They did not choose to be placed in the position of defendants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1598)|
| 0:26:45| Your law director, my friend, Mr. Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| made a decision that he believes that the pension board was computing their benefits for all these many years incorrectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1610)|
| 0:27:02| The problem is he represented the pension board, of course, and there was a conflict of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| and all of a sudden we're outside that box I just talked to you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| Because all of a sudden what you're confronted with is a law director that cannot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1633)|
| 0:27:20| because of a conflict of interest, do his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1640)|
| 0:27:29| That is the essential of a vacancy in that office for that very limited purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| I don't want to be misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| But for that purpose, Mr. Armstrong cannot represent Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1658)|
| 0:27:45| But Mr. Armstrong went out and he hired his campaign treasurer and his personal attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1665)|
| 0:27:55| to represent Knox County against all of its employees with the public's money and the public's treasury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1675)|
| 0:28:09| And let me tell you that the cast of the power of the public's treasury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| has fallen on the shoulders of every employee of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| Currently, it has fallen on the shoulders of 485 members of the uniformed services that you have created this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1699)|
| 0:28:30| and it has been in existence and it has operated since 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| Now, the reason I'm here and I'm out of time is that on September the 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| the chancellor is expecting someone to come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| and to be a representative of these 485 people in what's known as a class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1727)|
| 0:28:54| That's sort of where we started this, and Captain Carson came to me and agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1734)|
| 0:29:02| that if we could get the funding to where he could adequately and fully represent that class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| he will step forward and he will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| But there's just one catch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| The treasury of Knox County has fallen on the shoulders of the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| but the employees don't have the treasury of Knox County to defend themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| Now, it's been cast by my friend, Director Armstrong, and well, the charter doesn't permit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1764)|
| 0:29:32| That's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| You are the trustees of the treasury of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| You have the authority to appropriate the funds of this county to stand behind your employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1780)|
| 0:29:49| to give them a fighting chance in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| And I came before you last Monday in good faith, telling you what we were about, trying to explain it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| I thought I was on the agenda to where we could get a vote tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| because we owe to this chancellor a report as to where this mammoth litigation is going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1803)|
| 0:30:12| It is this private attorney and his law firm that are pushing forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| but yet pulling back on anybody able to defend themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| Now, we're willing to go forward and willing to go forward on the fast schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| but we've got to be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| Neither I or any attorney is not going to take on a class of 485 people free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1831)|
| 0:30:39| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| I've used my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| I have also called in for Ms. Kelly Mann to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1847)|
| 0:30:58| I don't know if I even have a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| If I could have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| I just want to reiterate what Mr. Monsier was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| We have the potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| My name is Kelly Mann on behalf of Holyfield Janitor Sheldon Ferreira,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| and we currently represent seven named defendants in a lawsuit that Knox County has brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| that are retired sheriff's officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| As Mr. Monsier was saying, on September 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| Chancellor Weaver will be deciding whether there will be a class action certification for this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| One of the factors he will have to consider is whether that class can be adequately represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| Like Mr. Monsier was trying to say, if there's not funding, then no attorney will take that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| And then the judge will have to dismiss the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| and then Knox County is potentially going to be in for 485 lawsuits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| depending on if these officers have accrued leave, cashed out, factored into their pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1906)|
| 0:31:53| So time is of the essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| So that's why we couldn't wait until September's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| because we really wanted to get this before you as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| George Underwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1925)|
| 0:32:16| If you would, sir, please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Can I move my five minutes associated with the agenda item itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| Yes, sir, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| Vivian Scheib.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1951)|
| 0:32:42| Hello, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| If you would, please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Vivian Underwood Scheib, 2340 East Magnolia, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1966)|
| 0:32:52| I thank you for the opportunity to speak to you guys today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| I'm here to talk about the least of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| and that's the subject that I want to bring before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| And I think it's fitting and I think it's not a consequence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| that I bring it before you on the eve of the changing of this guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| I don't use the term lightly or in a derogatory way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| I use it as it describes a group of people who have been left behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| on the train of progression in the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| I speak of the homeless, the poor, the family or individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| struggling to have affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| For too long, it has been a burden for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| I feel in order for change to occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| it must become a burden on the hearts of the leadership of our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| and the citizens and property owners of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| Now, we've been here before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| Years ago, this commission saw the need for the Behavioral Health Care Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| for the mentally ill and developed a task force of strategic stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| who felt that burden enough to change lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| I was honored to serve on that task force, and I saw firsthand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| what a burden for our fellow man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| coupled with cooperation of all resources, can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| That building opened five months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| And as of June 9th, 90 individuals with mental illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| have come through those doors and received life-changing help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| But you see, all of that started right here in this room with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| This problem is not unique to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| I serve on a state pre-arrest diversion task force, and it's everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| from Johnson City to Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=2079)|

| 1:19:21| About a year ago, I had planned to retire from the real estate business and just kind of kick back and relax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4761)|
| 1:19:27| I guess this went out the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| But one of the things that I am proudest of winning the award last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| Academy of Country Music Award for Nightclub of the Year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| we were one of five nightclubs that were nominated throughout the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| So when we got that email that we had won, it was quite the honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| But like Commissioner Thomas read, we play the national anthem every night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| That's one of my proudest achievements of the club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4787)|
| 1:19:57| I want to go back and make sure that two of the people that signed up for public forum haven't showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| Ralph Aikens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4802)|
| 1:20:08| Al Holifield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4808)|
| 1:20:16| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| Approval of minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4826)|
| 1:20:27| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| Brings us to amendment to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| I have two items that are on the agenda that need to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| That's item 37 and 51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| These were on the work session, so we're going to vote these together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| And then I have another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| Do I have a motion to add items 37 and 51?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4853)|
| 1:20:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4854)|
| 1:20:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| Those two will be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| Commissioner Schoonmaker had brought some changes to the audit committee policy on terms for commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4861)|
| 1:21:09| He brought it to us last week and gave us a week to look it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4869)|
| 1:21:15| I believe he wants to get this done before we do our reorganization meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4875)|
| 1:21:21| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| I'm going to make a motion that we add to the agenda R18-8-906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4884)|
| 1:21:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| That's another matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| Yeah, I believe we're going to withdraw item 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| Is this the time to do that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4907)|
| 1:21:48| Not postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| I mean not withdraw, but postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| So we have a motion and a second to add this resolution to be heard last under all the resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4916)|
| 1:22:06| This will take a majority vote, a super majority vote, two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4926)|
| 1:22:13| And let's try this just with voice call first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4933)|
| 1:22:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| The item has been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| At this point, we heard from Herb Muncier he wants to add something to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4946)|
| 1:22:33| I would like to get input from fellow commissioners on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4958)|
| 1:22:39| Well, that's why I was going to, I guess if we could add, the only concern I have is the open pocket book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4959)|
| 1:22:47| and the open purse on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| I don't know what the cost of it is, but I voted in favor of this last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4968)|
| 1:22:53| and I'd like to find a way to have a discussion about this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| So I'll somehow make a resolution or somehow get on the agenda to where we can potentially vote something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4976)|
| 1:23:03| or have a discussion on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| I would like to hear from some of the current members of the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4986)|
| 1:23:10| They've got a lot more knowledge than the rest of us sitting on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=4994)|
| 1:23:23| I'll chime in first on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| To say it's a complicated matter would be a really big understatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5005)|
| 1:23:32| There's, what they are looking to decide at the hearing in September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5012)|
| 1:23:42| is really whether to establish a class for the current employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5022)|
| 1:23:50| I mean, with this matter that is not decided is we have a class of employees who are retired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5030)|
| 1:23:59| and then we've got a class of employees who are still currently working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5039)|
| 1:24:03| as it relates to just bringing up kind of what Mr. Monsier had brought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| Ultimately, just to review, the whole question at hand is the pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5047)|
| 1:24:13| if you can use the vacation payout or post-severance payout in the calculation of a pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5053)|
| 1:24:23| As it relates specifically to Mr. Monsier, is do we as a commission have to up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5063)|
| 1:24:32| kind of say we're going to pay for the legal fees if that status is granted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5072)|
| 1:24:38| I can't remember exactly what he had mentioned at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| I know he had mentioned this being fast-tracked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| Yes, it has been fast-tracked to a certain extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| I'll shift from county commissioner and put my pension fund hat on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5087)|
| 1:24:53| We've really wanted, this is something that's actually been going on for about two years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| If it goes all the way back to Greg Gass filing an appeal, to hearing it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5097)|
| 1:25:04| to coming up before the pension committee and then having a declaratory judgment filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5104)|
| 1:25:12| What a declaratory judgment is, is basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| and I think both sides in this probably wanted to get to having a declaratory judgment filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| is we've taken it to get a judge to answer a question where, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| we've gotten a lot of questions and a lot of good arguments on both sides of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| Where we've got the law department has said one thing, the pension board attorneys have said another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5131)|
| 1:25:36| and none of us being attorneys, I think a lot of folks on our pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| wanted to really get to court to get an answer on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5141)|
| 1:25:46| So we as a board at the pension board have really kind of been pushing our attorneys to get this to trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5146)|
| 1:25:54| Whether you exclude a class in this decision or not, that's really where I get a little confused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5154)|
| 1:26:00| and frankly, Phil, I don't know if conflicted is the right word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| but is Mr. Monsier's proposing that we kind of up front say that we'll pay if this class is granted for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5163)|
| 1:26:14| and then I guess doing my little Google legal research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| do you have to have prepayment guaranteed for the class to be granted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| If class was granted, would it make sense to, even though we've pushed to have it fast-tracked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5186)|
| 1:26:36| if the class status is granted, does it make sense to push it back another month from the date that we got in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5196)|
| 1:26:44| so that you could sort of consolidate the class with the defense that the pension board is already putting up for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5204)|
| 1:26:52| In a way, to get a good final kind of answer on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| one reason why the pension board has to disagree with my friend Bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| We're friends, but my thought on the whole thing has been if you want to get a decision that sticks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5220)|
| 1:27:07| both sides really need to put up a good fight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| and then if a judgment renders a decision based on both sides kind of coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5230)|
| 1:27:16| and giving good arguments on both sides, then that kind of gets you to sort of a final answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5236)|
| 1:27:22| And what this sort of boils down to for me is if class is granted in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| does that impact the ability to get to sort of a final answer in this declaratory judgment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| So those are not very well-organized thoughts, but just some of the things that are out there to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5252)|
| 1:27:40| Commissioner Brownlee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| In my four years on county commission, I've served on the pension and retirement board all those four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5263)|
| 1:27:51| and I have some reflections on that board and how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5271)|
| 1:27:56| When I went on the board, being from private business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| I could not understand why there were so many attorneys at each of our meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| and we were paying them so much money, when in fact you could have one attorney who worked for that board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5283)|
| 1:28:09| and sat in that office and would not spend a quarter of what this board spends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5289)|
| 1:28:15| However, that's not the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| I am against this class action at this time, and the reason why is we've already spent this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5297)|
| 1:28:23| over a quarter of a million dollars in attorney fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| That's not the county money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| That's retirees' money, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| That's your savings that's going to pay for lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| And until the judge makes a determination what is going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5314)|
| 1:28:39| I would not add a class action suit until he says this is how we're going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5319)|
| 1:28:44| There's no reason to do this because all you're going to do is push the can on down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5324)|
| 1:28:50| It's just going to keep going down the road, more attorneys, more money, more money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5330)|
| 1:28:54| and I'll bet you by the end of the year if we keep this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| it'll be over a million dollars spent on attorneys and we still won't have a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| Now, today is my last day on commission, and I've had a wonderful four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5342)|
| 1:29:08| and I've enjoyed being on the Pension and Retirement Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| but I can tell you that the way that board works is not the way it's going to need to work in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| or we're going to be broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| Just too many lawyers, too many problems in that form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| But I do believe if we pass this today that it will pretty much put us in a huge deficit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5362)|
| 1:29:29| and will extend us for a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| I believe Chancellor Weaver has the information he needs right now to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5371)|
| 1:29:36| I mean, we've had all the information we've got, we've given it to the chancellor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| and he can make a decision on his own time when he's ready to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| But there's no reason to add any more names, any more, until he decides what he wants to do in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5384)|
| 1:29:50| And that's my opinion. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| I guess my question, I don't know who the proper, I guess law director's offices can answer it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| I guess because they're out of the equation on that, on the conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5400)|
| 1:30:05| But if they're added in as a class, why wouldn't the pension board's attorneys represent them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| as well as they are representing the retirees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| I mean, if it's a class add, they're all, I mean, the county's suing the county already, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5414)|
| 1:30:22| So if it's a class action, why wouldn't the pension board's lawyers pick that fee up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5422)|
| 1:30:28| That's just it. You know, I haven't seen a divergent interest between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5428)|
| 1:30:33| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| I'm sorry. I haven't seen a divergent interest between the two groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| Ultimately, the pension board lawyers are trying to argue for the same thing that, I would guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5439)|
| 1:30:45| that Mr. Monsier and the group for the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| So I would effectively think that they're the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5448)|
| 1:30:52| Honestly, I was a little surprised that this didn't come through the pension board first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| But that is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5456)|
| 1:31:01| So if the pension board is representing themselves, which in turn represents their clients as recipients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5461)|
| 1:31:12| I mean, can we get an answer on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| Why would it not be, why do we need a class action lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| And why wouldn't the pension board represent the class action lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| Because it's the same recipient versus retiree or active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5481)|
| 1:31:30| Currently, this very issue is before Chancellor Weaver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| He will review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| There is no divergence between the retirees and those that have already retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| We have just asked the court the question, what should the formula be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| In his first ruling, the Chancellor has stated that all the facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5507)|
| 1:31:55| it's a matter of question of law and everything that he needs is before him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| He will be ruling as to whether he's going to certify a class or not on the 7th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5519)|
| 1:32:04| and a motion to dismiss on the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| After that, we will have a clear vision as to what, if anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5526)|
| 1:32:11| we need to do in terms of funding something or not funding something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| And that really is also issues of law that the Chancellor can direct the parties to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5535)|
| 1:32:22| And that's kind of where we are on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| But I don't see much difference between, if any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| The board's attorneys represent the board's beneficiaries and the board itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| We have some certiorari attorneys who are representing administrative hearings separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5553)|
| 1:32:39| But the board wants to know what the answer to the question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5559)|
| 1:32:44| The law director in the county wants to know what the answer to the question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| And that's what's before the Chancellor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| Can I ask Mr. Monsier to respond to that so we can have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| First of all, I'm going to respond by good faith to Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| Is he in this or is he out of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| And what he's doing in the background is he's running the engine for what he decided to do to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5579)|
| 1:33:07| And that's not what a recusal's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| And I object to what he just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| I'll answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| Since 2006, the pension board has made a decision as to how to calculate the benefits not only for the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5595)|
| 1:33:27| Mr. Monsier, can we not try the case and just answer the question as in regard to if they come in as a class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5607)|
| 1:33:35| why would the board not represent them as well as the retirees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| There is a claim by all of the employees of Knox County that if they have been given a pension benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5618)|
| 1:33:45| and it's now determined that it was not properly given by the retirement board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5625)|
| 1:33:50| that there's an action against the retirement board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| They do have a divergent of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| Now, on the surface, that if the retirement board was correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5636)|
| 1:34:01| which all of the uniformed members say it was correct, and I believe that it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5641)|
| 1:34:07| if that prevails, then there is not a divergence of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5647)|
| 1:34:12| However, on the other hand, if it does not prevail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| there is a drastic divergence of interest between not only the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| but between a number of the different classes that are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| The suggestion that we should wait for Chancellor Weaver is flawed in this aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5665)|
| 1:34:32| Chancellor Weaver cannot certify a class unless there is a representative of that class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5672)|
| 1:34:41| who has the financial ability to represent 485 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5681)|
| 1:34:46| That is a criteria to certify a class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| That's why I have spent so much of my time, since this came up on August 1st before Chancellor Weaver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5690)|
| 1:34:56| Mr. Armstrong wasn't there, I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| We do want to expedite it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| We are willing to cooperate on the uniformed services officers to cooperate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5702)|
| 1:35:07| However, no attorney is going to take upon a class of representing 485 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5707)|
| 1:35:14| without somehow getting paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| And these people don't have the capacity to pay that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| and the Chancellor has to find before he certifies a class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5719)|
| 1:35:25| that there is a full and adequate means by which that representative can represent the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5725)|
| 1:35:32| Can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| Yes, sir. I don't know where it's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| From the chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5735)|
| 1:35:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| If Chancellor Weaver, who knows our charter very well, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5738)|
| 1:35:45| if he forms a class, and your assumption is correct about being able to fund defense for employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5745)|
| 1:35:53| then he will know and order at that time that Knox County fund that class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5753)|
| 1:35:59| Well, I have done some very quick research as to whether he has the authority to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5759)|
| 1:36:05| and I cannot tell you that I have found authority that he does not have the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5765)|
| 1:36:11| However, I have found no authority that he has the authority to order Knox County to pay for the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5771)|
| 1:36:18| There is no such authority to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| You're saying our charter gives the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| I'm saying the charter gives this commission the authority to appropriate funds for any lawful purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5784)|
| 1:36:31| and I'm saying that representing the employees who have been sued by Knox County is certainly a lawful purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5791)|
| 1:36:39| and that's what gives you the authority to appropriate the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| And then couldn't Judge Weaver just order us to fund them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5803)|
| 1:36:49| My answer to that is just as I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| I have found no authority that says he cannot, and I have found no authority that says that he can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5812)|
| 1:36:59| And my guess is that, Chancellor Weaver, that is not what we discussed with the private attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5819)|
| 1:37:06| that were seeking to expedite this on August the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5826)|
| 1:37:12| And, sir, I agree with one thing that I've heard here said tonight without any question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5832)|
| 1:37:20| Loading this lawsuit up with the attorney fees to date, almost a quarter of a million dollars, is outrageous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5840)|
| 1:37:29| It's outrageous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| But yet, that's leaving 485 people without representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5851)|
| 1:37:38| And when Knox County private attorneys, I call them pro tem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| when they brought this action for a declaratory judgment, the law is completely clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5862)|
| 1:37:49| They have to join every single person whose interest may be affected by that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5869)|
| 1:37:57| That's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| I do serve on the Retirement and Pension Board as well and have for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5883)|
| 1:38:11| If you remember at workshop I spoke to you about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| and how important it is with what you'll decide next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| who you'll have to replace Commissioner Brantley and myself on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5898)|
| 1:38:24| I just want to catch you up with what happened a couple hours earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| We were presented bills for $69,424 for the month of August for legal bills concerning this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5909)|
| 1:38:44| And most of that, really all of it, is protecting the board and the retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5924)|
| 1:38:54| So how much is going to be next month or the month after that or the month after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| I start multiplying this by 12 more months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| And this is retirees' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| I've heard coming out of the general fund, this is coming out of the retirees' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5943)|
| 1:39:09| So I want everybody to be completely aware of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| especially when you make an appointment next month to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| I've got just a couple of questions and just hearing what's going on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| it seems like we've got a court action that the judge is looking at to make a ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5964)|
| 1:39:30| And it seems like there's a problem somewhere in administrating the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5970)|
| 1:39:36| that have been established for the execution of pension funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5976)|
| 1:39:41| Is that correct, Mr. Armstrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| The Chancellor has a question for him as to what the formula is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| to dispense funds for a particular fixed benefit pension fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5990)|
| 1:39:56| or defined benefit pension fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| That's the question before the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| So we're waiting on a decision from the court to tell us what the formula is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6002)|
| 1:40:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| And once we find what the formula is, then we can act accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6010)|
| 1:40:16| The Chancellor will declare some resolution to this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6016)|
| 1:40:20| and whatever that is will be binding upon the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6020)|
| 1:40:25| But we'll have to wait and see what they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| So on the other end of it, what I'm hearing right now is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| we're spending out a ton of money on an attorney's fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| to decide a question that is before the court now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| So if we add one more, that's going to pop that bill back up somewhere along the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6041)|
| 1:40:46| The citizens of Knox County are going to pay for this litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| because that pension board and that goes into the salaries of the people in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6050)|
| 1:40:55| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| Unlike Mr. Monsir's point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| there are several ways that the Chancellor can consider paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| for these class action if he awards one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6063)|
| 1:41:08| And that's the question for the Chancellor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| and that's the question that's before the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| And Mr. Monsir is wanting to get an answer before the judge makes one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6073)|
| 1:41:19| So I don't know what that will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| It's not just could be taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| It could be pensionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| It could be some other potential funding sources for the Chancellor to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6087)|
| 1:41:34| But that's to be in the courtroom, not in a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6094)|
| 1:41:38| Having said that, then, if we go ahead and put this on the agenda right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6098)|
| 1:41:43| then we're adding to the expense of the pension board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6103)|
| 1:41:52| I don't know what you're going to do for an add-on or what your motion is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| so I don't know who it's going to add to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| It could add to the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| It will be an added cost, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| So we're using taxpayers' dollars for that added cost, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| If you appropriate money, it will be taxpayers' dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| If this board appropriates money, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6130)|
| 1:42:16| Commissioner Schoenmacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6137)|
| 1:42:18| I want to ask Captain Carson a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6138)|
| 1:42:31| Is Captain Carson here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6151)|
| 1:42:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6165)|
| 1:42:46| How were you selected over the other 483 members of the UOP to represent them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6166)|
| 1:42:56| It was just a discussion that we were having,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| and there was really no one else at that point to step up and do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6179)|
| 1:43:04| because a lot of the officers don't even realize what's going on with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| and how it's going to affect each and every one of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| And I was just in the best position to step forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| and talk to Mr. Monsier about representing the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6194)|
| 1:43:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6199)|
| 1:43:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6200)|
| 1:43:21| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| Procedurally, I'm just unaware of where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| or how we move forward to address, because these are multiple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6208)|
| 1:43:37| We just have one question before us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| and that's whether we're going to add this to the agenda or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| That's what I wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| And if we're adding this to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| what are we adding amount of money associated with the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6226)|
| 1:43:51| Commissioner Anderson suggested that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6231)|
| 1:43:52| but I think the real issue is that it may not be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| That's what I wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| I mean, just one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6240)|
| 1:44:04| We've kind of got two court dates here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| You've got a hearing, and just to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| we've got a hearing coming up in September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| where the judge is going to be ruling on do we put together a class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6253)|
| 1:44:21| I wanted to make sure it's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| They're not going to be discussing the merits of the case either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| The discussion is really there's been injunctions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| there's been a motion to, frankly, throw it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| and then there's the discussion about the different classes involved in the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| That's what is due to happen in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| The November date on Veterans Day is the date that we've actually asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| for the trial to take place for this declaratory judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6287)|
| 1:44:53| My take on it, frankly, this has come to us really kind of at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6293)|
| 1:45:00| Just to call it what it is, Mr. Monsier, it's really kind of come to us quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| If I could wave a magic wand, if the judge said this is a class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6304)|
| 1:45:10| I would almost think does the pension board say do you propose to move it back another month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6310)|
| 1:45:17| to have us a chance to kind of for all sides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| Because, I mean, frankly, if you found that this class thing happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| that would be a change for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| I would almost rather push the date back a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| just so that both sides can figure out what they want to do moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6331)|
| 1:45:36| I would also give the judge time if he makes a decision on funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| to kind of try to help tie us in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| Because when you look at, I guess, was it Rule 23, putting together a class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6342)|
| 1:45:47| that's something to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| That's my take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| Not a lawyer, but I'm just trying to figure out what might be the most methodological.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6353)|
| 1:45:58| You'd rather just see determination followed by a process after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6358)|
| 1:46:08| I'm inclined to wait and see what happens on the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6368)|
| 1:46:12| I have full faith in a judge that if he's going to create a class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6372)|
| 1:46:15| he would not dismiss the people, especially knowing that this is a governmental issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6375)|
| 1:46:21| and that Knox County, if he feels the charter should be responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6381)|
| 1:46:27| or the pension board should be responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| that he would allow us the opportunity to come back and pass something in support of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6390)|
| 1:46:36| But at this time, I'm kind of inclined to just wait and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6396)|
| 1:46:41| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6401)|
| 1:46:42| Well, I think we've thrown a lot of things out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| We're talking about taxpayer money and pensioners' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| Half the money in the pension is taxpayer money because they put it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6409)|
| 1:46:53| They match 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| Not in the UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6415)|
| 1:46:56| Not in the UOP. There's no match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| No, it's a lot more county money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| Right, it's a lot more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| And then we're paying a private attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| The county's paying taxpayer dollars to bring the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| So let's not talk about using taxpayer money to defend the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| We're paying taxpayer dollars to sue ourselves, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6431)|
| 1:47:16| And so I don't think it's fair for the taxpayers to sue the workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6436)|
| 1:47:21| and the workers be slept out in the cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| I'm really concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6443)|
| 1:47:25| And I don't know the legalities of all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6445)|
| 1:47:29| and I don't like voting for things that are weak, fresh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6449)|
| 1:47:34| But I'm certainly throwing these terms out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6454)|
| 1:47:36| like these employees are wasting taxpayer dollars with this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| This lawsuit was brought by taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| So we've just got to be careful with what we throw out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| And I don't know what the resolution is tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| I support paying for them as I did the last time we voted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| and I won't change my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| But to say that we're wasting taxpayer dollars for these officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6477)|
| 1:48:02| to be defending, we're suing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6482)|
| 1:48:06| So, I mean, that's essentially what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| So we're suing ourselves, and our employees are in the balance on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| So I would like for us to move forward and find a way to make that payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6492)|
| 1:48:17| And if we can't do it tonight, I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| It makes me a little nervous to open the checkbook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| because it's an open-ended check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| That's my only concern, it's an open-ended check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| But let's not fool ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| The only people getting rich here are the attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6510)|
| 1:48:33| So that's essentially what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6513)|
| 1:48:36| Yeah, this is no fault of the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| It's no fault of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| Somehow we have wound up in the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| The law department, the pension board, and the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| are sitting in a triangle throwing rocks at each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| and somehow the taxpayer, the pensioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| and we have got caught up in the middle trying to deflect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6531)|
| 1:48:56| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6536)|
| 1:48:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| I was wondering, okay, and I agree with what Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6539)|
| 1:49:03| and what everyone has said tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6543)|
| 1:49:08| If we go until September 7th to the court date to hear from what Chancellor Weaver rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6548)|
| 1:49:18| then, I mean, instead of having to vote on something, you know, tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6558)|
| 1:49:23| can we not call a special call meeting and then address this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6563)|
| 1:49:30| rather than trying to make a decision tonight on something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6570)|
| 1:49:34| We don't really know what Chancellor Weaver's decision was or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6574)|
| 1:49:40| So I'm just thinking, rather than waiting, if we can wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6580)|
| 1:49:45| and then do a special call meeting if we have to meet to vote or decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6585)|
| 1:49:51| I think we could even do an emergency meeting or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| I mean, that's my suggestion for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6595)|
| 1:49:59| Commissioner Buster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| It seems like we're going to jump into something we really don't know that much about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6601)|
| 1:50:05| and from what I hear, we're going to be spending money that we shouldn't be spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| until after that 7th date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| So do we have a motion on the floor or anything about this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6613)|
| 1:50:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| Does anybody wish to make one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| I want to make one, but you don't know what the cost is, and so you can't put anything on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6626)|
| 1:50:31| I want to make them in support of the employees because I think they're being wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6631)|
| 1:50:35| but you can't open that checkbook and you don't know where it's going to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| It could go to the Supreme Court and we'd be broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| So we're suing ourselves and we could be broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| Think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| Can I make a motion that after we hear from Chancellor Weber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6649)|
| 1:50:54| that we can call an emergency meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6654)|
| 1:50:58| I don't think you need a motion for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| No, we're at the add portion of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6660)|
| 1:51:04| This is either an add or if there's no motion to add it, we're moving on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6664)|
| 1:51:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6670)|
| 1:51:13| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6673)|
| 1:51:18| No, we're still on setting the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6678)|
| 1:51:23| I have one item to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| That's number 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6685)|
| 1:51:26| Do I have a motion and a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6688)|

| 1:51:32| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| I have three items to be deferred to September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6693)|

| 1:51:40| Were you aware of 43?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6702)|

| 1:51:45| Herban, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| What are we deferring them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| 38, 42, and 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6711)|

| 1:52:14| I know I was a little out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6734)|
| 1:52:15| Let me go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| 11, 12, 37, 44, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6736)|
| 1:52:23| And I'd like to move item number 47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| That is our softball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| Softball, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| Softball team up to be heard first under general county resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6754)|

| 1:52:48| They've been here too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6768)|
| 1:52:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| They could get credit for a government class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| One credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6774)|
| 1:52:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6775)|
| 1:52:56| We'll go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6776)|
| 1:52:57| We'll move it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6777)|
| 1:52:58| I didn't want to get it out of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| We've been here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| They have suffered enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6782)|

| 1:53:08| I've noticed we've got a lot of Boy Scouts here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| At some point I think we should recognize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6790)|

| 1:56:16| I was going into another county south of us here, I think it's called Blount County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6976)|
| 1:56:21| and they had these signs all over the place about state champions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| Well, these girls worked hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6985)|

| 1:56:37| Now, the grades are better, they work hard together, and they learn how to work as a team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=6997)|
| 1:56:43| and they know how to handle diversity in this type of sport that they're in because they run into it all the time where somebody gets hurt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7003)|
| 1:56:50| they have to take their place, and they learn all these good social skills, and they don't always get trophies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7010)|
| 1:56:58| but they did get a trophy this time as being state champions, and this is your all's sign that's going to be put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7018)|

| 2:08:16| Yes, sir, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7696)|
| 2:08:17| Well, unless Mr. Underwood, he only had five minutes there, he wouldn't speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7697)|
| 2:08:22| Very briefly, commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7702)|
| 2:08:30| You can tell you've been here too many times when you know how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7710)|
| 2:08:32| I was trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7712)|
| 2:08:37| Here to speak on the Twin Creek Road situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7717)|
| 2:08:41| Story being there was a problem over in south Knoxville, a lot of dumping was going on, hundreds of tires, mattresses, even a big entertainment TV, and the county commissioner for that district was rightfully very concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7721)|
| 2:08:59| What the county commission did was you closed the road, but what you also did was you pumped the brakes to give an opportunity to try to find a solution that would work for everybody involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7739)|
| 2:09:13| After we were here before, there were a number of meetings with the county officials, Mr. Vandermate, Mr. Snowden, all of the Knox County engineering people involved, and even the Knox County mayor got a representative into the meeting, and of course the county commissioner was present as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7753)|
| 2:09:37| Where I think we are, what you have before you is a proposal with solutions that would remedy the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7777)|
| 2:09:48| It involves responsibilities on behalf of the church as well as responsibilities for the county with safeguards in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7788)|
| 2:09:59| We are hopeful that this will be satisfactory to you, and we are hopeful because we ended up with a memorandum of understanding, and we're asking you to approve this MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7799)|
| 2:10:14| We'll find out here in a couple of minutes if it's acceptable to you. We hope that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7814)|
| 2:10:20| Let me just close by saying I know with the rules you prefer not to identify commissioners by name, but if I could say your name, I would say, Councilman Daly, thank you very much for meeting with us and for having an open mind in that process and helping us craft what we believe is a solution to the concerns that you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7820)|
| 2:10:47| Again, without calling individual names, we would say, Commissioner Daly, Commissioner Gill, you have been extraordinary in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7847)|
| 2:11:03| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| And all the commissioners, because it took all of you in order for us to get to this place right here, because you slowed the process down and you gave an opportunity to try to craft a solution, and we're hopeful that we have a satisfactory solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7865)|
| 2:11:21| Again, thank you very much for what you do and for helping with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7881)|
| 2:11:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7886)|
| 2:11:27| Mr. Underwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7887)|
| 2:11:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7888)|
| 2:11:29| Thank you, and I want to thank the church for having the meeting with Dwight Vanderbate, Solid Waste and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7889)|
| 2:11:37| Just to be clear that we know that for the commissioners, the road will stay closed until Knox County cleans up the dump site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7897)|
| 2:11:45| The church will build the fence, and then the road will be opened, and then the church is responsible for keeping that stretch of road clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7905)|
| 2:11:54| And if I could add, Commissioner, they're going to erect a fence, a 12-foot fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7914)|
| 2:11:59| They're going to monitor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7919)|
| 2:12:00| There's a mechanism in where they have to monitor it, and that's a great mechanism, because they're going to monitor it on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7920)|
| 2:12:06| And if they see something, because that was the problem before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7926)|
| 2:12:09| Before years passed and there was this condition that nobody really caught, but with this mechanism to monitor it on a monthly basis, and then there's an obligation on behalf of the church that if there's a problem, you've got to alert the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7929)|
| 2:12:22| And if it needs to be repaired, the church has got to repair it within two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7942)|
| 2:12:27| And so there are safeguards in place to eliminate the concern that got us here in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7947)|
| 2:12:33| But again, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7955)|

| 2:12:47| I'm looking forward to making – hopefully that we can close this dump, and I mean it is terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7967)|
| 2:12:58| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7978)|

| 2:13:08| Is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7988)|
| 2:13:09| Yes, sir, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7989)|
| 2:13:10| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7990)|
| 2:13:11| They have to do monitoring as per the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7991)|
| 2:13:15| Okay, but not Knox County monitoring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7997)|
| 2:13:18| That's why I was getting a little conflicting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=7998)|
| 2:13:21| And are there going to be signs saying anything there in regard to illegal dumping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8001)|
| 2:13:28| There are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8008)|
| 2:13:29| We've worked with the church representatives, and we'll mount signs periodically along the fence advising of the ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8009)|
| 2:13:36| and the requirements of the no dumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8016)|
| 2:13:38| All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8018)|
| 2:13:40| Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| And the church is well aware that any future cleanup costs that are associated with this site will be borne by them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8022)|
| 2:13:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8028)|
| 2:13:49| That is very well specified by Daniel Sanders in the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8029)|
| 2:13:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| We have a motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8037)|
| 2:14:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8040)|
| 2:14:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8041)|
| 2:14:02| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8042)|
| 2:14:03| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8043)|
| 2:14:09| I want to run ahead and do 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| Then after that, I'm going to take a recess, go into zoning, because after 44,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8051)|
| 2:14:19| most of the items only pertain to us as a commission and one other item that is, I call it governmental affair anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8059)|
| 2:14:29| Item 44 is resolution 803 is designating, committing, and appropriating funds in the total amount of $6,023,770.26| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8069)|

| 2:14:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8088)|
| 2:14:49| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| I'd like to ask or give Dr. Frazier an opportunity, if he wanted to, to come up and speak a bit on the rescue squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8091)|
| 2:14:57| I think he had something he wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8097)|
| 2:15:01| I mean, the list looks great to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| He just wanted that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8106)|
| 2:15:07| My name is Russ Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8107)|
| 2:15:08| I'm chief of the Non-Volunteer Rescue Squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8108)|
| 2:15:11| I apologize for not being able to be here last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8111)|
| 2:15:14| Can you give us the address of the rescue squad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8114)|
| 2:15:16| 512 North Chill Howie Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8116)|
| 2:15:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8118)|
| 2:15:20| The rescue squad is an essential service within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8120)|
| 2:15:24| For over 60 years, KBRS has provided exceptional rescue services to the citizens and visitors of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8124)|
| 2:15:32| Over the years, the importance of and the dependency on our services has grown exponentially, causing a need for increased funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8132)|
| 2:15:41| As the only emergency response agency in Knox County that provides the range and level of technical services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8141)|
| 2:15:48| with an inventory of specialized equipment not available through any other Knox County agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8148)|
| 2:15:54| KBRS responds to emergency calls countywide 24 hours a day, seven days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8154)|
| 2:16:00| We serve Knox County with specialized rescue teams in the areas of vehicle rescue, cave and vertical rescue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8160)|
| 2:16:07| high angle rescue, water rescue, confined space, trench collapse, structural collapse, and heavy rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8167)|
| 2:16:15| Our increased population and service provision expansion has triggered the cost to provide the level of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8175)|
| 2:16:22| that Knox County has come to expect, obviously, to rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8182)|
| 2:16:26| In 2017, KBRS's total operating expenditures reached over $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8186)|
| 2:16:33| This is after expenses were addressed by closing two stations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8193)|
| 2:16:37| and transitioning our full-time administrative staff to part-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8197)|
| 2:16:42| Our community outreach team has spent a great deal of time evaluating the best fundraising practices for KBRS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8202)|
| 2:16:48| and has been faced with many obstacles, the biggest being the perception that emergency rescue is a tax-based service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8208)|
| 2:16:56| Nearly $100,000 was submitted to local grants this past year with a mere $8,000 return received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8216)|
| 2:17:05| Feedback from those foundations suggested that we pursue funding from local government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8225)|
| 2:17:09| as this should not be a private sector funding designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8229)|
| 2:17:13| With the county's expectations increasing, funding issues are constant, and volunteer numbers decreasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8233)|
| 2:17:19| KBRS has sought the collaboration of other agencies to ensure that the level of services provided would not be disrupted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8239)|
| 2:17:26| We have formed a personnel agreement with the rural metro fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| to ensure that all emergency response vehicles are staffed with both paid and volunteer rescue professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8249)|
| 2:17:35| We've recently formed an agreement with fleet services to maintain and repair all emergency rescue vehicles at a discounted rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8255)|
| 2:17:43| Providing funding to the Knoxville Volunteer Emergency Rescue Squad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8263)|
| 2:17:47| will ensure the current delivery of rescue services and afford us to meet other agency needs for rescue equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8267)|
| 2:17:53| station repairs and improvements, protective equipment, additional training, uniforms, and volunteer recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8273)|
| 2:17:59| We know that we are a tremendous value to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8279)|
| 2:18:04| We are a present and necessary emergency response service that's there for our citizens in their most critical hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8284)|
| 2:18:11| We strongly believe that KBRS serves its community in a vital capacity and should be a primary funding consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8291)|
| 2:18:18| I'd like to thank Mayor Burchett, Finance Director Chris Caldwell, and of course the Commission for their continued support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8298)|
| 2:18:24| It's much appreciated and very much needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8304)|
| 2:18:27| We're proud to be the primary emergency rescue response agency for every district within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8307)|
| 2:18:34| I feel like we do have a long way to go and I ask that the Commission keep us a priority for future funding considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8314)|
| 2:18:43| I'm one person representing over 100 men and women that miss family occasions, holidays, birthdays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8323)|
| 2:18:50| that are out there free of service volunteering their time to take care of the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8330)|
| 2:18:56| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8338)|
| 2:19:04| Do we have a motion to approve and a second? All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8344)|
| 2:19:10| Say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8350)|
| 2:19:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8351)|
| 2:19:12| Say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8352)|
| 2:19:14| At this point we are supposed to go to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8354)|
| 2:19:17| We have, I believe, six items left on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8357)|
| 2:19:20| I want to put us, will you all give me feedback if you want to do this, put us in recess for commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8360)|
| 2:19:26| and then go to zoning, open up zoning, and then take a 10-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8366)|
| 2:19:31| Yep. Yep. 7-15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8371)|
| 2:19:34| Okay. So, Knox County Commission's in recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8374)|
| 2:19:41| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8381)|
| 2:19:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8382)|
| 2:19:43| I'd like to recognize Janice Toker and former MPs Commissioner Laura Cole are in the audience today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8383)|
| 2:19:50| I don't know why they're here for, but it must not have had nothing to do tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8390)|
| 2:19:54| Madam Clerk, will you read the roll call for zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8394)|

| 2:21:14| I recommend that the Knox County Commission do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8474)|
| 2:21:16| The Commission found that the extension of the Neighborhood Commercial as shown on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8476)|
| 2:21:21| map, recommendation map, would be in keeping with the character of the community and would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8481)|
| 2:21:26| protect the adjacent residential area while allowing the commercial uses of the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8486)|

| 2:21:36| Does the applicant wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8496)|

| 2:22:33| The Metropolitan Planning Commission, by a vote of 15-0, recommends that the Knox County Commission approve the C.N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8553)|

| 2:22:47| The C.N. zoning will allow reasonable use of the front portion of the site for commercial uses while maintaining the rear of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8567)|
| 2:22:54| as office business zoning, which is more compatible with the adjacent residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8574)|
| 2:23:01| Would you wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8581)|
| 2:23:07| I make a motion to approve per MPC recommendation C.N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8587)|

| 2:23:24| 5-A-18-UR is a request of Blue Water Industries, LLC, for approval of plan of operations for expansion of existing mining and mineral extraction operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8604)|
| 2:23:35| The property is located south side of Thorn Grove Pike, west side of Flauver Lane in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8615)|
| 2:23:41| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8621)|
| 2:23:45| Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8625)|
| 2:23:46| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8626)|
| 2:23:50| I am here on behalf of the applicant with other people I'll introduce in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8630)|
| 2:23:56| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8636)|
| 2:24:02| May we get the report of the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8642)|
| 2:24:04| Thank you, Chairman Smith, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8644)|
| 2:24:07| The Metropolitan Planning Commission recommended by a vote of 13-0 that the Commission approve the request for Phase I only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8647)|
| 2:24:15| for the expansion of the existing surface mining and mineral extraction operation as shown on the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8655)|
| 2:24:20| and as described in the mining plan of operations subject to 15 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8660)|
| 2:24:25| These conditions were designed to allow the first phase of the proposed mining operation to be undertaken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8665)|
| 2:24:32| while protecting the adjacent neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8672)|
| 2:24:34| They speak largely to revegetation of the berms, maintenance of the berms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8674)|
| 2:24:39| and other operations that would protect the adjacent residential uses from the mining operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8679)|
| 2:24:44| I'll briefly summarize the more pertinent conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8684)|
| 2:24:49| I won't read all 15, but again, just the summary of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8689)|
| 2:24:54| First one is Phase II of the future mining operation shall not be considered for approval by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8694)|
| 2:25:03| until the revegetation plan has been completed according to Attachment A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8703)|
| 2:25:09| Second one of the phases, I, II, and III rock over berms can be created as part of the Phase I mining expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8709)|
| 2:25:16| but shall only be allowed after the required landscape screening as proposed in Article IV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8716)|
| 2:25:22| Number three, no landscape screening required by Article IV shall be removed unless replaced in kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8722)|
| 2:25:29| or to otherwise meet those screening requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8729)|
| 2:25:32| Condition four, meeting the required 100-foot setback for the deposition of overburden on a spoiled bank rock berm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8732)|
| 2:25:42| or stockpile in the agricultural zone and obtaining approval from the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8742)|
| 2:25:47| to reduce the setback for the existing rock berms along East Governor John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8747)|
| 2:25:52| Asbury Road, and Thorn Grove Pike to no less than the existing condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8752)|
| 2:25:57| Number five, no new or existing berm shall exceed the building height restrictions of the State of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8757)|
| 2:26:03| Scenic Highway System Act of 1971.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8763)|
| 2:26:06| Number six, no new berm shall exceed 35 feet in height within 500 feet of a residential dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8766)|
| 2:26:13| that is not owned by the mine owner with the exception of the Phase I berm at the corner of Thorn Grove Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8773)|
| 2:26:19| and Brook Brooks Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8779)|
| 2:26:23| And number 12, all traffic involved in the sales and distribution of the stone produced on this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8783)|
| 2:26:28| shall be blocked using the existing driveways on the west side of East Governor John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8788)|
| 2:26:34| Again, these conditions were designed to protect adjacent residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8794)|
| 2:26:38| while allowing the continued operation of the mining operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8798)|
| 2:26:43| I'd be happy to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8803)|
| 2:26:47| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8807)|
| 2:26:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8808)|
| 2:26:50| In the descriptions that you read, sometimes you said 15 items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8810)|
| 2:26:57| Are there actually 16 items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| There are 15, and there was a typo on the summary report, but there are 15 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8819)|
| 2:27:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8825)|
| 2:27:06| And these are conditions to be met before any actual continuation of work expansion takes place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8826)|
| 2:27:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8833)|
| 2:27:14| Some of that will be work, the remediation, revegetation of the rock berm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8834)|
| 2:27:20| There will be some activity going on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8840)|
| 2:27:22| but it's largely limited to those items that will protect the neighbors from the existing mining operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8842)|
| 2:27:31| Would the applicant wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8851)|
| 2:27:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8858)|
| 2:27:39| Do you want me to proceed now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8859)|
| 2:27:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8861)|
| 2:27:42| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8862)|
| 2:27:47| I am here on behalf of the applicant along with Walt Hillis, our environmental manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8867)|
| 2:27:54| Corey Thibodeau, the plant manager at Forks of the River Quarry, Scott Nix, our area manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8874)|
| 2:28:01| and Jeff Farrell, who is the general manager and vice president of the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8881)|
| 2:28:06| And we would ask for approval pursuant to the MPC recommendation with the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8886)|
| 2:28:13| By way of history, this quarry was opened in 1972 by American Limestone Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8893)|
| 2:28:21| The first pit was, I say, on the west side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8901)|
| 2:28:25| I think that's what Mr. Green said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8905)|
| 2:28:28| And a plant was opened there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8908)|
| 2:28:31| That part is now used only for crushing operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8911)|
| 2:28:35| The active mining operation is on the east side of John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8915)|
| 2:28:40| In 1977, Knox County approved the expansion to the east side of John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8920)|
| 2:28:51| In 2003, approvals were granted for the expansion of this area, and that is the primary mining area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8931)|
| 2:29:02| The stone is conveyed across John Sevier to the west side where it is crushed, processed, and sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8942)|
| 2:29:14| As Mr. Green mentioned, MPC recommended that we withhold phase two of this expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8954)|
| 2:29:21| until we've completed phase one, and our client is happy to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8961)|
| 2:29:27| and is working on conformity with the conditions enumerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8967)|
| 2:29:34| We have submitted to MPC, which I think is part of your packet, a narrative showing how we will comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8974)|
| 2:29:45| Let me explain a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| Knox County or any civilization today and in the past requires stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8987)|
| 2:29:54| The Egyptians required stone, the Greeks, the Romans, and certainly the U.S. and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=8994)|
| 2:30:01| There are five quarries in Knox County today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9001)|
| 2:30:04| Our client operates one at Raccoon Valley Road at 75, they operate one at Mascot, and this one at Forks of the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9004)|
| 2:30:13| Vulcan has one at Watt Road, and they have one at Riverside Drive, just almost adjacent to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9013)|
| 2:30:22| For many years the policy of the MPC has been that these quarries need to be allowed to expand in a reasonable and responsible manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9022)|
| 2:30:35| There's probably not going to be another quarry open in Knox County in our lifetime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9035)|
| 2:30:40| and I have personally done work on that at the request of clients to evaluate other sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9040)|
| 2:30:46| and evaluate the possibility of having those approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9046)|
| 2:30:51| And I have determined that even though the stone may be present because of lack of infrastructure, roads, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9051)|
| 2:30:59| those sites would probably not be approved by the MPC and this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9059)|
| 2:31:06| As I mentioned, without stone we can't build roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9066)|
| 2:31:09| We couldn't build this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9069)|
| 2:31:11| We couldn't build sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9071)|
| 2:31:13| We couldn't build homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9073)|
| 2:31:15| We could not continue life as we know it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9075)|
| 2:31:19| It seems like a very basic product, but it is essential for modern civilization and all civilizations in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9079)|
| 2:31:29| We are a heavily regulated industry, and Mr. Hillis will go into this in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9089)|
| 2:31:35| We're regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9095)|
| 2:31:36| Blasting is done by a contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9096)|
| 2:31:39| We hire specialists to do the blasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9099)|
| 2:31:42| They are regulated by the state fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9102)|
| 2:31:47| They are regulated or complaints about them also should go to the local fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9107)|
| 2:31:53| Water handling at the site is regulated by TDEC, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9113)|
| 2:32:01| and requires an extensive permit, which this area has been permitted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9121)|
| 2:32:08| The Knox County Air Pollution Control Board regulates air emissions, and they test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9128)|
| 2:32:15| All of these agencies test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9135)|
| 2:32:17| And Knox County in the engineering department regulates them to ensure compliance with Knox County regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9137)|
| 2:32:28| which are extensive for a stone extraction industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9148)|
| 2:32:34| We submit that we meet all of the requirements that Knox County has laid out for this expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9154)|
| 2:32:42| and this is an expansion, not a new quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9162)|
| 2:32:45| And if we do not, we would appreciate being shown where we do not, and our client fully intends to comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9165)|
| 2:32:55| If I may, I'll have Mr. Hillis speak now on the environmental issues and other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9175)|
| 2:33:04| Hello, my name is Walt Hillis, the environmental manager for Blue Water Industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9184)|
| 2:33:08| I live at 2320 Brighton Farms Boulevard in Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9188)|
| 2:33:13| Mr. Seymour gave a little bit of a history of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9193)|
| 2:33:15| I may repeat a couple of the things, but I'm going to talk about the site, the history site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9195)|
| 2:33:20| I'm going to talk about our current compliance with our environmental permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9200)|
| 2:33:24| and I'm going to talk about some things that were brought up at the MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9204)|
| 2:33:29| and then following meetings with the neighbors and the community and what we've done on site in response to all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9209)|
| 2:33:35| As Mr. Seymour said, this site has been a quarry for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9215)|
| 2:33:39| The original quarries in this community in Marbledale actually started back in the 1870s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9219)|
| 2:33:44| and the marble industry ran through the Great Depression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9224)|
| 2:33:47| and then American Limestone, as previously been stated, came in in the early 70s and 72| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9227)|
| 2:33:54| and opened up on the west side of John Sevier, what we call Pits 1 and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9234)|
| 2:33:58| And then in 77, they went through the process and added land on the other side of John Sevier on the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9238)|
| 2:34:06| and that became the area that is now known as Pit 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9246)|
| 2:34:09| And then the final part up until this date in 2003, the owner at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9249)|
| 2:34:14| Rinker Materials, who followed American Limestone, they added some more acreage over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9254)|
| 2:34:19| So Pit 3 has been active since 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9259)|
| 2:34:23| At this site, we are regulated by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9263)|
| 2:34:27| the Division of Water Resources Mining Section, and we have our NPDES permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9267)|
| 2:34:32| That's how they regulate us, on a water permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9272)|
| 2:34:34| And then we are regulated through the Health Department in Knox County by the Air Quality Division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9274)|
| 2:34:39| We have those permits. We're in compliance with our permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9279)|
| 2:34:42| I started with the predecessor to Blue Water in 08, and I'm not aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9282)|
| 2:34:48| There's been no violations of any of our permits, any NOVs issued since I've been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9288)|
| 2:34:53| and I checked the historical records that I inherited, and I can't find any for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9293)|
| 2:34:58| We get inspected twice a year by Knox County Air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9298)|
| 2:35:02| One is announced, one is unannounced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9302)|
| 2:35:04| And then we get inspected periodically by the TDEC water folks on our NPDES permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9304)|
| 2:35:09| and right now that's averaging every eight to nine months, about two times every 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9309)|
| 2:35:15| Some things that went on at the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9315)|
| 2:35:20| They asked us to, number one, they added the condition for the plantings, as has been mentioned, on our berms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9320)|
| 2:35:30| and they asked us to work with the French Broad Preservation Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9330)|
| 2:35:33| working on native plantings and type of grasses and trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9333)|
| 2:35:36| And then they asked us to start a dialogue with the neighbors, our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9336)|
| 2:35:41| And as a result of that, I've been working with the French Broad on the plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9341)|
| 2:35:46| I have my landscaper and my plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9346)|
| 2:35:49| I have my hydroseeding man for my grasses and my flowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9349)|
| 2:35:53| And then in meeting with the community, we first met with some representatives from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9353)|
| 2:35:58| and the French Broad Preservation Association in July, I think July 12th, met at the quarry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9358)|
| 2:36:04| laid the foundation for a big community-wide meeting we had on the 6th of August at Marbledale Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9364)|
| 2:36:10| And then we had a follow-up to my landscape plan and the revegetation that's being required by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9370)|
| 2:36:16| Last week, on the 22nd, at the quarry with some of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9376)|
| 2:36:19| And as a result of the meeting at Marbledale Baptist, where we had a big number of the neighbors there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9379)|
| 2:36:25| it seemed to us that the biggest concerns was the berm, both visually and being it vegetated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9385)|
| 2:36:33| which was required by MPC, and how high it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9393)|
| 2:36:37| And since that meeting, and I've talked to a couple of the neighbors and they've seen it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9397)|
| 2:36:41| we have started a program where we are lowering the berm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9401)|
| 2:36:44| The berm is coming down anywhere an average 15 to 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9404)|
| 2:36:49| It's going to be shorter, wider, and flatter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9409)|
| 2:36:52| It'll be level across the top pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9412)|
| 2:36:54| Right now, it's got some humps in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9414)|
| 2:36:56| So it'll be easier to get up there and maintain and hydroseed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9416)|
| 2:36:59| So we're bringing it down. I've got my landscaping plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9419)|
| 2:37:02| I've got my seeding plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9422)|
| 2:37:04| And just waiting for the right time this fall and this winter to get my grasses in and my trees in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9424)|
| 2:37:10| And we'll be good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9430)|
| 2:37:13| And that's about all I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9433)|
| 2:37:15| Are there any questions for me on anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9435)|
| 2:37:18| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9438)|
| 2:37:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9439)|
| 2:37:21| You and I had a meeting at the quarry with Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9441)|
| 2:37:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9445)|
| 2:37:26| You know, one of my concerns, I don't remember if I expressed it that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9446)|
| 2:37:29| right across the river is the Veterans Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9449)|
| 2:37:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9452)|
| 2:37:34| How big of a buffer are you leaving from the bluff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9454)|
| 2:37:40| We will never see, hopefully we'll never see any of the quarry from down below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9460)|
| 2:37:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9466)|
| 2:37:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9467)|
| 2:37:48| That came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9468)|
| 2:37:49| The Veterans Cemetery, we have a good working relationship with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9469)|
| 2:37:53| Before we blast, they know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9473)|
| 2:37:55| We make sure there's no ceremonies going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9475)|
| 2:37:57| Everything is a good relationship there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9477)|
| 2:38:01| We will not, you will not be able to see the berm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9481)|
| 2:38:05| the part of phase one berm that was approved by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9485)|
| 2:38:09| You know, it has the current height restriction on it from MPC of 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9489)|
| 2:38:13| Whether it's 35 feet or 15 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9493)|
| 2:38:16| you will not be able to see the berm above the tree line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9496)|
| 2:38:19| The tree line along the bluff is going to stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9499)|
| 2:38:21| and the folks at the Veterans Cemetery, all they'll see is the tree line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9501)|
| 2:38:25| There will be nothing protruding above it for them to see from the berm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9505)|
| 2:38:28| So, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9508)|
| 2:38:29| You know, it kind of confused me there when we had our meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9509)|
| 2:38:33| and I don't remember the gentleman's name is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9513)|
| 2:38:35| and I don't see him in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9515)|
| 2:38:37| You know, he requested that the berm be lowered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9517)|
| 2:38:40| and that's the first time that you ever heard of a berm wanting to be lowered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9520)|
| 2:38:43| because it will increase the noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9523)|
| 2:38:45| Well, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9525)|
| 2:38:46| I mean, generally people want the berm, our neighbors want it bigger to hide us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9526)|
| 2:38:52| The sound, anything that has to do with the operation, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9532)|
| 2:38:57| we want it higher from a security standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9537)|
| 2:38:59| I mean, if you have a shorter, wider berm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9539)|
| 2:39:02| we do have problems with trespassers on all-terrain vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9542)|
| 2:39:05| It gets to be a nightmare sometimes in some locations, especially in more rural locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9545)|
| 2:39:09| The bigger the berm, the safer it is for people and for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9549)|
| 2:39:12| because, you know, a bigger berm, they can't get over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9552)|
| 2:39:14| They have to do a real effort to walk, and most people are too lazy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9554)|
| 2:39:18| That's true, and I would like to admit, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9558)|
| 2:39:21| if I was there, I think a bigger berm would be better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9561)|
| 2:39:23| but we'll do what MPC and you all agreed to for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9563)|
| 2:39:29| You know, this is Commissioner Wright's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9569)|
| 2:39:33| and this all started because of the John Sevier Corridor Highway Study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9573)|
| 2:39:36| and everything that we had a meeting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9576)|
| 2:39:38| and part of that concern was the way it looked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9578)|
| 2:39:43| and with you agreeing to do the hydro-seeding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9583)|
| 2:39:46| and making it look like a mountain instead of a war zone, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9586)|
| 2:39:51| and, you know, I appreciate you all doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9591)|
| 2:39:53| and I've been through that area for many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9593)|
| 2:39:56| and I've never seen any trouble out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9596)|
| 2:39:58| No violations, no issues with trucks or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9598)|
| 2:40:02| so I just want to make sure that we have that, leave that tree line on the bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9602)|
| 2:40:08| so that when they have funerals, they won't, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9608)|
| 2:40:11| you all don't blast in the funeral times as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9611)|
| 2:40:14| That tree line will be left, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9614)|
| 2:40:15| You will not be able to see over the tree line into our berm or our operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9615)|
| 2:40:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9619)|
| 2:40:20| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9620)|
| 2:40:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9621)|
| 2:40:22| One quick question, I guess, and I'm looking at the map and on KGIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9622)|
| 2:40:26| and so what will the folks at 2921 Fulver Lane, the Fulver family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9626)|
| 2:40:35| what will they be seeing, and I guess it would be far east of what you're trying to rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9635)|
| 2:40:40| or the northern part of the parcel, I guess, but it's 2921 Fulver Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9640)|
| 2:40:47| What will they be seeing from the change that you're making or asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9647)|
| 2:40:53| They shouldn't be seeing anything but the tree line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9653)|
| 2:40:55| because the proposed building of the berm and the extension of the pit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9655)|
| 2:40:59| Phase 2 and Phase 3, that was taken out at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9659)|
| 2:41:03| so there's still going to be an undisturbed tree line that will be facing Fulver Lane there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9663)|
| 2:41:07| so the scenery won't be changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9667)|
| 2:41:12| And how close, have you measured the feet and how close it is from their backyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9672)|
| 2:41:18| or their house to where you'll be blasting and digging?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9678)|
| 2:41:22| Well, by code, in the Knox County Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9682)|
| 2:41:24| we can't have an open pit of blasting and digging operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9684)|
| 2:41:27| any closer than 200 feet to the property line of the occupied residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9687)|
| 2:41:30| Property line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9690)|
| 2:41:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9691)|
| 2:41:32| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9692)|
| 2:41:33| That's what, you were looking at the map on KGIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9693)|
| 2:41:37| the solid black line is the 100 foot of no disturbance in screening whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9697)|
| 2:41:43| The dashed black line is the 200 foot where we were proposing berms until that was taken out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9703)|
| 2:41:49| but then on the inside of the 200 foot can be the pit, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9709)|
| 2:41:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9713)|
| 2:41:54| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9714)|
| 2:41:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9717)|
| 2:41:59| Basically, currently you have about 300 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9719)|
| 2:42:02| and it looks like on the map here that you just purchased six residential tracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9722)|
| 2:42:08| to get another 25 acres, so you'll be up to 325 acres approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9728)|
| 2:42:13| Yes, my NPDES permit with the state encompasses all my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9733)|
| 2:42:17| on both sides of the road and all three pits, and it's 325 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9737)|
| 2:42:22| And the total that we were originally asking for in the Phase 1, 2, and 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9742)|
| 2:42:27| of the original proposal was 25.8 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9747)|
| 2:42:31| If you take out the berms and the expansion of the pit for Phase 2 and 3 that was taken off the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9751)|
| 2:42:36| the area that was being encompassed in the current Phase 1 that's being considered now is right at 13 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9756)|
| 2:42:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9762)|
| 2:42:43| And then of the new parcels that you're acquiring, when would actually operations begin there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9763)|
| 2:42:49| Well, they can't begin because Phase 2 and 3 was taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9769)|
| 2:42:53| We would have to meet the requirements to revegetate the berms along John Sevier and Asbury and Thorn Grove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9773)|
| 2:42:59| and once that's done in place, and that's probably going to take me a couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9779)|
| 2:43:03| a couple of good growing seasons, three or four good growing seasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9783)|
| 2:43:06| At that point, MPC said we can come back and ask for what we originally proposed as Phase 2 and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9786)|
| 2:43:13| But on my hydroseeding and my planting and stuff, it's going to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9793)|
| 2:43:18| we'll do what we do this fall and winter as far as the trees, see what works, what doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9798)|
| 2:43:22| We'll have to adjust, hit it again in the seeding in the spring and then come back in the fall next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9802)|
| 2:43:27| So it's going to be a couple of years before I can get everything vegetated the way it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9807)|
| 2:43:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9813)|
| 2:43:41| I'm Jeff Farrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9821)|
| 2:43:42| I live at 2601 Cherokee Road, Johnson City, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9822)|
| 2:43:45| I'm the general manager for Blue Water East Tennessee, and I want to thank everybody, first off, for hearing our application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9825)|
| 2:43:54| At one of the community meetings we had, some of the commissioners were in attendance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9834)|
| 2:43:58| and they kind of asked me what benefit do we bring to Knox County, so I thought I would cover some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9838)|
| 2:44:04| Blue Water employs 57 employees in what I'm going to call Greater Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9844)|
| 2:44:08| Not all of that's Knox County, but out of those 57 employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9848)|
| 2:44:13| they make an average of $48,770 a year to support families and children and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9853)|
| 2:44:22| As said, we actually have four operations in the county, the three quarries that Arthur mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9862)|
| 2:44:28| and we have one distribution yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9868)|
| 2:44:31| We call it Coster, but it's just a resale yard where we purchase materials and then resell them to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9871)|
| 2:44:37| A lot of landscaping, stone, and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9877)|
| 2:44:41| Also, our East Tennessee corporate office is located in Knox County on Diggs Gap Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9881)|
| 2:44:47| right across from our Raccoon Valley operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9887)|
| 2:44:52| These are 2017 figures. They're the best I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9892)|
| 2:44:55| In 2017, we paid $144,000 in Knox County property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9895)|
| 2:45:01| We collected $894,000 worth of sales and use taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9901)|
| 2:45:05| I know a lot of that's state, but some of that comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9905)|
| 2:45:09| And then we also paid in $295,000 in franchise and excise taxes, which again is state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9909)|
| 2:45:15| but a lot of that comes back to the localities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9915)|
| 2:45:19| We do business with every major contractor around here that builds roads or houses or developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9919)|
| 2:45:26| or structures or whatever like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9926)|
| 2:45:30| I can't put a number on the employees that those businesses support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9930)|
| 2:45:33| but I'm sure it's in the thousands inside of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9933)|
| 2:45:37| Some of our largest customers, Harrison Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9937)|
| 2:45:39| They just finished the resurfacing on I-40, which certainly makes me happy because it needed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9939)|
| 2:45:45| Duracap Asphalt is right around the corner from our quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9945)|

| 2:45:52| Squatchy Concrete is another concrete producer in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9952)|
| 2:45:55| Lamcon Concrete is another ReadyMix producer in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9955)|
| 2:45:59| Blalock's Construction out of Sevier County, but they do an awful lot of work in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9959)|
| 2:46:05| Ross PreStress, they're a pre-stress structures manufacturer that produces beams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9965)|
| 2:46:10| and things of that nature, specialized for bridge construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9970)|
| 2:46:14| and anything where you have to span some void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9974)|
| 2:46:21| Some of the haulers that we do business with that we sell material to and they haul our material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9981)|
| 2:46:28| Walker's Trucking, Claiborne Hauling, Ford Trucking, Whaley Trucking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9988)|
| 2:46:31| these are all your major hauling contractors in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9991)|
| 2:46:36| Some of our major vendors that we do business with and spend an awful lot of money with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=9996)|

| 2:46:51| Holston Gases is where we get all our gases for welding and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10011)|
| 2:46:57| Best One Tire is our tire manufacturer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10017)|
| 2:47:00| These are businesses that operate and employ people in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10020)|
| 2:47:05| Over the past five years, these are rough numbers, but with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10025)|
| 2:47:08| we've provided over $1 million worth of product in the Knox County projects directly with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10028)|
| 2:47:13| With the city, we've provided over $1.5 million worth of product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10033)|
| 2:47:19| These numbers are very conservative because some of it is hard to discern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10039)|
| 2:47:23| And then for TDOT in this district, in the Knox County area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10043)|
| 2:47:27| we've provided well over $10 million worth of product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10047)|
| 2:47:30| to the Tennessee Department of Transportation for multiple projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10050)|
| 2:47:34| Some of the projects were I-40 and Broadway, State Road 33 and Halls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10054)|
| 2:47:39| the Western Avenue expansion, City of Knoxville, Cumberland Avenue streetscapes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10059)|

| 2:48:02| And we're also very cognizant of participating in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10082)|
| 2:48:06| We donate to the following organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10086)|
| 2:48:09| UT is our largest. We donate quite a bit of money to the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10089)|
| 2:48:14| The Children's Cancer Society, the Americans Cancer Society, the Shrine Circus Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10094)|

| 2:48:31| which is a boxing program for young troubled youths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10111)|
| 2:48:34| With that being said, obviously we produce a product that is needed desperately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10114)|
| 2:48:40| As Mr. Seymour said, there's not a lot of opportunity for expansion outside of the existing operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10120)|
| 2:48:47| So hopefully that justifies or answers some of the questions about what our value is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10127)|
| 2:48:52| and what we try to bring to the community. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10132)|
| 2:48:58| Would someone from the opposition wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10138)|
| 2:49:08| Sir, will you be the only one speaking on behalf of your group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10148)|
| 2:49:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10152)|
| 2:49:13| Okay, you have up to 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10153)|
| 2:49:16| My name is Dennis Ford. I live at 5806 Stone Grove Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10156)|
| 2:49:20| One house separates my house and my wife's from Fulver Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10160)|
| 2:49:26| which is where the original Phase 2 and Phase 3 of this petition would come to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10166)|
| 2:49:34| I appreciate the fact that Blue Water is a successful industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10174)|
| 2:49:40| and the list and the litany of their customers only adds to the fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10180)|
| 2:49:46| We citizens, if you're all from Marble Bay, would you raise your hand so they can see who we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10186)|
| 2:49:52| We feel kind of like David and Goliath when we're facing the berms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10192)|
| 2:49:58| and when we're facing the commercialization that's going on in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10198)|
| 2:50:02| and we come before you as the people tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10202)|
| 2:50:05| We need help, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10205)|
| 2:50:08| Yes, all the history is correct about the west side of John Sevier coming across to that side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10208)|
| 2:50:18| and all of that was agricultural land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10218)|
| 2:50:21| And the proposal of two and three of this petition to start out with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10221)|
| 2:50:27| which we are not in opposition by default to Phase 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10227)|
| 2:50:34| because it's a lesser of three evils if you live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10234)|
| 2:50:38| But we are the people that are petitioning you all to make very careful what our position is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10238)|
| 2:50:45| We are adamantly against Phase 2 and Phase 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10245)|
| 2:50:49| And as I hear the conversation coming up tonight, it's setting the stage for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10249)|
| 2:50:55| That's why we wanted the berms to not stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10255)|
| 2:50:58| Commissioner Daley, I appreciate what you said about coming out of the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10258)|
| 2:51:01| That's where I lived for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10261)|
| 2:51:04| When you come across the Governor John Sevier Highway and you go by the cemetery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10264)|
| 2:51:10| and you cross the river, the scenery changes, does it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10270)|
| 2:51:16| And you turn right up Thorngrove Pike and it changes again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10276)|
| 2:51:21| And if you've lived there historically about watching the encroachment of the berms and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10281)|
| 2:51:28| you were afraid to drive down the highway at times because rocks were rolling off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10288)|
| 2:51:32| where they were deposited on the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10292)|
| 2:51:35| It distracts, I'm here to testify, if you're driving down the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10295)|
| 2:51:42| Everything before has been agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10302)|
| 2:51:46| If you'll look on the maps that you have as a parcel of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10306)|
| 2:51:50| the property that you're buying up Fargo Lane now is Sinking Springs Subdivision or Dishon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10310)|
| 2:51:56| It's residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10316)|
| 2:51:59| It's not a farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10319)|
| 2:52:01| It's in Brildon now and expanding a quarry into a residential community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10321)|
| 2:52:08| Commissioner Andrews, you asked about what people would see if they lived on Fargo Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10328)|
| 2:52:15| Well, with Phase I, it's back in the vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10335)|
| 2:52:19| But if they come back, and one of the things I want to make sure that we're understanding tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10339)|
| 2:52:25| is we're voting only on, y'all are voting only on Phase I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10345)|
| 2:52:30| They've got to come back and reapply, reapply for Phase II and Phase III.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10350)|
| 2:52:39| Now, they talked about the state permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10359)|
