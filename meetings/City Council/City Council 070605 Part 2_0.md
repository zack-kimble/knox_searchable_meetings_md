| 0:00:00| district councilman who represents this area is not even in town. And, you know, frankly, we knew that two weeks ago when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=0)|
| 0:00:07| created this 14-day moratorium. So I was concerned about it that evening, thinking that this was not going to be a good result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=7)|
| 0:00:16| He was not here to represent his district or to in any way be involved in this. So that's one big concern I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=16)|
| 0:00:24| The other concern I have is that people seem to have gotten different kinds of information and different kinds of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=24)|
| 0:00:31| explanations and that there has not been an opportunity for a meeting where everyone can sit down with people who do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=31)|
| 0:00:40| answers and do have clarification points, which would be very helpful here and which I think also would be very helpful to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=40)|
| 0:00:47| council. So I don't know how to frame this, but I think another short period of time and council needs to discuss whether it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=47)|
| 0:00:58| going to be a moratorium or whether it's going to be we can't postpone it because then the moratorium goes out of being, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=58)|
| 0:01:09| So, you know, I think we need to discuss it among ourselves how it's a way to resolve this and have a period of time and an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=69)|
| 0:01:17| opportunity, a set short period of time, when these folks who have sat through this entire meeting have an opportunity to get some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=77)|
| 0:01:26| answers and ask their questions and have people available there who are in a position to assist in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=86)|
| 0:01:33| That's what's going on in my mind. Now, how to fix that? I'm not really prepared to propose, but I think we need to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=93)|
| 0:01:41| I would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| Councilman Frost. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=106)|
| 0:01:47| Two weeks ago, when Councilman Hulk brought this to our attention, it was mentioned that there was a contract in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=107)|
| 0:01:57| And my first response to that was that that's a dangerous path to go down to begin to tamper with or to halt a business deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=117)|
| 0:02:08| And, you know, there was a contract in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| And as I look at this and hear that contract that they backed out of it, you know, I'm concerned about exposure, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=132)|
| 0:02:24| me being exposed, the city being exposed, because I could see how we could render that property almost useless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=144)|
| 0:02:32| He says the attorney mentioned that the property owner has potentially been harmed already and that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=152)|
| 0:02:40| he might not get the amount of money that was on the other contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| And that whole process of a government entity stepping in into any sort of business dealing, real estate, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=165)|
| 0:02:55| because of certain council members or certain people's concerns that development might not be done in a way that they would like to see it done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=175)|
| 0:03:07| to me is a little out of, it just concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| And I'm all for trying to find a way to maintain the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| But when it comes to putting a moratorium and stopping a contract, it scares me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=196)|
| 0:03:24| And as mentioned earlier, you know, people have rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| And I don't think that we can step in and begin to change the rules after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=208)|
| 0:03:34| I've heard in my investigation from talking to attorneys and to the NPC that this property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=214)|
| 0:03:42| and those property owners in that area currently have a right to develop their land as it currently exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=222)|
| 0:03:52| And we can't go in there after the fact and change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| So, you know, I can't support the moratorium in any shape, form or fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| I just think it's a dangerous path to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| And I think that, you know, we've worked in other neighborhoods, large neighborhoods with the RE-1 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=244)|
| 0:04:15| which is just the opposite of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| And I think that the NPC can begin to work on some restrictions that everybody can live with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| that are some common sense restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| And, you know, we've worked out these things in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| But as it stands now, the way it was presented to council, I can't continue to support a moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=267)|
| 0:04:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| I'm going to go to Councilman Frost next, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| You know, when council tries to do something, you know, sometimes you make a decision, you get sued on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| Sometimes you don't make a decision, you get sued on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| I don't think anybody on this council is going to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| verbally hang out a neighborhood to drive because somebody's representative is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| So I don't want folks to, you know, think that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| And, you know, you always look to the guidance of the district-specific representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| because they're elected by those folks to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=304)|
| 0:05:10| And Councilman Holquist was twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| But, you know, I've had extensive conversations with Mr. Swanson about, okay, if we pass this moratorium, then what's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=312)|
| 0:05:21| What's our solution and where can we legally go from this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| I'm going to ask him to explain a little bit here in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| But, you know, the unfortunate situation is sometimes you're licked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| And I think we're getting ready to, if you want this moratorium, you know, I'm not going to give you the unvarnished truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=336)|
| 0:05:45| I think you're licked if you want this moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| I'm going to call on Mr. Swanson to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| Well, I think the answer to your question is that last week a group of folks met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=352)|
| 0:06:04| including representatives from the law department, including myself, including Mr. Donaldson from the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=364)|
| 0:06:13| from a number of the city departments to review this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| and see whether there was something out there that would be available that would provide a solution to a perceived problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=378)|
| 0:06:31| It was not our position to determine whether or not the problem actually existed or didn't actually exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=391)|
| 0:06:37| because those are policy issues as to how the property should be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| But just assuming that in someone's mind there was a perception of a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| with regard to the development of these small lots of record here along the waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| was there some way in which to prevent the development of those small lots of record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| assuming the subdivision regulations continue to provide for joint permanent easements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=420)|
| 0:07:09| None of the persons in that meeting was able to come up with any type of zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| or subdivision regulation solution to the issue that made any kind of common sense at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=435)|
| 0:07:25| And certainly nothing that could be done within a limited period of time during which moratoria are authorized by the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=445)|
| 0:07:36| I mean, when you have a moratorium, that moratorium has to be very limited in scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| and you have to have something in mind in terms of studying a problem and reaching a resolution of that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=462)|
| 0:07:51| And I'm not saying that we in that meeting were necessarily the repositories of all knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=471)|
| 0:08:00| with regard to land development or with regard to methods by which this situation might be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=480)|
| 0:08:07| but there was quite a bit of talent in that room who have had a great deal of experience with land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=487)|
| 0:08:16| land development and planning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| And there was really no one in that room who could offer a reasonable resolution to a perceived problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=501)|
| 0:08:32| if it was a problem, if you understand what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| Is that a response to your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| Let me do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| You know, like I said, you know, you need to know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| I'd like to, you know, ask if any of the advocates who spoke in favor of the moratorium to see, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| their thoughts and how we can move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| I mean, you've heard what Mr. Swanson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| How can we get to what you're seeking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| I don't know if that's Mr. Congleton, Ms. Craig or the other speaker whose name I forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=538)|
| 0:09:05| Would anyone, Councilman Frost asked if anybody would like to speak to that directly and maybe just one representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=545)|
| 0:09:13| I wish I knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| I don't know how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| It's all I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| I don't know what the rules are, but it's all I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| Let me add to that real briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| I know this meeting took place and I have great respect for the people who were in the meeting, and I got, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| Councilman Holquist told me about it and gave me the gist of what went on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| and I'm aware that there were no solutions identified in that meeting to the perceived problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=581)|
| 0:09:47| But, you know, I don't, at least for our concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| even such a talented group of people in a two-hour meeting kicking it around just doesn't quite satisfy us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=593)|
| 0:10:00| We'd really like somebody like MPC to take ownership and do some real research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=600)|
| 0:10:07| and not just say we think state law prohibits that, but say state law prohibits that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| It's right here in TCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| Do a thorough job of looking at this and letting everybody understand what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=615)|
| 0:10:22| I don't know if that helps any or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| I want to ask a follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| Mr. Donaldson, what could you accomplish in two weeks' time in determining taking ownership of this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=627)|
| 0:10:36| Well, I could certainly expand the breadth of the experience that has addressed the issue already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=636)|
| 0:10:44| and write up a formal report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| I mean, was counsel for MPC, Steve Wise, involved with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| No, he wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| That would be my first call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| May I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| Actually, you'll need to be recognized by a member of counsel first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| I'll recognize Mr. Hawes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| We have rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| These are being violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| I can't even fix the chimney on my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| Why do we need a moratorium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| We have not violated any law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| Socala hadn't violated any law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| All we have is people who do not live on Spence Place objecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| They're two and three blocks away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| They want to live in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| Show me anything wrong with the Allens house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| How have they been harmed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| They will be helped if they build a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| I can't see that they really have anything to complain about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| I mean, I know there's aesthetic beauty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| I live in an aesthetic beauty, too, and it's paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| But I cannot see why my rights as a property owner and Socala's or anyone else should be violated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=704)|
| 0:11:52| simply because someone wants to live in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| Mr. Donaldson, so in two weeks' time, you think you could convene another meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| and come to some sort of final conclusion on this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| I don't know that it would be final, but it would be a first step towards it perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| I don't know where this is going to go, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| I'm thinking about making a motion to make this another 14-day moratorium to see if anything can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| I'll go ahead and make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| I'll second that motion for the reasons I stated earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| because I think there's just a desperate need for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| And, you know, we are in no position to provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| So for that reason, I'll second that motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| although I understand the concerns about the moratorium that Mr. Bailey has expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=763)|
| 0:12:51| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| Might I suggest to counsel, if you're going to amend the proposed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| to provide for another 14-day moratorium, that you further amend it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| I have heard a problem discussed tonight that we could probably find a solution to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| If you amended it to provide that it only applies to new construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| then at least you wouldn't have the problem with regard to renovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| and repairs and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| And, frankly, if I had thought of it to start with, it would have said that to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| It would have said just a moratorium on new construction as opposed to other construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| So I would ask you to consider that at least as a potential amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| if you're going to proceed with a moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| And I'm not advising you one way or the other to either proceed with a moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| or not proceed with a moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| I'm just saying if you do, you might consider an additional amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| that would provide this as a moratorium only on new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Actually, that was a question when we got to our discussion that I was going to ask Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| because that appears to be something that was overlooked in the original writing of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=831)|
| 0:13:57| Let's make that part of the motion that it would be for 14 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| and would apply only to new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| And I will second that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| Ms. Mitchell, just remind me, we didn't have an original motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| Oh, we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| No, I guess we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| So we would need a motion on the original motion and then the motion to amend if I think I have it all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=852)|
| 0:14:19| I think that's correct, and that was my concern about how to handle this earlier because we were going to have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=859)|
| 0:14:25| Okay, move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| How do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| Ms. Swanson, what do we do with, I guess, the amended motion that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| I guess it's inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| I think it's a nullity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| Nullity because there was no motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| Now that it's been moved, did I hear a second somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| I'll second it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| I'd like to make a motion to amend it to allow for only 14-day moratorium and to apply only to new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=883)|
| 0:14:50| I'll second that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| While I have the greatest deal of respect for all the folks from Island Home who have come down tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| who are looking for a solution to this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| I can't support the extension of this moratorium because I have yet to hear any convincing thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=902)|
| 0:15:11| or logic as to how the government can go in and force a property owner to consolidate their lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=911)|
| 0:15:18| I know the process is called subdivision, but it's a confusing one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| In reality, it means you take the old ward lines and you erase them and you consolidate into one great big lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| And I have yet to hear anything that convinces me that this is an action that is right or proper on the part of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=928)|
| 0:15:38| to go in and tell someone that they must consolidate their lot, redraw their lot lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=938)|
| 0:15:45| And I guess I'm not convinced that any amount of other experts or any amount of time is going to overcome that constitutional right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=945)|
| 0:15:54| to property that these folks own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| So I absolutely cannot support this moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| We'll go to Chris Woodhull and then I'll come back over this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| I actually tend to kind of agree with what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| I am curious to know, Mr. Donaldson, you said you were going to address the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| I don't mean to be dense, but what exactly do you see as the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=973)|
| 0:16:20| To provide clarification as to the rights of those owners of ward map created lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=980)|
| 0:16:29| and to provide clarification as to the authority of folks other than the owner of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=989)|
| 0:16:37| to apply for a subdivision of that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| Rachel, is that what you see as the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1003)|
| 0:16:52| Man, I hate being put on the spot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| And I hope if I go off the tracks that some of my neighbors will yell out there and tell me to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1014)|
| 0:17:01| I see that as part of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| What I'd like to see also included is I know there were discussions the other day about different zoning options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1024)|
| 0:17:13| and different this and that and the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| I'd like it a little broader than what Mr. Donaldson just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| But in essence, yeah, clarify what the existing rights are and then look at any possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1041)|
| 0:17:30| I'm saying solutions because I perceive a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| I realize not everybody may think solutions is the right word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| But look at any possible solutions and, you know, either say that's feasible, that's worth investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:43| that's completely illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| But Mr. Donaldson is more focusing on the property owners and what they can and can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| But your point of view is much more about, I don't know, if you want to call it the neighborhood rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1073)|
| 0:17:59| about the character of the community, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| Yeah, I think what I'm saying is look at what options a neighborhood might have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1081)|
| 0:18:10| in trying to exert some control over its form of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| I guess that's a good way to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| And there may be none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| But let's look at it carefully before we decide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| First off, we kind of got off on the wrong foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| or it felt like we got off on the wrong foot by the public notice or Mr. Sakala.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1104)|
| 0:18:33| And actually I've heard your name pronounced two different ways this evening, so I'll go with Sakala.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| Would that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| You were not aware of the kind of discussion we were having the last two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| I'd like for you to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1132)|
| 0:19:03| My name is Carter, K-H-A-D-E-R, Sakala, S-A-K-A-L-L-A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| And I wanted to thank you first for allowing me to come here and speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| because I didn't have that chance in the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| All this discussion can be resolved very easily had my neighbors decided to be neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1159)|
| 0:19:26| and ask me what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| Up to this date, nobody come to me and ask me what I was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| To this day, not even my city councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| So we can resolve all these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| We heard from experts that they cannot force me to make one lot out of three lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| which I'm not going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| They're worried about the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| The character of the neighborhood is mixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| There is no architectural uniformity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| The age of the houses in the neighborhood ranges from 80 years to 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| So it's not historical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| I looked in the Knoxville News Central article the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| It is not one of the critically endangered neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1210)|
| 0:20:19| So where is the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| To me, if there is a problem, somebody needs to tell me, here's a problem, solve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| Right now, nobody told me what the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| All I hear is chatter from all my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| I had people coming to my yard, measuring my yard in the back, trespassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| Yet they did not call me or knock on my door to ask me what I was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| This is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| And I think passing a moratorium when I'm not present to defend myself is wrong too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1243)|
| 0:20:52| And I just heard that because Mr. Holquist is not here, we should give him the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1252)|
| 0:20:59| He knew about this date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| Yet he passed the moratorium against me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| That's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| I bought the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| It's my right to build on it whatever I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| But having said all that, if my neighbors want to talk to me, I will tell them what my plans are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1272)|
| 0:21:19| which is not what they're hearing or what they're thinking or what they're dreaming at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| My plan is to put one or two houses that will complement the neighborhood with one driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1285)|
| 0:21:32| It will be no different from any other house in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| So far, that's all I heard is the concern about the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| That's the solution for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| Talk to me. I'll tell you what I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| And leave it out of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| It is not the government business to tell people what to do with their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| I'm willing to compromise with them, but they need to treat me like their neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1312)|
| 0:21:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| So I can appreciate that you're understandably upset that you weren't given the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| That really is what I was speaking about kind of getting off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| Yeah, I'm not happy that I was not given the opportunity to stand here and speak for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1332)|
| 0:22:20| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| No, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| I'm not quite sure if I really totally agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| I mean, I do agree that you ought to be able to do what you want with your property, and I accept and believe in property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1347)|
| 0:22:37| You happen to be, you know, owner of a piece of property that many of the people identify as sort of like the frame of the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1357)|
| 0:22:48| It's a very elegant and elemental, fundamental piece of how people see their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1368)|
| 0:22:55| And you understand that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| So that's where this concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| I understand that concern, but I'm not proposing to put any condominiums or a contemporary home or anything that will hurt the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1381)|
| 0:23:10| But you would have initially preferred to have had a conversation with your neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| Okay, fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Then, if this is their concern, where were they when a steel building was built on the adjacent property that's bigger than my house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1396)|
| 0:23:27| He combined his lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| He put a steel building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| That doesn't conform with anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Why didn't they raise their voices then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| I'm going to go to Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| I'm not sure who was next, but go ahead, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| Yeah, I guess a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| I still think Councilman Woodall asked what's the issue that we're going to address if we address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1423)|
| 0:23:50| And I'm still confused about what the issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| And at some point, my sense is folks need to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| And I don't know exactly what the question, but some level of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| let's draw pictures of what the worst that could happen or our vision of what needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| Because I'm not quite clear still what we're trying to fix, which makes it really hard to figure out what we should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1444)|
| 0:24:12| I originally put my light on after Ms. Pelo talked a little earlier about the way that this needs to be fixed is through better communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1452)|
| 0:24:22| And I think that's critical to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| And at some level, this is a well-organized neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| People do generally talk to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| I mean, it's a big turnout from a fairly small neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| It feels like at some point there's got to be some of the information that Mr. Donaldson has now shared with folks in a public meeting there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| about what can be done and can't and what are those solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| I don't know if that two-hour meeting that happened last week would have been better as a public meeting in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| But something like that's eventually got to happen at some level to talk about what are the possibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| because that's how communications open up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| I think I'm not willing to support even the 14-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| And partly it's because I still, again, I don't get what the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| At some level, I hear maybe there are going to be a few other drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| I hear a little bit about the shape of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| I sort of understand, Ms. Craig, your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| I don't know that preventing a new building permit being issued in the next two weeks, whether it makes a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1519)|
| 0:25:26| This is a problem that's bigger for the whole neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| And it feels like something that's going to take a while to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| So I don't know what delaying two weeks does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| But we do need to keep working on this somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| Well, you know, it's a terrible thing for one person to cast judgment on a number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1544)|
| 0:25:53| I just see a number of mistakes that have been made here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| I don't think you can, I think there's enough blame to just, for everybody to take their share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| And lack of communication is what, you know, it's what it's all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| It just is a deadly thing when it occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| It's very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| You cannot go back and sop up the words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| You can't go back and take away the fears, the passion and everything that is a result from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1575)|
| 0:26:24| And that's just such an unfortunate thing, and that's why I don't think it belongs before city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| And so it's my disappointment with what's happened in the last two weeks is that it just seemed to me a simple thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1590)|
| 0:26:40| to have a public meeting, to have Mr. Donaldson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| and these department heads and these people who did have answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| and who could provide clarification to be involved not with just the district councilman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1606)|
| 0:26:53| who could not be here tonight and everyone was aware of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| but to be involved with all these folks who are here seeking answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| And I just see a real unfortunate circumstance that we're trying to work through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1622)|
| 0:27:09| I still think, as Mr. Becker said, that that is just, it needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1629)|
| 0:27:15| I don't know how it happens unless we extend this moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1635)|
| 0:27:23| I don't see otherwise how we have any ability to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| And that's where I'm just stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| Councilman Hoffman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| Mr. Donaldson, if this moratorium is not extended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| could this meeting that Ms. Pelo just discussed actually take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| I mean, that's what I got out of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| The meeting can happen whether there's a moratorium or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| Well, Councilman Woodhull said something earlier about someone taking, I think you used the word leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| and I said ownership, and we're both saying the same thing, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| So, now, how does this council impose that kind of ownership or that kind of requirement on these folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1682)|
| 0:28:12| That's what I don't see how this council can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| Mr. Swanson, maybe are you the one I'm looking to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| But does a moratorium do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| Not unless it has those conditions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Any other comments from members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| Are you ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Remember, we're voting on the actual amendment at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| We're voting on the motion to amend the 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| Well, no, the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| And new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| So it was all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| And did we ever talk about putting the language in about what we're asking to be fixed during the moratorium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1726)|
| 0:28:55| I don't think there was a fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| I think it was more of a communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| What do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| We're voting on the motion as amended to 14 days and only to apply to amend the motion to 14 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1746)|
| 0:29:14| and only apply to new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| We're voting on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| All those in favor of the amendment, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| I want to do a roll call just to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| Vice Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Councilman Pelo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| Councilman Whithall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Now we're discussing on the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| It failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| Now we're back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| After 10, my brain is even weaker than normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Yeah, this is just an idea to sort of get at Ms. Pelo's concern of not just sort of letting this lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1795)|
| 0:30:02| You know, if we don't do anything, we haven't done anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| And, Mr. Swanson, check on this, but if we took Section 1 and just deleted the first sentence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1804)|
| 0:30:11| and then deleted everything that said moratorium and, in effect, passing something that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| the professional staff of the Metropolitan Planning Commission and other such persons or entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| may be necessary, we respectfully request it and encourage to study carefully the zoning subdivision related to such property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1821)|
| 0:30:29| and to make – is something like that doable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| It's doable, but it's a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| It's not an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| So that would be the challenge with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| You could come back next time with a resolution that says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| Now we're back to voting on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| Sorry for the chairman messing us up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| We'll do roll call again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=1859)|

| 0:34:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2078)|

| 0:34:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| Hubert Smith, P.O. Box 607, Knoxville 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| The reason that I'm here tonight, Mayor and Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| is because I'm concerned about the protest that occurred on May 26, 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| between the self-described white supremacists and the counterprotesters on Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2100)|
| 0:35:06| First of all, let me say I'm a free speech advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| The speech is not my issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| The demonstration is not my issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| Their cause is not my issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| I support Amendment 1 to the Constitution of the United States of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| What concerns me is the location of the protest itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| So that's what I want to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| And the rain is kind of appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| You'll see my point here shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| As you all know, since 2003, we've had the Transfer Center located right behind us on Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| And I'm sure there are a lot of people out there getting wet as we speak, as we're dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| On a daily basis, approximately 3,000 passengers a day pass through the Transfer Center, give or take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2146)|
| 0:35:53| On weekends, it's a little less, say maybe about half that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| And this protest occurred on a weekend day, on a Saturday on May 26,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| and I think they're scheduled again on June 16, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| Chief, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| June 16, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| My problem is that I think it's totally unfair to our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2172)|
| 0:36:20| and disrespectful to our citizens to require Knoxville Area Transit to pick up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| and move the Transfer Station for a day to accommodate out-of-town protesters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2186)|
| 0:36:33| That's my issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| As I discussed with some of you earlier about five hours ago, Mr. Anderson said he was unaware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| some of you council members have said you were unaware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| that the Transfer Center was actually moved from Main Street down to Locust Street for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2204)|
| 0:36:53| I believe that local citizens should not be deprived of the use of their transit center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| and what amenities it does offer to accommodate out-of-town protesters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2219)|
| 0:37:06| The conditions your passengers were placed in were miserable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| I say your passengers because they're all of your citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| Some of you elected to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| Some of you too appointed to serve one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| Buses were lined up on both sides of Locust Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| Because of the space that they have, Locust Street being a one-way street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| they could not all line up in single file as they do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| They had to line up on both sides of the street instead of boarding an exit on curbside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2249)|
| 0:37:36| Normally, an operator is penalized with a suspension or possibly termination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2256)|
| 0:37:43| for allowing a passenger to board an exit on the street, not curbside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| There are liability issues here allowing that to happen or, in this case, forcing that to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| because Knox Larry Transit had no choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| Now, let me go back and say before I came to council tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| I did call Cindy McGinnis, who is the new general manager, and ask her why that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| She said because she was told to, and the city owns the bus system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| I think that's a fair answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| She does what the city says do, and she said that's what the city told her to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| She was not given an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| I called Mr. Kenner to further inquire on the city's behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| Was a permit required for this action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| He said no, so I asked, well, why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| And, Randy, forgive me because it's late and I'm tired, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| and I don't recall exactly what your comment was, but basically that was the city's decision to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2311)|
| 0:38:40| Other than being liability issues, I think these are also humane issues as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| What you are requiring to do is you're requiring the elderly and disabled who ride on Saturdays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| they don't all of a sudden get cars on Saturdays like they don't have any other day of the week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| and you require them on May 26th to endure 90-degree heat without, there's no benches, there's no shelters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2336)|
| 0:39:04| there are no accommodations on Locust Street, and it very well could be like this on June 16th, raining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2344)|
| 0:39:11| and so you're going to be putting your people out on Locust Street again on June 16th just like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2351)|
| 0:39:20| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| So, finally, again, on Locust Street there are no shelters, on Locust Street there are no benches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| on Locust Street there are no schedules, there are no accommodations for passengers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| I think your citizens deserve no less observance of their rights than do out-of-town protesters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2370)|
| 0:39:38| I think this is a very, very serious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| I don't know all the ins and outs of everything that KPD is doing, but I do know that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2381)|
| 0:39:47| and I'm a transportation writer, I'm a transportation advocate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| I do know that we have a responsibility to our people as well as defending somebody else's right to express freedom of speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2391)|
| 0:40:00| Surely we can do better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| I do not think we should uproot mayor, council, our transit system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| to accommodate a handful of people to come on the courthouse steps and protest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| It's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| I hope you all will say something about it tonight and put something on the table about this for discussion, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2412)|
| 0:40:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| It's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| I was not there for the protest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| I mean, it might be interesting to ask Chief Rayl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| are there possibilities of not relocating the transfer point and still allowing this kind of event to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2435)|
| 0:40:45| Well, first let me say that Mr. Smith is a friend of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| I've known him for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| You know, this is not falling on deaf ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| I'll let you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| We do have a, again, we do have another protest that we know that is scheduled for the 16th of June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| and certainly it's something that we can take a look at and maybe see if we can find some alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| I can't promise anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| What we try to do is we try to ensure the safety of all citizens involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| We realize that in moving the transfer station, when it was moved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| the idea was to ensure the safety of those passengers, to keep them out of potential harm's way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2477)|
| 0:41:25| We didn't really, at the particular time, we weren't really given a definite venue as to where the site was going to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2485)|
| 0:41:35| We were given three different venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| We had to plan for all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| We also realized that in planning for this particular site here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| when somebody came to the courthouse to protest that we needed an area of security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2503)|
| 0:41:53| which we basically call a neutral zone, to ensure the safety of all involved, both protesters and the anti-protesters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2513)|
| 0:42:02| Let me simply say this, that though the protest did occur here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| and we're not an advocate of what people come oftentimes to protest, but we do have to ensure their safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2526)|
| 0:42:15| Let me simply say this, that we were able to ensure the safety of all the citizens involved this last particular incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2535)|
| 0:42:24| because of the fact that nobody received any injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| I do know that two people went to jail, unfortunately for them, but everybody got to go home safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| We will work with Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| We'll take a look at this and see what we can do about coming up with an alternate plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| But, again, I can't promise anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| And, again, Hubert, it's not following deaf ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| May I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| I'm not responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| Well, go ahead real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| Real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| I don't have any negotiating power, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| I don't run CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| I don't run anything, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| I'm here because those people can't be here because they don't have options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| I don't know anybody in here that's going to get out there and get on a bus tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| Nor all of you council members who I spoke with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| I didn't find any one of you that even knew this had happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| Now you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| I'm telling you, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| And I think it's wrong, and I think you should not allow this to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| And, yes, the Chief and our friend, but it's not about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| It's not about me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| It's about those people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| And I think you'll have a responsibility to these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Ms. Peelum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| Well, I just wanted to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| I knew nothing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| I was out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| I knew nothing about the protest, and I certainly knew nothing about these circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| if Mr. Smith had not come and shared that with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| But I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| I don't know who to pose it to, Chief Roehl maybe or the Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| but Chief commented that there were three sites that were possible sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2629)|
| 0:43:58| Is there not a permit required or something for someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| Do we not have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| Go ahead, Chief Roehl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| It's my knowledge that a permit is not required unless they intend to march or have a parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:14| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| Well, our issue becomes then when they show up, we have to provide safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| Hubert's point is a great one, but we have to balance that versus safety needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| Yes, I think you're exactly the person that we should be negotiating with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| At some level, the folks out there aren't here for a lot of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| And you're as close as we've got to an organizer for the bus riders in this city right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2671)|
| 0:44:38| So, I mean, you might want to back off from taking that responsibility, but I think you've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| And I think we do need people like you to step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| Well, he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| Now we need to step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| May I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| And that's great and very flattering, but I volunteer all that I can volunteer, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| You pay people good money to run the bus system who do that very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| but when the general manager tells me she had no choice in the matter, she was told to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| and she goes where they say go, and they said go, then that's what she does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| So now I'm telling you all, for all of you who said you didn't know, now you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2712)|
| 0:45:18| Councilman Palo, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| No, I wish I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2722)|
| 0:45:23| Alonzo Montgomery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| I have a real quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| Did they choose the site or did we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| We can't choose a site for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| They have rights to protest wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| Can you not do those First Amendment protest zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| Which is for the law department, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| That largely pertains to trips from folks like the president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2746)|
| 0:45:55| It didn't really apply to this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| This is a right to assemble and speak, and they were on a public place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2756)|
| 0:46:02| and that's what the chief was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| We can't really tell them what public place they can stand on and speak and can't stand on and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2764)|
| 0:46:13| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| Let me say I appreciate you bringing that forward here, but I had not heard that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| and you and I haven't talked for you to even pass it on to me that that occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| And as the discussion is going, please keep me involved in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| because while I understand the safety issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| if there is something that is going to be done like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| there needs to be a better venue for that to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| And I understand the safety issue, and the riders on the buses here wouldn't be looking to engage any of those folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| but I get concerned when some of those folks will be looking to try to engage some of the riders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| So I understand that, but I also think it's not acceptable to have folk in the middle of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| and not under appropriate cover and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| So if there is something different that's going to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| there needs to be a more acceptable place for that to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| You know, and I get concerned about these marches from this point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2818)|
| 0:47:07| I think it's very important that while, yes, people have a First Amendment right together like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| you know, the message needs to be very clear that we, as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| do not agree with some of the statements that have been made by these groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| or sanction those just because these folks are allowed to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| And I think, to a degree, they keep coming back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| because somehow they've gotten a little feeling that they think since nobody, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| is kind of really stepping up saying anything, that we're sanctioning this thing a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| And we're not sanctioning this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| You know, I don't, and I've said this in some meetings, I think that message should go forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| that while you have a First Amendment right to gather and talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| that as far as my civilians are concerned and we're concerned, this is not the message we put forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| and we are not a people that believe in what these folk are espousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| So I've said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| But also, Chief, stay in touch with me on this issue, because I did not know that it occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| I had not been in on one meeting and was told that, I was not told about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| So I appreciate you bringing that forward here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| Officer Montgomery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| Mayor, how are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| I should have finished 30 minutes ago, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| Y'all getting me rained on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| It's your fault, though, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| No, we blame Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| That's what most people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| Yeah, blame Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| Alonzo Montgomery, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| Hey, Mr. Mayor, I came, you know, I'm often coming to your public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| Not all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| So pretty much the city ran pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| County Commission, they finally took my advice, Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| They can have a meeting in the evening, but they still have it at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| They need to have it at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| They all want to be back home by 6.30, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| And I understand why they have pastries in the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| because they're working on a $600 million budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| and the Sheriff's Department buys all the pastries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| That's why none of them sit around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| That's why they're all owned by the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| and they all migrate back there to eat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| because he's taking care of them to make sure they vote the way he wants them to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| But the other reason I'm here tonight, I hope they hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| That's why they're all fat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| Everything's fat at the county, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| Everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| Everything's fat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| J.J., you ought to be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| You're going to be fat, too, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| But, Mr. Mayor, on a serious note, Isabel Towers, I come before this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2950)|
| 0:49:17| and I remember it because I write down everything when I go home at night, whether it's funny or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| You know, I keep good records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| And I came before this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| and I've asked you all numerous times to do something about Isabel Towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| I went to Alvin Nance and asked him to do something about Isabel Towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| He's so busy and infatuated about tearing down those 537 units at Walter P. Taylor Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2976)|
| 0:49:45| Listen to me, Mr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| You know, y'all gung-ho about doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| I don't see anything funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| That young man that got killed there last night, I know those folk, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2992)|
| 0:49:58| A lot of them think I live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| No, I don't live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| I can go in my dwelling place and be comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| You know, I do this because I'm concerned about what I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| But that young man that died, if you all had listened, that could have been avoided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| One, if I was that young man's family, I'd be trying to sue the city of Knoxville and KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3013)|
| 0:50:20| because, one, you have no security over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| Half the people there is either from the state institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| Ms. Roddy, I'll be over early in the morning running, and I'll make a point to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3029)|
| 0:50:36| I see guys, it's a black guy, every morning he steps out at 630 in the morning with pants on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3036)|
| 0:50:43| a coat in 90 degrees heat, and talking to himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| Now, those folk that live in Morningside, they're homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| Some of them are single.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| Some of them got children, got to go out there every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| What if one of those folk get hold of somebody's children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| Y'all setting yourself up real good because if they came to me, I'd show them how to get y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| And I hope they listen tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| I'm smart enough to outsmart some of you that's smart, and I know I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| And I wouldn't mind giving a little bit of help to one of them to help get you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| because I've come here and I asked you all, and Alvin and them, they blow it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| See, everybody's blowing it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| They need to close down Isabel Towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| I went to Chief Sterling Owens, and I'll tell you, Mr. Mayor, he did just what I asked him to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3091)|
| 0:51:38| He went down hazing all down through Morningside in his own private POV because he's drug-infested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3098)|
| 0:51:46| But yet, if those homeowners are late on their taxes, y'all ready to take their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| Y'all need to do something about Isabel Towers because it's hot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| And, Mr. Mayor, it starts right about now over on that side of town in that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3117)|
| 0:52:03| Drugs, man, there's more drugs in Isabel Towers than Walter P. Taylor, Austin Home, Western Heights, Lonsdale put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3123)|
| 0:52:12| That building needs to be knocked down, Mr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| Y'all need to get it out of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| I know there's some good people living there, but y'all need to find a place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| You know, I sit here and watch y'all for an hour and a half talk about island homes tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3142)|
| 0:52:27| I heard Channel 6 talk about it this morning like it's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| But it's somebody's son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| Maybe they was on crack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| Maybe he wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| Maybe he was defending himself from somebody that was on crack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| Because, you know what, Mr. Mayor, and I'm going to close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| but Catherine Woodall, when it comes to Isabel Towers, the city, if it comes to those projects, you put a policeman over her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3162)|
| 0:52:51| They got certain units that y'all got officers in Walter P. Taylor homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3171)|
| 0:52:57| There is no one, Mr. Mayor, at Isabel Towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| And when that woman leaves out at 730 in the morning going to Oak Ridge, she don't know if she's going to be attacked or not right in front of her home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3180)|
| 0:53:07| That could be your wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| That could be your child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| But y'all don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| You know what I told myself tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| I'm going to quit coming to these public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| I haven't done anything in seven years, but I'm going to stop coming to public forums because it's a joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| It's a joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| Y'all sit there and you do nothing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| People sit here three and four hours and listen to your entire agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| And then when they come with a situation, y'all don't do nothing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| Isabel Towers could have been avoided tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| I warned you guys, but you put on a deaf ear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| Y'all were warned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| But I hope they do sue the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| They should definitely go after KCDC because KCDC ought to have some kind of security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| I don't mean no national security, one of them old private security agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| If it's public domain and if the city police is in everybody else's business, in every other project, and KCDC, I go through there, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3233)|
| 0:54:04| when somebody don't pay that little bit of rent or they do get caught for drugs, they put the stuff out right there in their doggone community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3244)|
| 0:54:13| And that's a nice subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| These people, them houses worth $90,000, $95,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| Now, they used to be, it wasn't worth that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| But come on, Mr. Mayor, y'all need to knock down Isabel Towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| I'm asking, sir, that you take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| I know it's a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| If Chief Owens went down through there and he was here tonight, he'll tell you it's a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| And something needs to be done, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| Thank you. We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070605d2?start=3278)|
