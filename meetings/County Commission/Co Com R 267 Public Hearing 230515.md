|     154 |   162 | We've had three elementary schools and three high schools go on lockdown, two separate times each.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=154.0)  |
|     162 |   170 | On top of that, we have a third grade retention law, which later this week will destined thousands of third graders                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=162.0)  |

|     200 |   204 | They're not going to be able to take advantage of the opportunities in front of them.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=200.0)  |
|     204 |   212 | And they're not going to be able to grow and to contribute to our community as they or we would hope they would.                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=204.0)  |
|     212 |   219 | And to all our KCS teachers and all our KCSO deputies, this budget says to them,                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=212.0)  |

|     230 |   237 | If you think the KCSO and the KCS staff and shortages are bad now, pass this budget as it is.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=230.0)  |
|     237 |   242 | Because next year, it will become much worse.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=237.0)  |
|     242 |   245 | You're going to have to make hard decisions at some point.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=242.0)  |
|     245 |   250 | And the longer you wait to make those decisions, the more painful it's going to be.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=245.0)  |

|     254 |   260 | And the longer you wait to make those decisions, the less safe our communities are going to become.                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=254.0)  |
|     260 |   266 | So, Godspeed to this commission as you consider this budget.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=260.0)  |
|     266 |   273 | I hope you have the courage to do what our mayor does not and put our people over our politics.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=266.0)  |
|     273 |   275 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=273.0)  |
|     275 |   280 | Thank you. This concludes our public forum for this hearing.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=275.0)  |
|     281 |   287 | Next on our agenda, we do not have a specific list of department heads and officials wishing to speak.                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=281.0)  |
|     287 |   290 | However, I do see some in the audience.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=287.0)  |
|     290 |   296 | Commissioners, if you have any questions for them or comments, feel free to turn your light on at any time.                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=290.0)  |
|     296 |   306 | And with that, I will start us off with Director Caldwell to offer any comments that he has regarding this budget for fiscal year 24.                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=296.0)  |
|     311 |   314 | Good afternoon.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=311.0)  |
|     314 |   324 | I know that we have all met to discuss this document, so I won't bore you with a lot of repetitive stuff.                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=314.0)  |
|     324 |   333 | Ultimately, this budget is about a $90.3 million increase over current year FY23.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=324.0)  |
|     334 |   342 | From budget to budget, about $65 of that $90 is related to TISA funding from the state.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=334.0)  |
|     342 |   350 | And this budget includes a 4% pay increase for certified and classified school employees,                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=342.0)  |
|     350 |   364 | a 3% raise for general county employees, and a proposed 8% raise for sheriff's officers, captain, and below.                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=350.0)  |
|     364 |   369 | The general fund is up about $12 million.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=364.0)  |
|     369 |   374 | Half of that $12 million is directed toward KCSO.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=369.0)  |
|     374 |   385 | Engineering and Public Works is up about $1.4 million.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=374.0)  |
|     385 |   391 | There's about a 12% increase in aiding this budget.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=385.0)  |
|     391 |   395 | Hotel and motel tax is up about $1.5 million.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=391.0)  |
|     396 |   411 | And so, this budget, from a standpoint of a curriculum, does have growth in property tax and sales tax.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=396.0)  |
|     411 |   419 | The sales tax growth is relatively flat from what we anticipate ending this fiscal year with.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=411.0)  |
|     420 |   427 | I emailed with you all a report today about economic forecast,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=420.0)  |
|     427 |   435 | and it's the same dashboard that I've been sharing with you all for a few months now with some additional information.                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=427.0)  |
|     435 |   442 | And that dashboard has gotten increasingly more red and yellow and less green, if you know what that means.                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=435.0)  |
|     442 |   453 | And so, basically implying that a recession is looming, and it says in there that there's some conflicting data.                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=442.0)  |
|     453 |   466 | But basically, we based this budget off the economic forecast from the Boyd Center, which basically showed flat growth for Tennessee.                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=453.0)  |
|     466 |   471 | So, that's basically just a summary.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=466.0)  |
|     471 |   474 | I'm here to answer any questions that you may have.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=471.0)  |
|     474 |   478 | And I look forward to it.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=474.0)  |
|     478 |   480 | Thank you, Director Caldwell.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=478.0)  |

|     484 |   492 | Director Caldwell, thank goodness we got more money back from the new formula, from the BEP.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=484.0)  |

|     496 |   506 | Explain to everyone that's watching what the difference between the running BEP and the other $68 million,                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=496.0)  |
|     506 |   516 | unless I say experts or money anyway, $68 million, and how much of that increase in that school's budget is sales tax?                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=506.0)  |
|     516 |   518 | How much sales tax?                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=516.0)  |
|     518 |   524 | Yeah, so I'm going to ask Ron or Joe to come down and let them talk about this.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=518.0)  |
|     524 |   526 | They are definitely experts.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=524.0)  |
|     526 |   529 | There's a lot of one-time growth this first year on TISA.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=526.0)  |
|     529 |   535 | And the schools have done a good job to not put a lot of that into recurring expenses.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=529.0)  |
|     535 |   536 | I'll let them get into that.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=535.0)  |
|     536 |   542 | But you mentioned sales tax dollars and property tax dollars.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=536.0)  |
|     542 |   547 | And so, let's talk about maintenance of effort as it relates to schools.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=542.0)  |
|     547 |   556 | This budget increases maintenance of effort right at $4.1 million, which is about 1.2 percent.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=547.0)  |
|     556 |   567 | We moved four pennies from property tax, $7.6 million, out of the general purpose school budget into debt service to pay for school debt.              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=556.0)  |
|     567 |   569 | And this accomplishes two things.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=567.0)  |
|     569 |   575 | One, it lowers maintenance of efforts as we're headed into an uncertain economy.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=569.0)  |
|     575 |   577 | It's a number that is attainable.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=575.0)  |
|     577 |   580 | We feel we're looking at that.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=577.0)  |
|     580 |   591 | The second thing that it does is if anyone is asking for a TIF from county commission, you have to pay the debt service amount of property tax.        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=580.0)  |
|     592 |   605 | This increases that amount so the county schools, the county, would get more money on a TIF as it relates to anybody asking for an abatement on taxes. | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=592.0)  |
|     605 |   616 | So, from our standpoint, the increase on property tax budget to budget was about $3.5 million.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=605.0)  |
|     617 |   619 | I'm sorry, it went down.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=617.0)  |
|     619 |   624 | It was a decrease of about, do this math.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=619.0)  |
|     624 |   625 | I never do math.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=624.0)  |
|     625 |   626 | Oh, you're wrong.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=625.0)  |
|     626 |   629 | About $3.5 million decrease.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=626.0)  |
|     629 |   635 | There was an increase in property taxes of about $5 million.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=629.0)  |
|     635 |   643 | And so, that $5 million is kind of what we anticipated to end the year at a certain point in time, and we just kept that number flat.                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=635.0)  |
|     644 |   650 | But, like I said, made its effort up just for $1.1 million, which is 1.2%.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=644.0)  |
|     650 |   652 | I'm going to let Ron talk to you about this.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=650.0)  |
|     655 |   657 | Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the committee.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=655.0)  |
|     658 |   663 | Yes, Chris accurately spoke about property tax.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=658.0)  |
|     663 |   673 | So, for Moscow schools, there's a shift where pennies have resulted in a decrease after netted against natural growth.                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=663.0)  |
|     673 |   676 | It's a decrease of about $3.6 million in property tax.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=673.0)  |
|     676 |   680 | Sales tax, we're showing budget to budget, an increase of about $8.4 million.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=676.0)  |
|     680 |   693 | So, that net effect for a local increase is about $3.7, $3.8 million, which is about 1% of growth over and above the prior year budget.                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=680.0)  |
|     693 |   698 | Our largest area of increase is in fact TISA.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=693.0)  |
|     698 |   706 | We want to be really careful of and how we commit those funds because, and I mentioned this before,                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=698.0)  |
|     706 |   712 | that the growth models that the state is providing in future years appear to be very modest.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=706.0)  |
|     712 |   721 | Sure, there's a significant increase in year one, and then afterwards it appears to be very modest increases thereafter.                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=712.0)  |
|     721 |   727 | So, we wanted to be really guarded about not to overcommit those funds, right?                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=721.0)  |
|     727 |   735 | So, you don't want to commit all of those funds to recurring initiatives only to roll into the following year                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=727.0)  |
|     735 |   743 | and not have sufficient inflationary increases in funding to sustain those initiatives that you just programmed in.                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=735.0)  |
|     743 |   751 | So, when we developed the FY24 budget, we also had our eyes on FY25 and beyond                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=743.0)  |
|     751 |   760 | because we know that there is going to be challenges in having the capacity afforded into our budget for those subsequent years.                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=751.0)  |
|     760 |   771 | And so, when we looked at this, we wanted to be very strategic in how we programmed those dollars.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=760.0)  |
|     771 |   774 | And so, what we did is we looked at our debt.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=771.0)  |
|     774 |   781 | We always have an eye and work very closely with Chris and his staff in an effort to mitigate those debt levels.                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=774.0)  |
|     781 |   792 | What we decided is to program a significant amount of those dollars into what otherwise would have been a bond issue.                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=781.0)  |
|     792 |   799 | It's for certain capital improvement projects, which will save us about, we estimate about $14 million over 20 years.                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=792.0)  |
|     799 |   804 | So, that was one of our strategic options to create that capacity going forward.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=799.0)  |
|     804 |   813 | And then coupled with that, ESSER funding goes away in September of 2024.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=804.0)  |
|     813 |   821 | So, we have some really worthwhile initiatives programmed in ESSER like tutors, mental health supports,                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=813.0)  |
|     821 |   829 | classroom technology student devices, professional development opportunities for our teachers,                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=821.0)  |
|     829 |   840 | work-based learning, career and college empowerment priority, which would include counselors and academy coaches,                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=829.0)  |
|     840 |   846 | and some really strong initiatives at the high school level, interventions.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=840.0)  |
|     846 |   853 | So, I'm saying all of that to say that we purposely chose not to overcommit those dollars,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=846.0)  |
|     853 |   860 | knowing that if ESSER goes away in September 2024, we don't want to be back to the funding body saying,                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=853.0)  |
|     860 |   865 | well, gee, we don't have the dollars to fund this, right?                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=860.0)  |
|     865 |   871 | So, we want to be really proactive in managing our dollars wisely as we look towards future years.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=865.0)  |
|     871 |   876 | And so, that's why we wanted to be careful with the additional amount.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=871.0)  |
|     876 |   885 | Because we've heard from some of our colleagues in other districts that they're programming these costs into recurring initiatives.                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=876.0)  |
|     885 |   890 | And so, we're thinking as they're doing that, gee, you may want to be careful about that, right?                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=885.0)  |
|     890 |   894 | Because anything can change on future models from the state.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=890.0)  |
|     894 |   900 | But based on what they share so far, the increases do appear to be very modest.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=894.0)  |
|     900 |   907 | And so, that's why we have to be very cautious in how we program these funds.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=900.0)  |
|     907 |   911 | Thank you, sir. Commissioner Oster?                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=907.0)  |
|     911 |   916 | Thank you so much for your time. I do have a couple of questions for Mr. Caldwell.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=911.0)  |
|     916 |   918 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=916.0)  |
|     918 |   927 | Commissioner Oster, if you don't care, I will ask if anybody else has anything regarding the school's budget.                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=918.0)  |
|     927 |   932 | Commissioner Lee? Is that okay? Thank you.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=927.0)  |
|     937 |   950 | Mr. Caldwell, I'd like to ask, how did the budget account for the decrease in students on the county school budget?                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=937.0)  |
|     951 |   959 | One of the mayor's four priorities focuses on public education.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=951.0)  |
|     959 |   971 | And so, in our conversations with schools, historically, we have always given schools natural growth.                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=959.0)  |
|     971 |   979 | And he wants to continue that trend, but also wanted to manage maintenance of effort as much as possible.                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=971.0)  |
|     979 |   988 | And so, ultimately, we moved the four pennies to debt service to manage maintenance of effort, to keep it flat,                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=979.0)  |
|     988 |   992 | flat-ish, I guess you could say, so 1.2% growth.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=988.0)  |
|     992 |   999 | And so, we know that the school population is fairly flat.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=992.0)  |
|     999 |  1004 | But as we looked at this budget with the increased funding in TISA,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=999.0)  |
|    1004 |  1011 | he was comfortable getting to a number that we obtained,                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1004.0) |
|    1011 |  1020 | which would give them 1.2% of recurring growth in revenue,                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1011.0) |
|    1020 |  1024 | and allowing them to do some key priorities, which include,                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1020.0) |
|    1024 |  1031 | there's a reading program that the mayor has sponsored for two or three years now, and a couple of other things.                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1024.0) |
|    1031 |  1038 | And so, while he knows that the population is fairly flat, this was his proposal,                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1031.0) |
|    1038 |  1047 | and he was content with keeping maintenance of effort a little bit above what is legally required.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1038.0) |
|    1047 |  1049 | And one follow-up question.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1047.0) |
|    1049 |  1054 | So, how would that affect once the TISA funds go away?                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1049.0) |
|    1055 |  1059 | So, what Ron talked about.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1055.0) |
|    1059 |  1060 | Thank you, Commissioner.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1059.0) |
|    1060 |  1063 | We're hopeful the TISA funds do not go away.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1060.0) |
|    1063 |  1068 | What our concern is is that there's not a whole lot of growth in subsequent years for those funds,                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1063.0) |
|    1068 |  1076 | which is why we wanted to be very cautious to not commit so many of the issues that we can't fund those in subsequent years                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1068.0) |
|    1076 |  1079 | just based on inflationary cost increases.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1076.0) |
|    1079 |  1081 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1079.0) |
|    1081 |  1082 | Mr. Schuman here.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1081.0) |
|    1082 |  1083 | Thank you, Madam Chair.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1082.0) |
|    1083 |  1087 | Ron, I do appreciate what you do for Knox County Schools.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1083.0) |
|    1087 |  1091 | Anybody with finance has a monumental task.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1087.0) |
|    1091 |  1096 | Well, I've got a great team, so I think it would be great to throw a budget close.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1091.0) |
|    1096 |  1100 | Well, kind of a follow-up to Commissioner Lee's question.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1096.0) |
|    1100 |  1105 | I went back and I looked at when I came on County Commission,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1100.0) |
|    1105 |  1114 | and in that 2014-2015 school year, there were 57,600 students.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1105.0) |
|    1114 |  1120 | And this year, your team just told me it was 58,600.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1114.0) |
|    1120 |  1126 | So, in nine years, our student population has increased 1,000 students.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1120.0) |
|    1126 |  1133 | I went back and I looked at the budget for Knox County Schools in that 2014-2015 period                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1126.0) |
|    1133 |  1140 | and noticed the difference today that in nine years, your budget has increased 54%                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1133.0) |
|    1140 |  1145 | for 1,000 more that you're having to take care of.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1140.0) |
|    1145 |  1152 | The other question is, when you look at the state's contribution this year over last year,                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1145.0) |
|    1152 |  1155 | you're picking up $65.5 million.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1152.0) |
|    1155 |  1160 | It's probably $61 million to $62 million, yes.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1155.0) |
|    1160 |  1166 | Okay, well, on the budget document that we have on page 25, it says it's $65.5 million.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1160.0) |
|    1166 |  1174 | Then you're picking up some additional resources, which tops it out at $68.5 over the previous year.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1166.0) |
|    1174 |  1176 | Okay?                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1174.0) |
|    1176 |  1184 | So, it's our responsibility as the County Commission to make sure that by state statute                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1176.0) |
|    1184 |  1187 | that we give you the same amount as the previous year.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1184.0) |
|    1188 |  1195 | So, how do we tell our constituents when you're getting an extra $65.5 million,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1188.0) |
|    1195 |  1201 | actually $68.5 million, more than what we're required to give you,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1195.0) |
|    1201 |  1204 | but you're getting it from the state, okay,                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1201.0) |
|    1204 |  1210 | that why are we not decreasing a certain portion of our property tax                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1204.0) |
|    1210 |  1215 | that goes towards Knox County Schools to maybe split the difference, you know,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1210.0) |
|    1215 |  1221 | so that we now can have the opportunity to fund county operations,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1215.0) |
|    1221 |  1226 | such as the road paving and residential neighborhoods,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1221.0) |
|    1226 |  1233 | the needed maintenance on our parks and our libraries, and our jail as well.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1226.0) |
|    1233 |  1240 | So, my question is, you're getting bonus money this year that the general fund is not getting,                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1233.0) |
|    1241 |  1248 | but yet we're still having to fund you at the same level of property tax that we did the previous year.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1241.0) |
|    1248 |  1249 | Thank you, Commissioner.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1248.0) |
|    1249 |  1254 | I would answer that, that over the last several years we've made incredible strides                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1249.0) |
|    1254 |  1258 | in increasing teacher pay.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1254.0) |
|    1258 |  1261 | We have been able to meet the memorandum of understanding.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1258.0) |
|    1261 |  1267 | This will be, I think, the third year in a row, maybe four out of five years, I don't know.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1261.0) |
|    1267 |  1269 | Prior to that, we had never met.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1267.0) |
|    1269 |  1276 | And we have, over some of the years that you covered there, we have been from, I think,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1269.0) |
|    1276 |  1279 | don't hold me to this, I'm trying to do this from memory,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1276.0) |
|    1279 |  1285 | maybe around 11th or 12th in the area to 4th.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1279.0) |
|    1285 |  1293 | And so we have, I mean, I would say, and I could, you know, I'd have to go back in previous budgets                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1285.0) |
|    1293 |  1297 | and where all those dollars go, but we can absolutely get that.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1293.0) |
|    1298 |  1306 | For a 4% raise, it's $20 million, simply because we have 4,500 teachers, right?                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1298.0) |
|    1306 |  1314 | We've also raised our custodial pay, educational assistant pay, school clerical pay,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1306.0) |
|    1314 |  1318 | 12% this year, 8% in the two years prior to that.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1314.0) |
|    1318 |  1324 | So a considerable amount of those dollars has gone towards what we consider                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1318.0) |
|    1324 |  1329 | very critical positions for the mission of our school.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1324.0) |
|    1329 |  1332 | What we were finding is that some of our better teachers,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1329.0) |
|    1332 |  1334 | and we still have some of this dynamic going on,                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1332.0) |
|    1334 |  1341 | some of our better teachers routinely were going to other surrounding districts.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1334.0) |
|    1341 |  1348 | They were considerably more, like Maryville and Oak Ridge and Alcoa and some of those.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1341.0) |
|    1348 |  1352 | And so we were, in a sense, trying to stop the leak, but we had a long ways to go.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1348.0) |
|    1352 |  1357 | And so we've programmed a lot of those dollars, like over the last, those years you mentioned.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1352.0) |
|    1357 |  1360 | I mean, that's a significant amount of investment.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1357.0) |
|    1360 |  1368 | And so we've programmed that a lot of, also into these critical positions that,                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1360.0) |
|    1368 |  1372 | to be quite honest, we're struggling to find, we're struggling to fill vacancies.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1368.0) |
|    1372 |  1378 | And so it's been a purposeful decision to do that as well.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1372.0) |
|    1378 |  1381 | So I'm not saying that's where all of our initiatives went.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1378.0) |
|    1381 |  1385 | That's where a considerable amount of the dollars have gone back into the classroom.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1381.0) |
|    1385 |  1392 | So I think Tennessee is probably, don't hold me to this either,                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1385.0) |
|    1392 |  1397 | but maybe about 41st in per-pupil funding in the country.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1392.0) |
|    1397 |  1401 | And I think, I can't speak for the governor, but I think with the governor,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1397.0) |
|    1401 |  1409 | with this significant reform to education, he also has in mind that, sure,                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1401.0) |
|    1409 |  1411 | enrollment has decreased in some areas.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1409.0) |
|    1411 |  1414 | In fact, it's decreased across the entire state.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1411.0) |
|    1414 |  1418 | But he came out with this initiative anyway because we were, so far,                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1414.0) |
|    1418 |  1424 | we were lagging so far in student investments with respect to the nation as a whole.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1418.0) |
|    1424 |  1430 | And I think in spite of the fact that maybe we're having a smaller amount of,                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1424.0) |
|    1430 |  1435 | or a smaller number of enrollment, he wants to increase the investment                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1430.0) |
|    1435 |  1437 | in those students that are here.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1435.0) |
|    1437 |  1442 | And so we actually were on a trajectory of increasing enrollment and then COVID hit.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1437.0) |
|    1442 |  1448 | And so when that hit, everybody started seeing a lot of those numbers coming down.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1442.0) |
|    1448 |  1451 | They're gradually coming back up again.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1448.0) |
|    1451 |  1455 | So anyway, I don't know if that answered your question,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1451.0) |
|    1455 |  1460 | but I can tell you that's where a lot of our focus has been.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1455.0) |
|    1460 |  1461 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1460.0) |
|    1461 |  1465 | So of the $68 million, you're going to use $20 million for teacher salaries?                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1461.0) |
|    1465 |  1467 | It's about half of that.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1465.0) |
|    1467 |  1472 | So it's going to be 4% increase for teachers, all personnel.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1467.0) |
|    1472 |  1481 | It's going to be, well, 12% would also be for security guards,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1472.0) |
|    1481 |  1488 | educational assistants, school clerical, and who am I missing?                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1481.0) |
|    1488 |  1490 | Custodians, right?                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1488.0) |
|    1490 |  1491 | So that's probably about half.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1490.0) |
|    1491 |  1495 | As I look at some of our other investments,                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1491.0) |
|    1495 |  1499 | and when I sent this I sent something to the finance committee as well                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1495.0) |
|    1499 |  1505 | that kind of, I think, laid out what the investments are.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1499.0) |
|    1505 |  1509 | I will tell you that about $23 million, $24 million of those dollars                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1505.0) |
|    1509 |  1513 | are going into capital to pay down the debt that we talked about                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1509.0) |
|    1513 |  1516 | that will save us $14 million over time.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1513.0) |
|    1516 |  1519 | Because previous to this budget,                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1516.0) |
|    1519 |  1522 | we have about $18 or $19 million of recurring debt                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1519.0) |
|    1522 |  1524 | in the general purpose budget.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1522.0) |
|    1524 |  1527 | So that's why we wanted to pay part of that down                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1524.0) |
|    1527 |  1531 | so that we could have the ability to program,                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1527.0) |
|    1531 |  1534 | to do some educational issues that we otherwise wouldn't.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1531.0) |
|    1534 |  1536 | That goes back to the fact that we didn't want to overcommit                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1534.0) |
|    1536 |  1538 | those TISA dollars.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1536.0) |
|    1538 |  1544 | $7 million of the increase would be school-based funding,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1538.0) |

|    1551 |  1553 | There were some things that were very important for them,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1551.0) |

|    1600 |  1602 | We actually did a budget survey.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1600.0) |

|    1667 |  1675 | Some of that also becomes directly related to new state                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1667.0) |

|    1686 |  1689 | but do not put the dollars behind it.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1686.0) |

|    1729 |  1732 | and think that it's not going to pop somewhere else.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1729.0) |
|    1732 |  1737 | And I applaud the schools because you have started expanding that.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1732.0) |
|    1737 |  1742 | Another thing too that I just might add to all this is                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1737.0) |
|    1742 |  1746 | it's not only, even though enrollment may have dropped,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1742.0) |
|    1746 |  1750 | the distribution of students and where they all decide to land themselves                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1746.0) |
|    1750 |  1752 | in our county has not dropped.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1750.0) |
|    1752 |  1755 | In fact, they have spread out even more.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1752.0) |
|    1755 |  1758 | So this results in a thousand less students.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1755.0) |
|    1758 |  1761 | It may sound like that should equal 20 less teachers.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1758.0) |
|    1761 |  1766 | Well, if they all left the same school in the same grade, it probably would.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1761.0) |
|    1766 |  1769 | But when you spread that out over 90 schools,                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1766.0) |
|    1769 |  1776 | you still end up just about always having to have the same amount of staff,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1769.0) |
|    1776 |  1779 | regardless of a drop in enrollment.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1776.0) |
|    1779 |  1786 | So just a few more things to throw into my support of the schools.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1779.0) |
|    1786 |  1788 | Appreciate it. Thank you.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1786.0) |

|    1790 |  1791 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1790.0) |
|    1791 |  1795 | I have a follow-up question on Commissioner Schoonmaker's line of questioning.                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1791.0) |
|    1795 |  1803 | So there's a thousand more kids, 54% increase in budget from when you started, correct?                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1795.0) |
|    1803 |  1809 | So nine districts, 12 grades plus kindergarten and pre-K.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1803.0) |
|    1809 |  1816 | So you're looking at somewhere around five, six kids per grade increase per district.                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1809.0) |
|    1816 |  1819 | So not like a crazy amount.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1816.0) |
|    1819 |  1827 | But how much staff increase have we had since that time period?                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1819.0) |
|    1827 |  1828 | We'd have to go back and look.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1827.0) |
|    1828 |  1830 | We could get that.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1828.0) |
|    1830 |  1834 | I can tell you that we kind of along those lines.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1830.0) |
|    1834 |  1839 | So typically we have unbudgeted positions, right?                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1834.0) |
|    1839 |  1845 | Because we will, through the year, we may have, like, a BEP requirement that,                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1839.0) |
|    1845 |  1849 | oh, gee, more kids showed up in the first grade than what we were anticipating.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1845.0) |
|    1849 |  1851 | State law says we have to put another teacher there.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1849.0) |
|    1851 |  1853 | It's funded entirely from local, right?                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1851.0) |
|    1853 |  1854 | So we have a lot of that going on.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1853.0) |
|    1854 |  1858 | We also have a lot of with regards to special education needs.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1854.0) |
|    1858 |  1864 | So if a child is an IEP and we're required by law to meet that IEP,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1858.0) |
|    1864 |  1868 | then if it's anything additional above what we've already programmed with federal dollars                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1864.0) |
|    1868 |  1872 | or local dollars in the budget, we have to come up and pay for all of that too.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1868.0) |
|    1872 |  1876 | We had, I think, about 20-some-odd positions.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1872.0) |
|    1876 |  1880 | And the reason I'm saying it for this year, this is kind of par for the course, right?                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1876.0) |
|    1880 |  1885 | So I think we had about 24 positions, maybe, to go back and look,                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1880.0) |
|    1885 |  1888 | that we had to add to the budget that were not even budgeted.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1885.0) |
|    1888 |  1891 | But over 90% of those were school-based positions,                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1888.0) |
|    1891 |  1898 | like special education teachers, ELL teachers, right, educational assistants.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1891.0) |
|    1898 |  1903 | Typically, that's where we see the increase in staffing.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1898.0) |
|    1903 |  1907 | I know this year the superintendent was pretty clear                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1903.0) |
|    1907 |  1912 | we're not going to add to central office.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1907.0) |
|    1912 |  1916 | And to be blunt, a lot of us submitted proposals that,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1912.0) |
|    1916 |  1918 | hey, gee, we could need a few more teachers.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1916.0) |
|    1918 |  1923 | Or not teachers, but staff, you know, to do this, to do that, to do this.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1918.0) |

|    1928 |  1930 | is to fund those at the school level.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1928.0) |
|    1930 |  1933 | And that's what we did.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1930.0) |

|    1936 |  1939 | because kids get more individual attention.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1936.0) |

|    2177 |  2179 | And I've had that.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2177.0) |

|    2180 |  2182 | It is absolutely 100% nuts.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2180.0) |
|    2182 |  2187 | And then I've been in a classroom where I've had 20 students.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2182.0) |
|    2187 |  2189 | And, of course, that's more manageable.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2187.0) |
|    2189 |  2194 | So, you know, it all depends on where those extra positions are going.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2189.0) |
|    2194 |  2197 | And more than likely, I don't want to speak for the school system,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2194.0) |
|    2197 |  2200 | I would assume that it's going to those places,                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2197.0) |
|    2200 |  2205 | those schools that are more populated than others to actually, in fact,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2200.0) |
|    2205 |  2207 | lower that student to teacher ratio.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2205.0) |
|    2207 |  2212 | Because it is a hard thing to do in general.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2207.0) |
|    2212 |  2215 | And then when you have so many students in one class,                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2212.0) |
|    2215 |  2218 | it is a lot harder to actually meet those individual needs.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2215.0) |
|    2218 |  2224 | And so I do know from experience that that tends to be the placement for                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2218.0) |
|    2224 |  2226 | those extra positions.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2224.0) |
|    2226 |  2228 | That kind of goes to my point, though,                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2226.0) |
|    2228 |  2233 | because over nine years we've had basically flat amount of students.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2228.0) |
|    2233 |  2236 | So, in theory, what you're saying should be resolved.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2233.0) |
|    2236 |  2240 | If we give you 54% more money over a nine-year period,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2236.0) |
|    2240 |  2243 | shouldn't our children be getting better attention?                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2240.0) |
|    2243 |  2247 | Shouldn't there no longer be 35-person classrooms if we've given you a                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2243.0) |
|    2247 |  2250 | 54% increase with the same amount of kids?                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2247.0) |
|    2250 |  2253 | The common sense tells me if I give you an extra $150 million,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2250.0) |
|    2253 |  2255 | you could find a couple teachers to hire.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2253.0) |
|    2255 |  2258 | So I'd like to know that we hired a couple teachers is all I'm asking.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2255.0) |
|    2258 |  2263 | So I think there should be a considerable amount more now than there                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2258.0) |

|    2265 |  2268 | If you have $150 million more or however many, $200 million,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2265.0) |
|    2268 |  2271 | there you go, $230 million more,                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2268.0) |
|    2271 |  2276 | I would hope we could pay some teachers to come work for us.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2271.0) |

|    2286 |  2288 | Before I ask my school question,                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2286.0) |
|    2288 |  2293 | it seems like we're just starting to get into the meat of the budget,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2288.0) |

|    2295 |  2299 | there's no statutory requirement that we actually have that meeting.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2295.0) |

|    2344 |  2348 | I think there's probably some perspective here that you could share.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2344.0) |

|    2349 |  2353 | perhaps we were underfunding things before and now we're funding them at                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2349.0) |

|    2357 |  2362 | in the last year to understand where the school system has come from over                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2357.0) |
|    2363 |  2365 | the last, you know, 10 to 20 years,                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2363.0) |

|    2368 |  2371 | from an educator all the way to the leader of the school system.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2368.0) |
|    2371 |  2373 | And then where you're planning on taking it.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2371.0) |
|    2373 |  2377 | Could you shed some light on kind of just the general discussion and,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2373.0) |
|    2377 |  2382 | and maybe what we're trying to do and why that requires additional funding.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2377.0) |
|    2382 |  2386 | No, thank you, commissioner Jay. That's actually why I was moving down.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2382.0) |
|    2386 |  2389 | So thanks for, for bringing me up. Cause I do think,                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2386.0) |
|    2389 |  2392 | I do think positioning this a little bit differently. I mean,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2389.0) |
|    2392 |  2394 | the questions you all are asking are great questions,                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2392.0) |
|    2394 |  2398 | kind of comparing every year over year to itself.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2394.0) |
|    2398 |  2402 | But I think it's important to note that a couple of things I'll go back to                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2398.0) |
|    2402 |  2404 | one to commissioner Jay's point.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2402.0) |
|    2404 |  2406 | And I think this is what commissioner Hill was trying to make the point of                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2404.0) |
|    2406 |  2410 | as well. Years ago, 10 years ago, roughly,                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2406.0) |
|    2410 |  2413 | there was a movement by the state to start an RTI,                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2410.0) |
|    2413 |  2415 | which was a, was a response to intervention,                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2413.0) |
|    2416 |  2418 | which meant every student not perform.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2416.0) |
|    2418 |  2421 | We were going to assess students if they weren't performing a certain level,                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2418.0) |
|    2421 |  2425 | we then we're going to provide so much intervention with them daily.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2421.0) |
|    2425 |  2428 | Some kids 30 minutes a day, some kids 45 minutes a day. It's great.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2425.0) |
|    2428 |  2432 | It's the right thing to do for every student who's behind the earlier we catch                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2428.0) |
|    2432 |  2433 | them, the better it is, right?                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2432.0) |
|    2433 |  2436 | The gaps are smallest when they're in first grade and kindergarten,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2433.0) |
|    2436 |  2439 | and they are that time they get to high school. So that was great.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2436.0) |
|    2439 |  2441 | We started assessing those students 10 years ago.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2439.0) |

|    2452 |  2455 | We've continued to put that the duct tape that together over the last decade.                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2452.0) |
|    2455 |  2458 | And I think what we've continued to push in,                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2455.0) |
|    2458 |  2463 | at least my time in Knox County schools is we need more of the funding from                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2458.0) |

|    2465 |  2468 | there's a lot of unfunded mandates to things like intervention that we never                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2465.0) |
|    2469 |  2472 | had the chance to do. I think Governor Lee, this time,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2469.0) |
|    2472 |  2474 | I think one time that we get intervention dollars,                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2472.0) |
|    2474 |  2477 | Governor Haslam did one time a small amount of dollars to put toward it was                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2474.0) |
|    2477 |  2480 | not reoccurring after that. And then I think, so,                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2477.0) |
|    2480 |  2483 | so what we've seen with Governor Lee this time is the investment in the                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2480.0) |

|    2488 |  2491 | And so I think the state finally did ante up with the new,                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2488.0) |

|    2502 |  2504 | We now will have a chance to do these kinds of things.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2502.0) |
|    2504 |  2507 | So, you know, when you look at our third grade literacy rate,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2504.0) |
|    2507 |  2511 | we're the highest of the five major metropolitan areas,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2507.0) |
|    2511 |  2514 | but we're still between 35 and 40%, right?                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2511.0) |
|    2514 |  2516 | And to Commissioner Hill's point,                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2514.0) |
|    2516 |  2519 | now with the new legislation in place about third grade retention,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2516.0) |
|    2519 |  2522 | that means about 60% of our third graders have the potential to get                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2519.0) |
|    2522 |  2525 | retained, right? You've heard that from your constituents.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2522.0) |
|    2525 |  2528 | We've heard that from ours as well. People who are asking those questions.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2525.0) |
|    2528 |  2530 | Again, with that, what do you do?                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2528.0) |

|    2535 |  2537 | but that goes away next year, right?                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2535.0) |
|    2537 |  2539 | We have one more year of that left and then,                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2537.0) |
|    2539 |  2541 | but the law didn't change, right?                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2539.0) |
|    2541 |  2543 | So we still have to have those levels of support for students.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2541.0) |
|    2543 |  2546 | We actually now are looking, you've seen some of that work into pre-K,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2543.0) |

|    2548 |  2551 | That's the real uncharted land where we have to make that difference                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2548.0) |
|    2552 |  2555 | because third grade is almost too late when you take that first assessment.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2552.0) |

|    2558 |  2560 | but really we should be looking back into our pre-K,                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2558.0) |

|    2725 |  2731 | increased cost of non-salary expenditures and then you add to that                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2725.0) |

|    2738 |  2742 | probably surprisingly close to that 54% number in ten years.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2738.0) |

|    2819 |  2821 | Well, that's not when you make a graduate, right?                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2819.0) |
|    2821 |  2825 | It goes back to that's a 13-year culmination of the work, and it's                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2821.0) |
|    2825 |  2826 | the same thing.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2825.0) |
|    2826 |  2829 | Third grade, there's nothing magic in a kid's head that clicks in                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2826.0) |
|    2829 |  2830 | third grade.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2829.0) |
|    2830 |  2832 | There's a lot of kids who can read prior to kindergarten and moving                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2830.0) |
|    2832 |  2833 | on.                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2832.0) |
|    2833 |  2836 | So it is getting those individualized interventions to that level so                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2833.0) |
|    2836 |  2838 | that it does pay off in the end.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2836.0) |
|    2838 |  2842 | And so putting resource there matters and, yeah, we'll take anything                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2838.0) |
|    2842 |  2843 | the state will give us.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2842.0) |
|    2843 |  2844 | That always helps.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2843.0) |
|    2844 |  2845 | So thank you.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2844.0) |
|    2845 |  2847 | Commissioner Oster?                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2845.0) |
|    2847 |  2853 | Well, Commissioner Daley took my comment about TAs.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2847.0) |
|    2853 |  2857 | You and I actually discussed it in the training that I had when I came                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2853.0) |
|    2857 |  2859 | on as commissioner, and I'm going to show my age.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2857.0) |
|    2859 |  2865 | But my oldest is 31, and throughout the boys going through school, they                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2859.0) |
|    2865 |  2867 | all had TAs in the classroom.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2865.0) |
|    2867 |  2869 | Some of them got lucky enough to have two.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2867.0) |
|    2869 |  2873 | And so when you're talking about kids that can't read on the level,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2869.0) |
|    2873 |  2876 | they're struggling with math, whatever the issue is, when you                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2873.0) |
|    2876 |  2880 | actually have a TA and that teacher now, like Commissioner Durrett                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2876.0) |
|    2880 |  2884 | said, if a teacher is trying to teach to the top, the bottom, and                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2880.0) |
|    2884 |  2891 | everywhere in between at 35 or even at 20, if you have another person in                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2884.0) |
|    2891 |  2894 | that classroom, that's where it matters.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2891.0) |
|    2894 |  2896 | That's where the rubber hits the road.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2894.0) |
|    2896 |  2901 | And so as much as I appreciate the school systems initiatives of                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2896.0) |
|    2901 |  2905 | academies and this kind of stuff, I think we're getting away from the                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2901.0) |
|    2905 |  2912 | actual importance of having more people in the classroom for these kids.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2905.0) |
|    2912 |  2917 | And I know that I've heard from some parents that, you know, I lived at                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2912.0) |
|    2917 |  2920 | the school more than I was at home.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2917.0) |
|    2920 |  2924 | And I don't think the parents are utilized near as much as they used to                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2920.0) |
|    2924 |  2927 | be for whatever reason that is now.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2924.0) |
|    2927 |  2933 | So the environment has changed totally from when mine were there.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2927.0) |
|    2934 |  2938 | But mine also graduated on time, and they were reading on schedule,                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2934.0) |
|    2938 |  2940 | and they graduated college.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2938.0) |
|    2940 |  2945 | And, you know, that had something to do with, obviously, parental support,                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2940.0) |
|    2945 |  2949 | but it had to do with teachers and the TAs in there being able to help                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2945.0) |
|    2949 |  2951 | them on that small level.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2949.0) |
|    2951 |  2954 | So I would hope to see if we're going to hire some more people, and I                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2951.0) |

|    2958 |  2962 | And we're not paying these people a ton of money, which is another issue.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2958.0) |
|    2963 |  2968 | But I just think that we need to really gear that back up and get those                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2963.0) |
|    2968 |  2971 | classrooms full again with some help for the teachers.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2968.0) |
|    2971 |  2972 | Thank you, Commissioner.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2971.0) |
|    2972 |  2973 | I just want to say this, too.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2972.0) |
|    2973 |  2976 | I know Mr. McPherson said that that was a commitment of ours in this                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2973.0) |
|    2976 |  2979 | budget, not to add, but to add to the classroom.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2976.0) |
|    2979 |  2983 | And so, like the academy structures that we've gone to and the eight                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2979.0) |
|    2983 |  2987 | high schools that have done that, there have been we didn't change our                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2983.0) |
|    2987 |  2989 | staffing formula for that.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2987.0) |
|    2989 |  2992 | So we did it on the existing staffing formula that we had last year.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2989.0) |
|    2992 |  2996 | There are two positions at those high schools that are federally funded                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2992.0) |
|    2996 |  2997 | that we've put into those.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2996.0) |
|    2997 |  3001 | So that wasn't an extra spend into those schools to do that.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2997.0) |
|    3001 |  3004 | Our teaching assistants, and even I would put tutors in that same boat,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3001.0) |
|    3004 |  3007 | and now that's a requirement by the state as one of the ways for students                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3004.0) |
|    3007 |  3010 | not to be retained.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3007.0) |
|    3010 |  3013 | Well, that ratio has to be one to three, which is great, right?                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3010.0) |
|    3013 |  3016 | But one to three is a lot of tutors that we have to have.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3013.0) |
|    3017 |  3020 | So they'll make kind of an hourly or it could be potentially close to                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3017.0) |

|    3021 |  3025 | But we understand that, too, and that's why in this budget that our                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3021.0) |

|    3029 |  3033 | dollars to try to fill some of the gaps that we have in not having those                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3029.0) |

|    3034 |  3036 | We have vacant positions for teaching assistants.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3034.0) |
|    3036 |  3039 | So we know how important they are, and every school who has those knows                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3036.0) |
|    3039 |  3040 | how important that is.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3039.0) |
|    3040 |  3043 | So for us to continue to have a competitive wage for them as well is                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3040.0) |
|    3043 |  3044 | important.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3043.0) |
|    3044 |  3045 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3044.0) |

|    3046 |  3049 | I guess I will now go into my questions for Mr. Caldwell.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3046.0) |
|    3049 |  3052 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3049.0) |
|    3052 |  3058 | Chris, I've got a few for you.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3052.0) |
|    3058 |  3063 | The first one is, why did we move money in Will Tax to Engineering and                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3058.0) |
|    3063 |  3066 | PW Fund?                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3063.0) |
|    3066 |  3068 | Yeah, so can you hear me?                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3066.0) |
|    3068 |  3069 | Yes.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3068.0) |
|    3069 |  3070 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3069.0) |
|    3070 |  3072 | So we'll talk about that a little bit.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3070.0) |
|    3073 |  3083 | We moved 900,000 from schools to Engineering and Public Works.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3073.0) |
|    3083 |  3088 | Basically, if you ever read the ordinance that passed on Will Tax,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3083.0) |
|    3088 |  3091 | it's very broad on what it can be used for.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3088.0) |
|    3091 |  3096 | And so Commissioner Schoonmaker came to schools and thought it would be a                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3091.0) |
|    3096 |  3099 | good idea if some of this went towards Engineering and Public Works.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3096.0) |
|    3099 |  3101 | They agreed.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3099.0) |
|    3101 |  3105 | And so we moved half of their funding of that toward Engineering and                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3101.0) |
|    3105 |  3110 | Public Works, kept half at General Purpose School Fund,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3105.0) |
|    3110 |  3117 | but tied it to the Mayor's Reading Program and the Elevate Program.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3110.0) |
|    3117 |  3119 | And so that's what that is still there for.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3117.0) |
|    3119 |  3121 | And so that's tied to that.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3119.0) |
|    3121 |  3124 | And then the other is tied to Engineering,                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3121.0) |
|    3124 |  3126 | which helped to increase their budget.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3124.0) |
|    3126 |  3127 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3126.0) |

|    3129 |  3138 | since we've now taken over on the Government Law Library,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3129.0) |
|    3138 |  3141 | what's included in the Government Law Library budget?                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3138.0) |
|    3141 |  3144 | And does it take into account what the Personnel Committee's changes have                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3141.0) |

|    3145 |  3146 | Sure.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3145.0) |
|    3146 |  3149 | That's a really good, cool question.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3146.0) |
|    3149 |  3154 | As we looked at the budget for Government Law Library,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3149.0) |
|    3154 |  3157 | it was two months ago, three months ago.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3154.0) |
|    3157 |  3160 | So it still includes the funding of a position.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3157.0) |
|    3160 |  3164 | And so we know currently it's vacant.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3160.0) |
|    3164 |  3166 | So that can go away.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3164.0) |
|    3166 |  3170 | So as the Personnel Committee decides how to handle Government Law                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3166.0) |

|    3171 |  3175 | we can amend that budget to bring that budget down on the revenue and                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3171.0) |
|    3175 |  3176 | expense side.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3175.0) |
|    3176 |  3177 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3176.0) |
|    3177 |  3183 | You were talking about the 8% raise for KCSO.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3177.0) |
|    3183 |  3185 | That was Captain and Below.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3183.0) |
|    3185 |  3191 | And does that budget include the 8% raise,                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3185.0) |
|    3191 |  3196 | even though the Sheriff declined to delete the vacant positions,                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3191.0) |
|    3196 |  3198 | the 58 positions?                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3196.0) |
|    3198 |  3199 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3198.0) |
|    3199 |  3201 | So, yes.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3199.0) |
|    3201 |  3203 | So what's in, so the,                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3201.0) |
|    3203 |  3208 | so the Mayor Norwood County Commission by TCA code can take away                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3203.0) |
|    3208 |  3212 | positions from, from the Sheriff's office.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3208.0) |
|    3213 |  3218 | And so the Sheriff did turn in a budget request asking for a 30%                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3213.0) |
|    3218 |  3221 | raise for Captain and Below, 10% raise for                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3218.0) |

|    3229 |  3235 | But in doing so, we also volunteered to delete 58 vacant positions.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3229.0) |
|    3235 |  3240 | And so those positions are still on this budget and funded at the                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3235.0) |

|    3248 |  3251 | you propose, we can delete those, those 58 positions.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3248.0) |
|    3251 |  3255 | So, but we budgeted as if they were still in there.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3251.0) |

|    3266 |  3271 | And so I think it was 50 corrections and eight patrol.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3266.0) |

|    3283 |  3287 | Does the Sheriff have a maintenance of effort calculation like education?                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3283.0) |
|    3290 |  3294 | Yes. So there, if I had my, my CTAS book, I would tell you,                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3290.0) |
|    3294 |  3299 | there are three or four maintenance of effort calculations that we do every                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3294.0) |

|    3309 |  3313 | There's at least three and they're all kinds of different.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3309.0) |
|    3316 |  3320 | The schools, as we've talked about is based off recurring revenue.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3316.0) |
|    3321 |  3323 | Sheriff's offices.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3321.0) |
|    3325 |  3327 | I have to look to see what that's based off of, but there's,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3325.0) |
|    3327 |  3331 | I know it's based off of positions and we have to turn,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3327.0) |
|    3331 |  3332 | we have to turn the report annually,                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3331.0) |
|    3332 |  3336 | but there is a maintenance of effort calculation for the Sheriff's office.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3332.0) |
|    3336 |  3337 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3336.0) |
|    3337 |  3342 | And I was going to ask you what other MOE calculations do we abide by?                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3337.0) |
|    3342 |  3343 | One for EPW for sure.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3342.0) |
|    3343 |  3348 | And it means that you can't decrease what your funding roads for every year.                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3343.0) |
|    3349 |  3351 | And the last question is,                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3349.0) |
|    3351 |  3355 | I noticed we're purchasing 47 vehicles for the Sheriff. Is this adequate?                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3351.0) |
|    3357 |  3361 | I would defer to Alison on adequate. I think ultimately,                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3357.0) |
|    3361 |  3366 | I can't remember what the proposal was. I'll let Alison answer that.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3361.0) |

|    3393 |  3397 | Upon our initial proposal was around 60 vehicles.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3393.0) |
|    3398 |  3403 | Chris did allow, I believe it's 47 out of the capital budget.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3398.0) |
|    3403 |  3407 | And what we do is if we have surplus funds at the end of the year,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3403.0) |
|    3407 |  3411 | then we come to commission and ask to use those surplus funds to buy the                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3407.0) |

|    3416 |  3417 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3416.0) |
|    3417 |  3421 | But the 47 vehicles could be used in excess funds in the Sheriff's budget of                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3417.0) |

|    3895 |  3898 | And it would have been funded at about $800,000.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3895.0) |
|    3898 |  3900 | I think it was about eight or eight 50.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3898.0) |
|    3900 |  3901 | That seems about right.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3900.0) |
|    3901 |  3907 | And so ultimately the mayor's plural county mayor and city mayor met with                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3901.0) |

|    4544 |  4555 | That's our mechanism that we use to to support the,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4544.0) |

|    4557 |  4559 | And so by TCA code,                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4557.0) |
|    4559 |  4562 | they get 40% of hotel motel tax.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4559.0) |
|    4562 |  4566 | So 40% of 10.5 is 4.2 million.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4562.0) |
|    4566 |  4568 | So we,                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4566.0) |
|    4568 |  4572 | so they get that 4.2 million based off the breakout.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4568.0) |
|    4572 |  4577 | So technically it's 40% for the direct promotion of tourism,                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4572.0) |

|    4594 |  4598 | And so a lot of our expense on that goes to the convention center,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4594.0) |

|    4599 |  4605 | Then we also pay about 1.2 or 3 million to the agency history center,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4599.0) |

|    4613 |  4618 | So they can utilize that for tourism related expenses.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4613.0) |
|    4618 |  4622 | And then we keep 10% for the same thing that the city has.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4618.0) |

|    4664 |  4665 | My question.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4664.0) |

|    4669 |  4671 | And I think I've already talked to you about this.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4669.0) |
|    4671 |  4672 | There was an increase in your budget.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4671.0) |
|    4672 |  4674 | And from my understanding,                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4672.0) |
|    4674 |  4677 | that was four or 5% salary increase.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4674.0) |

|    4884 |  4886 | Ultimately there was,                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4884.0) |
|    4886 |  4887 | there was,                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4886.0) |
|    4887 |  4890 | and this goes back to,                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4887.0) |
|    4890 |  4892 | this is six or seven years ago.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4890.0) |
|    4892 |  4896 | And we try to get them to change what ultimately,                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4892.0) |
|    4896 |  4897 | if you ever want to get into it,                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4896.0) |
|    4897 |  4900 | there was a retention pond in the middle.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4897.0) |
|    4900 |  4903 | And we think somebody at the state thought it was manmade.                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4900.0) |
|    4903 |  4904 | And this,                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4903.0) |
|    4904 |  4905 | you had to go around it and said you could,                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4904.0) |
|    4905 |  4906 | you didn't have to,                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4905.0) |
|    4906 |  4907 | you could go straight.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4906.0) |
|    4907 |  4910 | And so we're going to have to redesign the whole park because of that.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4907.0) |
|    4910 |  4912 | So probably what you're referring to.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4910.0) |
|    4912 |  4914 | Is that partnership really paying off for us?                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4912.0) |
|    4915 |  4919 | I think ultimately it's this.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4915.0) |
|    4919 |  4923 | If I think once Pellissippi Parkway extension happens,                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4919.0) |
|    4923 |  4926 | and then that park gets to fill out and you have residential in there and you                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4923.0) |
|    4926 |  4929 | have more businesses,                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4926.0) |
|    4929 |  4930 | then we,                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4929.0) |
|    4930 |  4933 | we get 25% of property tax from that,                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4930.0) |
|    4933 |  4935 | that that that will pay for that.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4933.0) |
|    4935 |  4938 | So I think over time it can.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4935.0) |
|    4938 |  4942 | I think one of the big issues that we've had early on is it was built and                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4938.0) |
|    4942 |  4943 | opened right at the,                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4942.0) |
|    4943 |  4946 | at right at the beginning of the great recession.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4943.0) |
|    4946 |  4948 | So getting anything to go was hard.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4946.0) |
|    4948 |  4950 | And then not knowing what the state was going to do with,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4948.0) |
|    4950 |  4953 | with Pellissippi Parkway has been a challenge.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4950.0) |
|    4953 |  4954 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4953.0) |
|    4954 |  4960 | And I think Knox County paid way many millions more than what county did.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4954.0) |
|    4960 |  4961 | Correct.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4960.0) |
|    4961 |  4962 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4961.0) |

|    5089 |  5090 | Why that year is,                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5089.0) |

|    5092 |  5095 | but you take this year minus that year and do the calculation and they                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5092.0) |
