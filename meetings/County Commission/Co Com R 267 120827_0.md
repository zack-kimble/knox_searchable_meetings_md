| 0:01:09| If you are here today to appear before this county commission and give testimony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=69)|
| 0:01:13| please stand, raise your right hand, and be sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=73)|
| 0:01:16| Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you'll give today will be the truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=76)|
| 0:01:20| the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=80)|

| 0:01:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. They have been so sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=83)|

| 0:01:31| which is Cargo Oil Incorporated on Maynardville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=91)|
| 0:01:34| It is first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=94)|
| 0:01:36| Do we have the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| Not applicant, but the individual with cargo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=99)|
| 0:01:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| Good afternoon, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| Please state your name for the record and your business address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| My name is Jim Peery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| Our business address is Cargo Oil Company Incorporated at 7025 Maynardville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=108)|
| 0:01:53| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| What our procedure here is today when there is, in fact, an allegation of a violation, we hear from the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=116)|
| 0:02:01| The officer then states what he believes to be the facts, and you can either admit or deny that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=121)|
| 0:02:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| If you will, Officer Mayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=127)|
| 0:02:13| On June 27, 2012, I sent an underage minor into Cargo Oil Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=133)|
| 0:02:19| 7025 Maynardville Highway, and they bought a six-pack of Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=139)|
| 0:02:25| Just state your name and title for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| Captain Alan May, Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=149)|
| 0:02:33| Sir, did you hear the allegation from the officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=153)|
| 0:02:36| Yes, sir, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| You admit or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| We admit that, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Do you have any testimony you'd like to give the commission before they examine your case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| The young lady who sold it had been employed less than two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| She was terminated, and so was the manager at the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| There was no evidence that the manager had given this young lady any training whatsoever, and she lost her job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=176)|
| 0:03:04| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=186)|
| 0:03:07| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| I've said in the past I'm not a big proponent of just firing folks, just the other managers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=191)|
| 0:03:18| just because, but I do appreciate what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| I mean, she was fired for cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| I mean, there was, again, obvious, sounds like obvious evidence that she had a job to do to prepare this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=204)|
| 0:03:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| And she failed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| And I say she because that's what I think you indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| It must have been a female.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| She had been with us for 14 years, sir, but she admitted to not giving the young lady any training whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=217)|
| 0:03:44| She left it up to the other night shift girls to train this young woman, and it's not their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| It's the manager's responsibility to train her employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| So is there anything that you're doing to ensure that your new employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| and I'm sure there's a turnover that they're being properly brought up to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| Well, the new manager had 16 years of experience with Burger King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| Most of the training he had was in training the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| It hit not only his store but various stores in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=254)|
| 0:04:20| It all comes down to training, and that's all it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| As far as I know, it's still the state law that you require I.D. for the sale of any alcohol products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=263)|
| 0:04:30| and that was not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| Make a motion, $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| Or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| Or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| Or suspension, but your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| Motion's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| Sir, what the commission just did, they're giving you a choice within the confines of our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| You can either pay a $500 fine within seven days to the county clerk or suffer a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| It's your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| Very good, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| Next, we have our applications, and for those of you who are here for applications, should you be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| we have a representative here from the Metropolitan Drug Commission who will be happy to give you some information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| and if you would pick up a packet from her before you leave, she's seated back in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| Clerk, item 6A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| Waggles, Stores Incorporated, Waggles, 1000 Ebenezer Road, off-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| That's the applicant here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| If you could give us your name and address for the record, please, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| Ken McMullen, Post Office Box 650, Powell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| Good afternoon, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| You're the representative for Waggles, Incorporated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| I'm going to ask you a series of questions, sir, on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| I'll ask you to answer out loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| I'll exclude a lot of the questions because it's my understanding you have not built this site yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| I'll dispense with asking you questions about prior location, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=354)|
| 0:06:01| Now, have you had anyone at this point that you've selected that will probably run the operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=361)|
| 0:06:10| At this time, we have a subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| We move our managers around into different stores when we open them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| We promote them into higher volume new stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| All right, because generally what we will do is ask you if the employees at that location have ever been convicted of a crime, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| But at this point, obviously, your current staff would not fall into that category, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| And this is going to be for off-premises only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| It's a corporate store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| Are you familiar with the Knox County and Tennessee Bureau Laws and Regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| and do you agree to conduct your business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| I assume, of course, the person who will run this store will have a server permit license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| That's all the questions I'll ask you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| I'm now going to defer to our staff, health department, sheriff's department, codes, fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=417)|
| 0:07:08| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| Fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| Or do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=435)|

| 0:24:55| as chair and to serve Knox County. As I said, when I accepted the position two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| years ago, I would serve one year, and if you thought I did a good job, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| serve a second year, and then I would seek no more positions, and I wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| do what I said I would do. But I have enjoyed serving you, and I look forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| to serving under the leadership of the next individual that you will select as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=1510)|

| 0:26:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair. You know, in the vein of you never know what the day may bring, I had a pretty interesting Saturday. I ended up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=1593)|
| 0:26:43| waking up, and I shared this with a good friend of mine, Mary Linda Schwarzbart. I woke up Saturday, and it was a great day. By midnight of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=1603)|

| 0:27:26| family, floated down a river, got in a fight, but not much else, not much detail of his life, what may have in Hebrew Bible marked him for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=1646)|
| 0:27:37| greatness. His first encounter with God is auspicious. He sees a bush burn, but not be consumed, and is curious enough to wonder why. And as he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=1657)|
| 0:27:52| approaches, the book of Exodus tells us, God tells him to remove the sandals from his feet. That's his very first command in his commission as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=1672)|
| 0:28:03| leader. Why? Why no shoes in holy service? Centuries later, a sage in medieval Europe suggested that what happens when you wear sandals is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=1683)|
| 0:28:21| that you can't feel pebbles or thorns. Your feet are immune to the pains of the road, and a leader of each generation has to feel the sorrows and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=1701)|
| 0:28:34| sufferings in every stumbling block along the way. My charge for you, my prayer today, is that God look over us in God's mercy and justice, and remind us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=1714)|
| 0:28:47| what it feels to be without shoes, figuratively and literally, that we remember those we are called to serve, those who elected us, those whose passions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=1727)|
| 0:28:59| concerns animated us to seek higher office, to seek leadership roles, that we never, even in our suits and ties when we come together for meetings and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=1739)|
| 0:29:09| important decisions, forget those who suffer and struggle and stumble along the way, and that God look over us and grant us compassion and a long memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=1749)|

| 0:39:16| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| Just one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| I'm still abstaining on 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| The consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| Without any objection, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| Can I make just one comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| Yes, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| This item was on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| I gave each one of you all one of these maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| Legacy Parks Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| I'll get my tongue tangled behind my tooth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| Legacy Parks Foundation last week had a grand opening of the last part of their urban wilderness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2384)|
| 0:39:51| hiking and biking trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| I believe Carol is now 35 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| And those of you who have not seen the article, I'm not pushing any one paper over another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| but pick an article in the Metropulse outside and see what a prize we have in Carol Evans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2402)|
| 0:40:10| and what she's been able to do for our park system and other events around this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| I'm proud of our city for it and proud of Carol for what she's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| But this last loop was opened up last week, so it's now ready to use, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| Come on across the river and join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| Thank you, Carol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| Without objection, I would like to discuss the items with regards to the teacher survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| There are two items on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| And the reason I'd like to do that is we have something very, very special that the schools are going to need to leave for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| There's an announcement in about an hour that's coming out of Nashville, which we can't talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| It's embargoed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| But while they're here, I thought we would go ahead and discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| As I mentioned in the chairman's lunch, I was talking with Mr. Deakins, who is chair of the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2452)|
| 0:40:58| and in reviewing our retreat, we had said that if there was an issue where the two bodies could not necessarily agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2458)|
| 0:41:08| or needed further discussion, that we would meet and discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| And so in our discussions, he suggested that perhaps they form a subcommittee of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2472)|
| 0:41:19| We have a subcommittee of the commission to meet, talk about the survey, how it would be implemented, reach an agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| and then bring back to both bodies what their results were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| The people that the school board members that Mr. Deakins has appointed are Karen Carson, Lynn Fugate, and Pam Treanor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2491)|
| 0:41:38| I feel that if you decide that you would like to do this and have these two groups meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| I think Commissioner Norman obviously would be one to put on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| And if there's any other commissioners that would like to be appointed to that, I'll be happy to take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2506)|
| 0:41:53| And if not, I'll be happy to appoint somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| But I guess first of all is I need to have a feel from you if you feel that this is how you would like to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2516)|
| 0:42:03| I would like to recommend that we proceed and do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| I suppose one thing that might facilitate the discussion is to take up the resolution that I proposed also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2528)|
| 0:42:19| And if it passes, then there won't really be any need for any further discussion as to the formation of that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2539)|
| 0:42:30| So what about that as far as the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| You want to make that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| I would like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| Is there a second on Commissioner Norman's resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| First of all, let's read that into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| Clerk, if you would read Commissioner Norman's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| It's number 914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| This is a resolution recommending that a teacher satisfaction survey be contracted and conducted by a third-party consulting firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2565)|
| 0:42:54| not associated with Knox County Schools or Knox County Government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| specializing in such employee surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| And said survey should ensure absolute and an enemy of all participants with reporting and conclusions drawn by said third party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2580)|
| 0:43:13| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| As we've talked about a couple of times now, the problem seems to be with a sense that a survey by either the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2595)|
| 0:43:27| or the school board is one that's going to have some attachments to it for teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2607)|
| 0:43:34| And so what I would like to see is just an opportunity for us to step back from that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2614)|
| 0:43:42| and see if we could contract a company such as this and have a survey done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2622)|
| 0:43:54| And then that way, I think with proper process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| teachers will be free to respond with certainty that there's not going to be anything held against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2639)|
| 0:44:12| And also by being outside of the school system or county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2652)|
| 0:44:20| I just want to try to provide an avenue for them to feel like there's just not going to be any fear involved of something happening to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2660)|
| 0:44:36| They can be frank in their evaluations of strategies and processes and procedures that are taking place right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2676)|
| 0:44:45| And I think the school system has attempted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| They had an online survey, I believe, last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| But I just don't think that teachers in those situations will respond in total frankness about what they really feel about what's taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2696)|
| 0:45:09| So I hope that you'll consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| And I don't know anything about timeline or when this would be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2712)|
| 0:45:19| but I would anticipate from my discussions with some individuals that are interested in both funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2719)|
| 0:45:28| and pursuing this process that this could be done within a matter of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2728)|
| 0:45:36| So we're not talking about something that's way down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| I support most of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2743)|
| 0:45:49| I don't want to speak for the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| Hopefully they'll come down and speak for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| But I'm sure that if they wouldn't have a problem using an outside entity, that would be, I think, most appropriate, not associated with either bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2753)|
| 0:46:02| I guess the term that concerns me is that absolute anonymity term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2762)|
| 0:46:10| Those of us that tend to want to watch Law and Order and CSI, that's a pretty difficult thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2770)|
| 0:46:19| And as the crazy guy over at the university hacked into Sir Palin's email, he probably never thought he was going to be caught in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2779)|
| 0:46:32| So the term absolute anonymity, I think, puts us in a vulnerable position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2792)|
| 0:46:39| If someone finds out a name through no fault of the company, they've got nice safeguards and firewalls, but, you know, things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2799)|
| 0:46:48| And if something gets out, I would hate for us to say, no, it's absolute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| There's nothing on the other side of absolute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| So I think if we could maybe tone down that rhetoric a little bit, say that there will be an anonymous survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2815)|
| 0:47:05| We'll make every attempt to keep the participants' names in confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2825)|
| 0:47:14| But, you know, when you're dealing with email, I mean, it's an electronic system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| And if there's a way in for you, there's a way for another person to get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| And so I guess that's my only issue with this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2842)|
| 0:47:29| Again, I support everything that you said in terms of ensuring that, one, that we'll get good data back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2849)|
| 0:47:36| I mean, if they're concerned about someone finding out their supervisor or someone else, I do agree that it will be hard to be open and honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2856)|
| 0:47:44| But I think when we, you know, put that strong of a term in there, it just, it's a little, again, it puts us on guard for accountability in a way that I don't know that that's our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2864)|
| 0:47:58| I mean, if a third party comes out and does that or some, you know, person over in Korea hacks into their systems five years from now, you know, what happens then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2878)|
| 0:48:06| So I don't, I would just ask you to consider that as a concern of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2886)|
| 0:48:14| What if you just added make every effort to ensure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| Yeah, something like that I think would be perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| Yeah, I just had one comment, and it gets back to what are we going to do with this when we get our information back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2904)|
| 0:48:34| We really aren't charged with making policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| Let's say there are some things that really need to be done with the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| Do we just pass these on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| Are we planning on acting on this, passing resolutions on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| I'm not necessarily opposed to doing it, but it also gets to the, you know, gets back to the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2931)|
| 0:48:58| We've talked about some of this before is what is our role and what is the school board's role?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2938)|
| 0:49:03| What are we going to do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| How are we going to act on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| And, you know, before we do something and spend some money on it, I'd just like to know what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2947)|
| 0:49:16| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| Yeah, I agree with Dr. Briggs somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| I also agree with Commissioner Norman in regards to the fact that having a third party do the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| But I was hoping that the third party survey could come after this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| this joint committee between the two boards got together and talked about the topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| And so I would like to make a substitute motion that we go with the model that we discussed at the retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2976)|
| 0:49:43| having three school board members and three county commissioners meet and discuss the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| And hopefully Commissioner Norman's desire, because I share the same desire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| but I think that we're putting the cart before the horse and hope that we can, hope that will come out of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2992)|
| 0:49:58| But I'd like to make this committee take a few steps first before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| So I'd like to make a substitute motion to form the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| and to hopefully come to the resolution that Commissioner Norman's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| There's a substitute motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| I agree with Brad that I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| And when we were talking about doing the survey before, it was my understanding that it would be anonymous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| We had some discussions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| And it was my understanding that it would be a third party that would come in and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| And I would like for it to go further than just, you know, teacher satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| I think there are a lot of other topics that need to be covered in it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| And we took such good steps together at the retreat that I really want to honor that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3040)|
| 0:50:49| and that agreement that we had that if there were disagreements between the two bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| that we would come together and resolve those instead of trying to hammer each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3054)|
| 0:51:01| So I would like for very much to do this joint task force first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| or joint committee first and see what comes of that before we move on with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| So that's why I'm supporting the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3077)|
| 0:51:18| I'd like to just offer my answer to Dr. Briggs when he asked what will we do with the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3078)|
| 0:51:25| I don't think it's as much as what this body will do with the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| But I think it's this body has a duty to make this information available to the stalwarts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3090)|
| 0:51:39| and the PTAs, those that go to these school board meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| and those that are active in the schools that can have some influence on things that are done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| if there's a problem area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| You know, it takes a community working together to do all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| I'm not saying we need this so that we can dictate anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| And I don't anticipate us trying to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| I think it's a sharing of the problem, as I see it, with the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3123)|
| 0:52:11| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| As to the substitute motion, I'll not be supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3136)|
| 0:52:22| But just the basis being that I think that that will, although you may be able to get some good ideas from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3142)|
| 0:52:33| and maybe it comes to a third-party survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| Okay, that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| But I think that also businesses that do this know what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3159)|
| 0:52:45| That's their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| And as to Ms. Boyle's comments about the satisfaction survey, I don't think she was here for the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3167)|
| 0:52:55| So some of the discussion that took place there, we didn't, she didn't get to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3175)|
| 0:53:03| One of those things is, and also to Mr. McKenzie's comments about absolute anonymity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3183)|
| 0:53:10| of course that's probably an ideal and maybe that isn't a great phrase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| but the anonymity issue was a critical one and it remains a critical one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3194)|
| 0:53:22| And so as well as we could, it would be the type of survey that would be probably using U.S. mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3202)|
| 0:53:32| as much as possible, but there, you know, in the data analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| there certainly would be computers probably involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| and there's always a danger, I guess, in some way when you're using a computer in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| there is a, you know, there's never absolute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| There would not be absolute, I guess, 100% anonymity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| So, but the effort would be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| That is, it would not be an emailed survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| It would not be, that wouldn't be the method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| It would be, it would also be, as far as I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| it would be a survey that was sort of a two-part thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| It would be questions sent out or it would be a query to teachers sent out via the mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3250)|
| 0:54:19| via U.S. Postal Service, about what their concerns are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| and then those concerns would go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| and then a survey would be constructed based on the types of responses they got initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3266)|
| 0:54:35| Then that survey would go back and that would be the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3275)|
| 0:54:40| So, in effect, it's a teacher, it's a survey of the teachers and by the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| They construct the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| The third-party group is the one that puts it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3287)|
| 0:54:53| So, there's all issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| All issues would be on the table for that type of survey, everything that concerns teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3296)|
| 0:55:04| I think also to Dr. Briggs' comments about what you do with the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| I think the information certainly, we don't, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| it would be what does a school, what does a school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| and central office do with the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| They would be the users of the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| That would be up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| But, of course, everybody would have access to the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| after the survey was analyzed and conclusions were drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3327)|
| 0:55:34| So, at the end, I think that we can expedite the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3334)|
| 0:55:42| if we step back and step out of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| and let an independent group take over and see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3346)|
| 0:55:53| Motion on the floor is to form a committee of three commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| to work with three members of the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| to work out details on a teacher's survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| and report back to both bodies on their findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| Let's do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| Let's start in the first district clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3369)|

| 0:57:05| Remaining a pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| Commissioner Wright remains a pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| Seven ayes, three noes, and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| Commissioner Norman, would you be willing to serve on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| Commissioner Broyles, Commissioner Anders, would you agree to serve on this committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| So Commissioner Anders, Norman, and Broyles, if there's no objection, we'll have those three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| And then they will report back to us after they've had that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| I understand they want to meet pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| So we'll probably have the initial meeting here in just a few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3455)|
| 0:57:41| Also, item number 910, we'll withdraw that one because it also has to do with teacher survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| We know that you all like to be teased, so let me give you a tease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| A very important announcement at 315 this afternoon about our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| It is exciting, and we just can't tell you what it is because it is embargoed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| So anyway, just to let you know, and congratulations to our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| because they'll have some really fun news here at 315 that has to do with Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| and it's a statewide announcement being made out of Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| The next item is on page 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| It's resolution 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| It's number 1, appointing an individual recommended by the East Tennessee chapter of the Institute of Internal Auditors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3499)|
| 0:58:26| and an individual recommended by the Knoxville chapter of the Tennessee Society of Certified Public Accountants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| And number 2, reappointing Commissioner Amy Broyles, Commissioner Ed Schaus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| and Commissioner Dave Wright to the Knox County Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| Richard Walls, we do not have names yet on item number 1, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| So item number 1, we will need to bypass that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| But item number 2, do I hear a motion that we reappoint Broyles, Schaus, and Wright to the Audit Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3527)|
| 0:58:53| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3537)|
| 0:58:58| And with the remainder, can we say we'll defer that until next month on item 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| Do we hear a motion that we defer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| I so move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| Let me say something to the members of the Audit Committee and to the Commission, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3546)|
| 0:59:12| We're scheduled to meet in two weeks and two days, and we do not have our two additional members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3552)|
| 0:59:18| so I'm going to suggest we postpone that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| I welcome any comments from Amy or David about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| We're going to schedule it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| Obviously, we're public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| We can schedule it if you have your calendars, and if not, we'll work it out down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| Well, I know that I had a sunshine meeting with Joe Carsello just recently when he announced that he was going to not be able to serve on the Audit Committee anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3575)|
| 0:59:48| And we hope that Mary will be reappointed so he'd be the only person that we would be replacing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3588)|
| 0:59:55| and he has indicated that he would be willing to stay on until we have another person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3595)|
| 1:00:02| And we have things that are ongoing, so I'd rather we just go ahead and meet and have Mary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3602)|
| 1:00:08| in the anticipation that she's going to be reappointed, and have Joe just stay on until we have someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3608)|
| 1:00:16| I would assume their appointments expire in three or four days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3616)|
| 1:00:23| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| Would that be possible, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| Given the circumstance, you can certainly do a temporary appointment until such time as a permanent replacement is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3628)|
| 1:00:36| Since the Audit Committee only meets every other month, I really would hate to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| Would it be fine with me if we can have a full contingency there, and if you have the information that they'll be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3641)|
| 1:00:47| I would do that, though, with a formal motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| Do you think they would go 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| I mean, agree to serve an additional 90?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| It's a move that we have Mary and Dr. Carsello on an interim basis moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| Yeah, an additional 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| Or until the replacements are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| That covers this then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| I second it and concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| Motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3676)|

| 1:01:18| Page 3, Resolution 112.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| It's approving the appointment of Michael Edwards to the Board of Directors of the Development Corporation of the County of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3681)|
| 1:01:28| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| Nothing other than what I said before, and nothing against Mr. Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| I just would like to reiterate that I think that there are many, many capable people in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3699)|
| 1:01:46| businessmen, started businesses, run businesses, and that perspectives, other perspectives, are a very valuable thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3706)|
| 1:01:55| And I would like these boards to consider that when they do their appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3715)|
| 1:02:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3722)|
| 1:02:03| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3727)|

| 1:02:18| Page 7, Resolution 407.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| It's approving a grant award in the amount of $98,416, no local match,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3740)|
| 1:02:26| from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| under the Assistance of Firefighters Grant Program, fire prevention and safety grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3758)|

| 1:02:48| Page 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| Page 12, Resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| It's a resolution respectfully requesting that the Knox County Election Commission reopen the Bell Morris Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3773)|
| 1:03:00| as a voting location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| And I don't think there's anybody here from Bell Morris or the Larry Cox Voting Centers to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3791)|
| 1:03:18| And there's no one from the Election Commission that could be here, which is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| So we can move on through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| And I understand that some of you don't care to vote on this, and that's fine, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| But these are people that I represent who are very concerned with what has happened with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3809)|
| 1:03:36| Election Day is not going to be pleasant at Larry Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| It's a very small polling place, even though it has been renovated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| and there's not adequate parking for even the people who vote there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| I'm disappointed very much so in the way this is handled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| but I'm also very disappointed in what's happened since then with people's behavior on both sides of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3832)|
| 1:04:02| So I certainly understand if someone doesn't want to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| If you choose to vote against it, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| But these are the people that I represent, and this is very important to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| So I'm going to vote in favor of it, and we can do that and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| I can sympathize with Commissioner Brewer's zeal in this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| but the fact is this is kind of like dealing with a school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| We can't tell them what to do, and we'll just be spinning our wheels, wasting our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| We can make suggestions, but we cannot tell them what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| They've made a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| They voted twice to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| So it's out of our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| Amy, do you have any polling data as to how many voted Bill Moore's and how many at the Cox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| What kind of numbers are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| Not off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3893)|
| 1:04:54| but I know that the number that voted Bill Moore's is tremendously greater than the number that votes at Larry Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3894)|
| 1:05:00| The parking at Larry Cox is not even adequate for the number of people who vote there already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3900)|
| 1:05:06| So to move everybody from Bill Moore's to Larry Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| You know, I've heard all the conspiracy theories and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| I think this is just, you know, a mistake or a decision was made in haste without proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3913)|
| 1:05:19| or a recommendation was made in haste without proper research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| And it was a rookie mistake, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| because normally in the past when voting locations had been moved or closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3926)|
| 1:05:32| there has been a great deal of community engagement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| and the community came forward with possibilities of places to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| So, you know, I think the election office is getting ready for their biggest election that they do in four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| and I think they're just busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| I don't think anybody was out to get anybody or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| It's just an unfortunate mistake, and I'm sorry that it's gotten to be the way that it has at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| And I understand everybody's things about, you know, and I understand we can't tell them what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3959)|
| 1:06:05| That's not what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| And the comments about the other people's, you know, issues and whatever, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3967)|
| 1:06:14| everyone up here is more than willing to get into somebody else's sandbox when it suits their purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3974)|
| 1:06:21| So that's, you know, I'm just done with the excuses and with the not doing this or that for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3981)|
| 1:06:32| I just want to speak for my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| These are people that I represent in 16 North and at 16 South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| This isn't just Bill Morris that's being affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| It's the people who voted Larry Cox, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| And I just want to speak for them and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| I don't think we need to beat this to death today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| Let's just vote and move on, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| In your opinion, is this a friendly amendment, sending it to the election commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| Yeah, it's just, you know, please revisit this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| It's going to be a really difficult day at Larry Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4021)|
| 1:07:06| It's going to be a very difficult day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| And it's also going to cause some very difficult days for the election commission in both the day of the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4027)|
| 1:07:14| and the days following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| They're going to get a huge landslide of e-mails and phone calls of people complaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| So it's not helping them any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| As I said on last week, I'm betting that this isn't the last step that the election commission is going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4048)|
| 1:07:38| I do think there's a lot lower hanging fruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| I think Commissioner Brown and I agree to that point, that there's a lot of districts that can be combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4060)|
| 1:07:48| In fact, I was in dialogue with Greg McKay, you know, so that kind of dates it a while ago, about a couple of districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4068)|
| 1:07:57| So I guess what I would like to say here publicly is whether this passes or not, I would ask the election commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4077)|
| 1:08:06| because they're not constituent based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| They're not built for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| They're more, you know, brass tacks, numbers, situations, how to move things around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4091)|
| 1:08:17| But there is a public aspect to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| So I would ask that going forward, if they would just confer with us and we can set the public meetings up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| if they would just kind of engage us early, and then we would probably not have any of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4105)|
| 1:08:31| If we just, you know, that's kind of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| That's what we're good at, getting the message out to our people and our districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| So if they would just engage us when they take these actions that they have to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4119)|
| 1:08:45| You know, these are actions, again, that a lot of places they need to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| This probably, you know, again, may or may not have been one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| But, you know, if they would go forward, going forward, if they would engage us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| So that's the only thing that I would ask for the election commission to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4136)|
| 1:09:03| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| One other thing I wanted to clear up real quickly is that some position on the closing of Bill Morris in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4144)|
| 1:09:12| was attributed to me by one of the election commissioners, and it was reported as part of public record and in the press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4152)|
| 1:09:18| I have not ever advocated for the closure of Bill Morris at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| And, unfortunately, there was an election commissioner who made that statement to the media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| and it was reported, but it was erroneous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| I have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| I was willing to and supported a test run of Greg McKay's convenience voting centers in one election to see how that worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4171)|
| 1:09:41| And I'm hoping that that was simply a misunderstanding of what that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| But I have not supported the closing of Bill Morris at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| The discussion over this has been 100 percent of what we've heard from the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4193)|
| 1:10:01| and from the floor in favor of reopening Bill Morris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4201)|
| 1:10:06| Have we yet to hear anybody from the election commission speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| Has anybody come to us from that side of the debate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4211)|
| 1:10:15| I invited Mr. Rogers to come to our luncheon today, and he told me that the body had voted twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| and that anyone was welcome to contact him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| He didn't want to appear disrespectful to the commission, but he felt that the body had voted and had voted twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| And so he said that he would prefer not to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| If we had any questions, call the individual election commissioners or feel free to call him directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| I invited Cliff as well as all of the election commissioners to come to actually the last week's work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4240)|
| 1:10:47| because I was hoping that that was where the bulk of the discussion was going to take place rather than today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4247)|
| 1:10:54| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| You know, the election commission has a really tough job in finding places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| because they have to find a place that is secure, that those machines can be left overnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4263)|
| 1:11:10| locked up with no access from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| And that's not easy to do in a lot of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| We have this be the third or fourth election in one of my precincts that will be the three different locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4277)|
| 1:11:28| So it's not a, it can be a common problem because of the factors that they have to use to be able to protect the machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4288)|
| 1:11:41| It's not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| Just one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4303)|
| 1:11:47| You know, this is another issue where I feel like this, the election commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4307)|
| 1:11:52| has the authority to make these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| With the uproar that has taken place over this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4315)|
| 1:12:00| I feel sure that they'll automatically reconsider in the future what they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4320)|
| 1:12:07| or reconsider Bell-Morris in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| But I don't have any other than the discussion that's taken place on one side of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4330)|
| 1:12:17| I have to, I just feel like I have to defer to the wisdom and to the efforts of the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4337)|
| 1:12:24| Otherwise, you know, I'm going over them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| So I don't feel capable of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| I don't feel like I have the background to do that in this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| Although I greatly respect Ms. Broyles and Mr. McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4357)|
| 1:12:42| I just feel like I'm, you know, I have to go with the people that have done the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4362)|
| 1:12:47| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| Who all, could you raise your hands on the ayes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| Go two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| All those opposed, no, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| All those opposed, raise your hands so we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| I'm going to be a pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| Let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| We'll do a roll call starting in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4392)|

| 1:13:21| I'll pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4401)|

| 1:13:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4420)|

| 1:13:56| The vote is three yes and four no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| So we do not have a majority, and so the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4438)|
| 1:14:08| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| The next item is on page 13, resolution 909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4452)|
| 1:14:17| It's requesting that the chairman of the Knox County Commission forward a letter to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| Knox County Legislative Delegation requesting that the delegation enact legislation designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| to broaden the eligibility criteria under the Tennessee Property Tax Freeze Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4466)|
| 1:14:33| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| It's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| This is just a, and I would like to ask the delegation to look at this and see if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4478)|
| 1:14:45| any way that more seniors can be covered under the property tax freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| Brad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| This is something that, I'm going to vote for support, but this is one of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| we can bring up on the 27th when we meet with the delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| Yeah, that'd be awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| Commissioner Schaaf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| I just think it's a great idea that Commissioner Burroughs has come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| She came up many times during the debate over the school tax, and I was getting, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4502)|
| 1:15:09| like explaining how to balance the national debt or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| It's just, it's impossible to explain, so I welcome her moving forward with this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4513)|
| 1:15:19| hopefully can educate the citizens who do qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| Mr. Chairman, do we have any figures, or Chris Caldwell, can you come and, what kind of figures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4523)|
| 1:15:29| are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| I don't know where it affects us now, but do you have an idea where you want to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| this, how far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| No, and that's why I left it open-ended to let the, I didn't want to set a particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4534)|
| 1:15:40| percentage or a particular dollar amount or a particular goal because I don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| limit the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| I'd like for us to talk at our legislative luncheon some more about it and would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4546)|
| 1:15:52| to talk to the legislator, let them, give them the opportunity to work with it because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| it's going to have to come from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| So I don't want to hamstring them with too much detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| I'd like to give them the freedom to do what they think is best with this, but just let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| them know that we think it's something important that we'd like them to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| Chris, what is it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| Is it, what, $36,000 is the cutoff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| Is that the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| I would defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| But I would defer to the trustee's office or maybe even Craig O'Hooley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4577)|
| 1:16:23| He may know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| I'm not, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| The cutoff right now is not set at a particular dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| It's set at if you, if a senior citizen makes less than 50% of the average income of all seniors in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4591)|
| 1:16:40| they qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| So it's like Ed said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4602)|
| 1:16:43| It's really complicated to try to understand and to even explain because it's not about the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4603)|
| 1:16:50| it's 50% of the average income, below 50% of the average income of all seniors in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4610)|
| 1:16:56| instead of just all incomes in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| But it's about $36,000, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| Right now that's about what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4621)|
| 1:17:02| But that can change year to year depending on what people's average incomes, whether they go up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4622)|
| 1:17:08| What she is saying is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| Craig just told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| But the amount is the $36,050.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| I'd just be curious if you took it to $40,000, you know, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| how much would Knox County lose on that from income coming in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| I guess we'll talk about that at the luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4644)|
| 1:17:28| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4650)|
| 1:17:31| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| When's this lunch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4654)|
| 1:17:35| Oh, one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| When is this lunch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| Is it the 27th of September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4658)|
| 1:17:39| 27th is the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| It's 530 in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| Is that the legacy parks office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| UT football game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| I would have checked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| Yes, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| The next item is on page 14, resolution 912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| It's authorizing education incentive payments to county officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| and full-time supervisory level employees of Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| for the attainment or recertification of the designation of certified public administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4685)|
| 1:18:11| I've had an opportunity to look into this, and I have a compromise I want to put forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| but I'd like to get a motion on the floor so we can discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| If you'd come forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| You handed out a list today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| In my conversations with Chris, I had asked him how many employees were under the program right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4707)|
| 1:18:34| who had been working on this certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| The officeholders told me October 31st was the cutoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| So I asked him to give me a list of how many people would be involved that are involved now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| that have been told that if they did this program that there would be some type of incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| So could you tell us what the results of that were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| If you look at the handout that I passed out, there was a total of 18 individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| that get the incentive pay right now, and that cost the fee officers of the county $35,558.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4739)|
| 1:19:09| Of the 18, I think three are elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| So you're really talking about 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| So there would be no more involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| These are the people that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| And the only way they'd be more involved is if they pass the certification this past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4761)|
| 1:19:27| and they're added to the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| But we would not know that until they send it up to payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| But I wouldn't imagine it would be a great deal more, if any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| My second question, Commissioner Smith, I know that you've talked about a task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| and that you've formed a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| Could you update us on where that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| Let me bring it up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| Mr. Chairman, I've got three business cards right here from state people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| three people from Nashville that we have an ongoing investigation going on here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4786)|
| 1:19:52| I was hoping it would be done by now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| You know, we'd had a task force, and my goal was that once the investigation is over with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| then we would convene and sort of see where we go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| And that's still what I want to do is to wait for the investigation to be over with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4801)|
| 1:20:06| and what findings that they have with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| But I'm not going to be supporting this because I think there's ongoing investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4809)|
| 1:20:14| and number one, and then number two, I just don't think it's right for people to get continuing education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| Nobody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| I had a girl in my Sunday school class just tell me yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| she took Friday, Saturday, and half-day Sunday for medical training that she was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| She didn't get anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| Now, her employer pays for her to take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| But nobody that has continuing ed gets paid for doing a continuing ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4830)|
| 1:20:37| I mean, if they want to give it to the employees, and these are friends of mine, just give them a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| You know, just have it in there and not do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| The course itself is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| I don't have a problem with the course whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| But everybody that I talk to and letters that I've seen to the editors in the papers and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| nobody's for us to give continuing education bonuses of any kind to employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4853)|
| 1:21:02| Let me ask one other question, and then I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| The question is, well, let me just go ahead and tell you what I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4866)|
| 1:21:13| These employees who have been going through this, apparently they have been undergoing this training now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4873)|
| 1:21:19| They have been told by doing this that they were going to get something for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| I feel like that the proper thing to do would be to go ahead and give these 15 employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| since they have been working on it, something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| and then close the program until we've had an opportunity to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| With the task force, I know that there is an investigation going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| We're hearing all kinds of rumors about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| But to me, that's a separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| The employees that we have who are doing this stop the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4903)|
| 1:21:47| but these folks that have been working on it with the understanding that they would get something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| let's go ahead and give them something when they complete this course as of October 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| But stop it until we have a chance to really look at it, because I believe that there are some legal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| Mr. Buch has sent us a memo taking a look at where we are with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| and I believe that there are a number of questions that need to be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| So I bring that up as a possible alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4931)|
| 1:22:12| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| Do we have the authority to tell the trustee, the registrar, the deeds, and the county clerk what they can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4934)|
| 1:22:20| and not do with their employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| We do have, as I understand it, under this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| we do have the authority to set the guidelines and the boundaries for it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| Am I right with that, Mr. Jarrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| Yeah, the way the program was set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| it presumed that the elected officials who had employees participating were desirous of having them get the stipend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4953)|
| 1:22:42| Of course, again, the key phrase is once they've completed, not substantially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4962)|
| 1:22:47| but once they've completed the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| That's why, because it is a program administered by the County Technical Advisory Service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4969)|
| 1:22:55| they give you a draft resolution where the county commission sets aside those monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| You know, could conceivably separate elected officials say, I don't care if the money's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4981)|
| 1:23:06| my people aren't going to participate and I'm not going to pay them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| Conceivably, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| But the whole idea is it's supposed to be a voluntary program that's embraced by all the elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4990)|
| 1:23:16| You know, I guess the question I don't understand, because this has been around for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=4996)|
| 1:23:21| is where is that in the budget right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| Well, I know, but we don't do the salary suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5003)|
| 1:23:28| That's my whole point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| I mean, my whole point is that we've gone over this again and again and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| and I really don't want to beat this horse anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| I mean, I think it's come up now four or five times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| It was rejected recently by the Charter Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5021)|
| 1:23:47| that the county commission does not have control over the salaries of the elected fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| That's done by the elected officials in the fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5032)|
| 1:23:56| They set the salaries and it's done through the salary suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| And we don't control the salary suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| And we, as the commissioners, have said we don't want to control the salary suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5042)|
| 1:24:08| We want to give that to the elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| And I'm trying to figure out where, since this is a salary and this is a bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| I'm trying to figure out where this fits in with how things are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5055)|
| 1:24:22| When I had met with Mr. Ballard and Ms. Witt, they said they needed direction from commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5062)|
| 1:24:28| Now, Phil Ballard is different, though, because he has a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| Right, but also Ms. Witt had said the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| So, I mean, she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| You know, if you all want to weigh in, please come down and do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| But that was the discussion I'd had with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| that they needed direction from county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| That was why I brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| Because, I mean, it would still, I mean, we can give them direction, but it would still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| we can tell them what to do, but because this is salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| it seems like it would still fall under the salary suit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| And I know it may seem like I'm a little bit on the other side now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| but I'm sort of defending, you know, your right to do, you know, to reimburse people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5102)|
| 1:25:08| Now, I understand the people that are in the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| and maybe the property assessor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| but the fee offices are different because their salaries come out of the fees before they're submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5115)|
| 1:25:23| through the salary suit before it's submitted to the county for the excess funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5123)|
| 1:25:29| You're exactly right, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| And I think myself and the property assessor, Phil Ballard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| talked to Mr. Hammond and Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| and was just trying to get something going across the board where we did the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5139)|
| 1:25:44| and however you all decide what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| And I'm not sure about the year because I think they've gone back to see when commission actually ratified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5147)|
| 1:25:53| to allow the elected officials to give this education incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| They can't find that anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| I don't know what that is, but I wasn't too concerned because I understand they can't find the charter either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| But that being said, we just want to make sure that we were doing the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5166)|
| 1:26:13| and giving the right amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| And, you know, I have no problem if one elected official doesn't want to give anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| That's their prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| If another elected official has it in their fees and can, then we want to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5181)|
| 1:26:27| and they don't want to do it in the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| But one of the, you know, and I appreciate what you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| but we could have other elected officials that will come down here and they'll say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5194)|
| 1:26:39| we don't want the county commission telling us how we, you know, reimburse this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| And I guess my question is, and the way I understand it, they have the right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5204)|
| 1:26:49| And this is, and I understand why you did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5209)|
| 1:26:53| but under the salary system, I don't see how we have any influence over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| Well, it has to be ratified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5217)|
| 1:26:58| The way that it's written with the state legislature is that it has to be ratified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| And so what they did when this came before the commission before is they said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5223)|
| 1:27:07| they went directly from what was written at the state legislature branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| and they said that you can give up to $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5231)|
| 1:27:15| Now, you know, sometimes you have those fees, sometimes you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| The fee officers, the officers should know what's in the fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| So I don't think, I think that's what Commissioner Hammond was trying to do, is just make it uniform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| Whereas one person's not getting this amount, this person's not getting this amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5248)|
| 1:27:32| and I have no problem with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| and I don't think any of the rest of the elected officials would have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| And I'd like to make one other comment, and this has to do with what Commissioner Smith said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5258)|
| 1:27:44| You know, I think there is a value to our employees taking these courses because they do serve the public better that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5264)|
| 1:27:54| They do serve the taxpayers better that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| And I believe, what is it, $300 to enroll in the course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| And that's probably, you know, money well spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| And I would, you know, I would go ahead and support as many employees getting involved in this as they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5282)|
| 1:28:09| and I think that we should reimburse them for that because that is an out-of-pocket expense that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5289)|
| 1:28:15| And we can talk about, I think that should be a separate issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| than how much they get after they've completed it every year as a bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5299)|
| 1:28:25| And I wonder if we want to separate those questions or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| because I do think that if an employee takes that course, he's better able to serve the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5309)|
| 1:28:36| and $300 is not a lot of money to spend to get better service to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5316)|
| 1:28:43| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| I am anxious to find out what the task force does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5327)|
| 1:28:52| I agree with Dr. Briggs that this is a very valuable program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| and I would like to see as many employees as possible take advantage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| But I also think it's absolutely the right thing to do to offer them an incentive to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5340)|
| 1:29:09| I'm not sure about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| I don't agree with a yearly bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| I don't think that that's the best way to go about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| I like the idea of if somebody takes this course and passes it, and they get a step raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5356)|
| 1:29:23| and that's pretty straightforward and easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| And then, you know, if they keep their continuing education up every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| then they get to stay at that step level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| And then we don't ñ part of my problem with this is that I, and you all, this is no surprise to any of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5375)|
| 1:29:43| I want every county employee treated the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| No matter who they work for or where they work in the county, they should all be treated fairly and equitably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5386)|
| 1:29:52| So that's part of the problem that I have with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| is that some people are doing it and some people aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| But I ñ and I support this, but I don't know if it's going to make things any easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5398)|
| 1:30:04| or if it's just going to make things even more confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| Commissioner Smith said a while ago that he'd rather see them get raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| Sherry, do you all ñ you don't operate under the same step raise system that the other county employees do, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5416)|
| 1:30:27| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| No, and I was kind of surprised at that suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| Commissioner Smith had actually suggested that to me several months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| in that just give them a raise or just add that amount into their salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5437)|
| 1:30:41| And that totally against ñ goes against the whole spirit of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5441)|
| 1:30:47| I mean, it's an incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5447)|
| 1:30:48| If you do what you're supposed to do, if you go back and you get recertified every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5448)|
| 1:30:53| then you get the money, not just for the heck of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| Well, once you put it in there, you can't take it out, what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5461)|
| 1:31:02| As in their salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5464)|
| 1:31:05| And that's what would happen if you did it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| Because I think what Commissioner Burrell is saying is she's just saying that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| we want to be fair to everybody and trying to give them an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| And I do understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| But, you know, most of the elected officials, I mean, we are elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| and the people are putting the faith in us that we know how much to pay these people, what to do, who to send.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5482)|
| 1:31:29| I mean, everybody can't be an administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| I mean, it's just that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| There's lots of worker bees that make some of the other bees look a lot better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| but they're not administrative potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| So it's not that you can't send everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5499)|
| 1:31:43| And just quite frankly, there's a lot of employees in my office that just don't want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| They don't want to take the time to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| Well, based on what we just talked about, as far as once you put it in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| the salary is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| Anywhere, you know, county governments operate differently than a lot of businesses do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5517)|
| 1:32:07| And the way that their salaries are structured and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| But to have a county employee who is rewarded for going the extra step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| to learn a little more, to be able to do his job better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| everybody in the county benefits from that in addition to that employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5538)|
| 1:32:25| So, you know, to me that's the most fair and equitable plan is, okay, you take this course, you finish it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5545)|
| 1:32:32| we pay for your course, and we set a figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| We take $1,500 from the state so we can add up to $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5555)|
| 1:32:40| Only the elected official gets $1,500 from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| The county employees get nothing from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5566)|
| 1:32:47| So we set a figure, and I would agree that it should be the same for every department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5567)|
| 1:32:53| So that's kind of where I stand on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| That's all we were trying to do is just get some direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| I want to build on Commissioner Broyles and then Commissioner Briggs' question about where is the money right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5581)|
| 1:33:10| We're talking salary suit, but since this isn't really salary, this is an incentive payment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5590)|
| 1:33:20| which should be an operating expense, shouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| And if it is an operating expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| then it comes every year in the form of the budget that all these elected officers present to the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5606)|
| 1:33:35| which eventually get rolled into something we see, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| But, anyway, I guess we're going to get the answer, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| Where's the $1,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| As far as the fee officers go, they ask they that language is in their salary suit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5623)|
| 1:33:49| that if the employees pass the course and have their certification, then they get the bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| And it is paid out of payroll as a bonus from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| The CTAS bonus is the pay code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| So it's actually a bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| But it comes from the salary suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| It comes from the salary suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| It is in the salary suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| Okay, so that's for the elected official?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| And their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| Their employees also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5654)|
| 1:34:15| And their employees, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5655)|
| 1:34:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5656)|
| 1:34:17| So there was, you know, some bouncing back and forth of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| Now, having said that, you know, you've commented on, Dr. Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5661)|
| 1:34:28| you've commented on the charter committee didn't want to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5668)|
| 1:34:32| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5672)|
| 1:34:33| I'm through with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| So the money exists somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5674)|
| 1:34:42| Now, I'm going to back up now to really my first comment or my first question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5682)|
| 1:34:47| in that this is something that is embedded in Tennessee code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5687)|
| 1:34:54| The state of Tennessee thinks it advantageous that the elected official attends certain training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5694)|
| 1:35:06| through the University of Tennessee is advantageous for all the counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| in Tennessee to take advantage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5710)|
| 1:35:13| And in order to try to get everyone to attend that, there's dollars attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5713)|
| 1:35:20| The reason I think it occurs then the next year, maybe not to the same extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5720)|
| 1:35:26| or maybe at the same pay level, it doesn't really make any difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| they have to offer courses which contain additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5731)|
| 1:35:37| I cannot speak in financial terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| We'd have to call on Commissioner Shouse to talk about Gatsby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5740)|
| 1:35:44| and what happens year to year to year about changes in the financial code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5744)|
| 1:35:52| Now, that doesn't mean that truck drivers or who was it I said I wanted to work for the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5752)|
| 1:35:59| I'm going to work for Parks and Rec because I can mow a lot of grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5759)|
| 1:36:05| That person doesn't need to attend training on Gatsby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| But the trustee or I've really picked the wrong one, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5768)|
| 1:36:20| There's a need for continuing education and it's an incentive program that the states authorize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5780)|
| 1:36:27| so then that is also then passed down to us at the county level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5787)|
| 1:36:32| And do we want to take advantage of that or not to make an incentive for people to go attend the training in that year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5792)|
| 1:36:39| If they go and they get recertified, well, then they get the thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| or whatever it is we're proposing for the employee level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5802)|
| 1:36:47| I kind of look at it as it's an okay thing at first blush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5807)|
| 1:36:53| Maybe I'll come back and say something different whenever we continue to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5813)|
| 1:36:58| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| Chair, let me ask you a question and I've got a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| I'm looking at this sheet that they gave us here, these people that got the $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5826)|
| 1:37:11| Do you know the second year, what hours involved in the second year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| I know it's just 16 hours that they take for the two-day course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| Do you do any of that at the computer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| At the office, the employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| On the recertification, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| You can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| There's some online classes both ways, before you graduate and after you graduate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| Here's just where I've got heartburn, Sherry, is you take $3,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5852)|
| 1:37:36| an employee gets $3,000 for taking the second year course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| That comes out to $187.50 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| The employee is going to make $187 an hour for taking a 16-hour course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| Then he sits there and takes while he's at his or her desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| While he's on county employee time, he or she is still getting paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| You know, we have fiduciary responsibility over the taxpayer's money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5876)|
| 1:38:00| and to pay the people $187, you know, that's just what I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| And then if we do $1,000, that comes out to $62.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| Like I say, don't have a problem with the course whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5887)|
| 1:38:12| I just have a little bit of heartburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5892)|
| 1:38:13| It comes out to $187 an hour for the second-day course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5893)|
| 1:38:19| You know, I can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5899)|
| 1:38:20| I can't talk about what upsets you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| Well, I mean, sure, it gives them knowledge to work at the counter and the desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| But, you know, it also, to me, it gives them the knowledge that when they're ready for that promotion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5907)|
| 1:38:32| when you're going to promote that individual, it's on their resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| That's when they get the pay raise from it, too, because the people are certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5915)|
| 1:38:42| Law Director, I have a question for maybe Dave Booth or Joe, whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| We talked in the workshop, we asked about the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| You know, some people can take the course, some people can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| Are we opening ourselves up for a lawsuit with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| What did we find out on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| It was my opinion, no, that the way this is drafted, for instance, take the registrar's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5937)|
| 1:39:05| It's totally within her discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| The way the issue comes up more than the elected offices is in the all the other employees who fall under the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5948)|
| 1:39:17| I don't think that, and I believe that the mayor, who's responsible for all employees who are not employees of elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5957)|
| 1:39:26| can make his own determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| I talked with Dean in the mayor's office, and his, the mayor's position is, unless it's changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5968)|
| 1:39:35| and I don't know if he's here, was he didn't believe in county taxpayer money going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5975)|
| 1:39:41| He did believe that paying the $300 tuition would be beneficial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| but he felt like anybody else that wanted to continue education, it should be at their own time and expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5987)|
| 1:39:54| And, of course, it goes in their resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| So, ultimately, that's a long way of saying, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| I don't think there's a problem with worrying about the parks and rec guy who's a mower out there going to class to get a $1,000 raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=5998)|
| 1:40:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6008)|
| 1:40:09| Chair, that's just where I'm at with it, just personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| I just think, just what he said, if you've got, if I'm an employer for you and I want to take the course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6010)|
| 1:40:15| and Austin County pays for the course, that's great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| but you don't need to bonus me $187 an hour for me taking a two-day course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6018)|
| 1:40:24| I just, I cannot in good conscience do that as a commissioner with people's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6024)|
| 1:40:30| I can give you a lot of examples in the private sector, as I'm sure the rest of you could, that it's probably that way, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6030)|
| 1:40:35| I'm thinking about county employees, and I don't know what county employees you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| but the ones that I know, most of them work two jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| So, I don't know what that $62 or $82 does, but I know that these two guys right here behind me work extra jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6041)|
| 1:40:51| Those two guys could teach the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| They know so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| They're good employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6055)|
| 1:40:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| I guess I have to speak looking at the other side of the issue from Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6059)|
| 1:41:05| and I do not view the employee attending the class dividing his annual pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6065)|
| 1:41:13| by the number of hours that he sits in class or she sits in class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6073)|
| 1:41:18| I look at the value that should be returned to the citizens of Knox County on the yearly basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6078)|
| 1:41:28| of whether or not this is a better employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| And everyone will not be attending the classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| The only people attending would be those who the certifying manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6095)|
| 1:41:44| might look at as being a good return on investment for that education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6104)|
| 1:41:52| So, there again, I could still be on the fence, but I'm beginning to think that no, I'm not going to pass on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6112)|
| 1:42:02| I've only passed on the things today that I thought we ought not to have been playing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6122)|
| 1:42:07| This, though, is an issue before us about whether or not we can have a better operation of Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6127)|
| 1:42:17| with the true decision about who needs to attend this training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6137)|
| 1:42:22| Everyone will not attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| There will be ñ and looking at the list here, there are very few people who are certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6144)|
| 1:42:31| And I think it will continue to be that way because the elected official will have to be looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6151)|
| 1:42:37| will the return on this investment of $300 for the course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6157)|
| 1:42:42| or the annual whatever is paid for this recertification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| will it be in the best interest of the citizens of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| And if they make the wrong decision, well, then they're up to suffer the consequence every few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6171)|
| 1:42:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6180)|
| 1:43:01| I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6181)|
| 1:43:02| I think it's a good idea, Sherry, if we can afford the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| And I won't ñ did Chris leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| No, he's ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6187)|
| 1:43:08| I need him to ñ yeah, no, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6188)|
| 1:43:16| I've tried to follow this debate over the last few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| Why are there so many numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| Some are 1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6202)|
| 1:43:23| Some are 3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| Some are 1,638.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| Even a 1,632.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| Are the odd amounts the money that flows in from the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| The 1,638.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6212)|
| 1:43:33| And it's different each year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6213)|
| 1:43:34| The 1,638 like on page two under Julian McCroskey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| Yeah, elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6219)|
| 1:43:40| That's what we had to do to make it whole for the 3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| So that means the state paid the difference of the 1,332 or whatever that comes out to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6224)|
| 1:43:52| And that's what like ñ that's what Ms. Witt got then, the elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| I see one elected official got a different amount, but I won't debate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6235)|
| 1:44:00| But as in numbers, I wonder if it is ñ as it really appears, it's 3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6240)|
| 1:44:06| Is the max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| Is the max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| But the county still has to add Social Security, Medicare, pension max, or is it 3,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6249)|
| 1:44:16| It's probably 3,300 or 3,400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| It's just the three and they take that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| Okay, the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6263)|
| 1:44:24| They don't get three and then plus FICA plus pension max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6264)|
| 1:44:29| It comes out below the line then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6271)|
| 1:44:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6273)|
| 1:44:34| So the bottom line to the county is three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| Yeah, and this report would show you something good as well because as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| some offices will pay a total of 1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6278)|
| 1:44:41| Some will pay 3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6281)|
| 1:44:42| So there's not ñ there's not a ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| And then there's one 650.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6286)|
| 1:44:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6290)|
| 1:44:51| I mean, I just saw it looks like it was inconsistent to me of where it sort of bounced all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6291)|
| 1:44:58| That's irrelevant, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| And that could be something that was paid out of our own code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| That may have been something that was a different type of state pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6304)|
| 1:45:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6309)|
| 1:45:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6310)|
| 1:45:11| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6311)|
| 1:45:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| I don't want to keep beating a dead horse either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| Just one final comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6315)|
| 1:45:16| The question has been asked a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| Where is this money in the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| Where is this money in the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| Each of these fee offices submit that salary suit projecting what they're going to be spending for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6320)|
| 1:45:27| And in that is X amount of dollars set aside for these bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6327)|
| 1:45:33| If they don't use them at the end of the year, what happens to the end of that money at the end of the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| Just like every other department, it goes back into general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| So that's where the money is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| It's in their salary suit that they put up, you know, at the beginning of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6343)|
| 1:45:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| The motion on the floor is to approve up to $1,000 for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6353)|
| 1:46:02| Now, is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| Did you make a suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6363)|
| 1:46:04| Does that include tuition or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| Or is this a bonus after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| I mean, they get their tuition paid, and then if they complete the course it's $1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6368)|
| 1:46:12| and if they maintain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6372)|
| 1:46:13| I don't think this addressed the tuition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| Mike, did you make a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| I had brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6377)|
| 1:46:18| I was going to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6378)|
| 1:46:19| The substitute motion is that we approve up to $1,000 for these employees that have been told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6379)|
| 1:46:27| that if they did this program they would receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| And, again, it's up to $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| It would be up to the office holder to determine how much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| But at that point, we put a hold on the program until we've had a chance to evaluate it through this task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6393)|
| 1:46:39| and committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| That would be my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| I would second that if you want to make that substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| In addition to any money they get from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| I just feel like if they've been told and they've been working on it that we need to follow through with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| But at that point, we just stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| These are the only ones available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| And then we can look at it and really take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6417)|
| 1:47:01| Just to clarify things, this just deals with the 15 people who are in the course now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6421)|
| 1:47:06| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6426)|
| 1:47:07| Is that correct, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| Pardon me, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6430)|
| 1:47:11| The only people in the program are the ones that you've given us here, the 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6436)|
| 1:47:17| So these are the people that you have in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| So that is the substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6442)|
| 1:47:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6443)|
| 1:47:24| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6444)|
| 1:47:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6445)|
| 1:47:26| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6446)|
| 1:47:27| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6447)|
| 1:47:28| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6448)|
| 1:47:29| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| The next item is Resolution 913.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| It's designating and committing and appropriating funds in the amount of $50,000 from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2013| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6454)|
| 1:47:43| for the purpose of reimbursing the Beck Cultural Exchange Center up to $50,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6463)|
| 1:47:48| for the center's operating expenses for fiscal year 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6472)|
| 1:47:53| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6473)|
| 1:47:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6474)|
| 1:47:55| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6475)|
| 1:47:56| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| I guess I will amend this lightly to hopefully alleviate any concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6481)|
| 1:48:10| and any future kind of, you know, opinion that maybe we're doing something that's right in an open checkbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6490)|
| 1:48:18| So I will take out the operating expenses and put in for program funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6498)|
| 1:48:25| And if you want, I can spend a little time going through what type of programs this funding would go to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6505)|
| 1:48:36| I definitely understand the concern about, you know, just saying, well, we'll pay your bills up to $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6516)|
| 1:48:43| That was never the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6523)|
| 1:48:44| So just in my haste to get something on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6524)|
| 1:48:50| I think from our chairman's lunch we did have the opportunity to hear that there are all going to be some funds available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6530)|
| 1:48:59| This isn't a recurring thing, but this is an opportunity, I think, to continue that relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6539)|
| 1:49:09| non-committal relationship with the Beck Cultural Center, which we've made a significant investment in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6549)|
| 1:49:15| And more importantly, it goes to support some really needed programs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6555)|
| 1:49:21| They've partnered with Emory Youth to provide after-school tutoring by retired teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6561)|
| 1:49:32| This is a great program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| And as you know, with Emory Youth, they're really good about coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6574)|
| 1:49:38| and undergirding the program for a while, but then hopefully trying to grow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| So that's a partnership where they're going to, you know, they've been helping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6582)|
| 1:49:46| and then we'll try to get those, you know, that assistance down, and it becomes a stand-alone program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6586)|
| 1:49:53| But that's, you know, with that comes a need for, if you'd go over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6593)|
| 1:49:58| they have a lot of, they probably hadn't gotten a new computer since they were part of the library system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6598)|
| 1:50:04| So that's been about four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| And you can imagine a desktop that's four years old dealing with viruses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6606)|
| 1:50:11| And just that whole process, virus software, Internet connectivity, to deal with something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6611)|
| 1:50:18| things to support that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| One of the other things they're wanting to do is that, again, with the facility and with the abilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6620)|
| 1:50:27| Like I tell folks, you know, Beck is so much more than a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| and if you go by the historic house, you'll see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| They deal a lot with Knox County students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6634)|
| 1:50:39| Those of us that had the opportunity to go to the Nashville Public Library, the main downtown library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| they have a listening room, deals with the desegregation in the Nashville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6644)|
| 1:50:50| They have, you know, films and voices where you can actually go and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| sit at a counter and hear a recreation of what was happening then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6654)|
| 1:50:59| So they wouldn't copy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| But something like that to do, you know, a lot of people are very visual learners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| and they try to meet not only the kids but all of our needs in terms of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6665)|
| 1:51:11| something to be able to tell the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6671)|
| 1:51:16| And, you know, those are two of the three of the big things that they're wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6676)|
| 1:51:22| And the last program that they're wanting to roll out is a program for the arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6682)|
| 1:51:29| You know, that's, you know, when you find a child's passion, you've captured him or her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6689)|
| 1:51:34| and you have their attention, and you can, you know, while they're pursuing that art, that play or whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6694)|
| 1:51:41| you can introduce some things to, you know, stabilize that person, that kid's environment and their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6701)|
| 1:51:47| And a lot of people are in school because of things like the arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6707)|
| 1:51:52| So that's another program that they've started but really just don't have the funding right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6712)|
| 1:52:00| I mean, it's a struggle, as you can imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| I mean, it's a struggle all over, but, you know, particularly for Beck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| with them having their numbers thrown off over the last year or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6726)|
| 1:52:11| So that's what I'm asking, and I won't belabor the point any more than I already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| But I did just want to give you all a feel for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| We're not talking about operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6738)|
| 1:52:21| I definitely understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| So that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| Sam and I had a meeting last week and kind of discussed this because he brought it up in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6746)|
| 1:52:29| and I kind of gave him a nod in the budget meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6749)|
| 1:52:35| And I really want to support, you know, when I think of what Beck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6755)|
| 1:52:40| we've invested millions and hundreds of thousands up to millions of dollars in Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6760)|
| 1:52:45| And, you know, if he was asking us to write a blank check for operating expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| he knows where I stand on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6769)|
| 1:52:53| I'm trying to think of maybe the green macaduce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6773)|
| 1:52:56| Is that what it's called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| You know, I got to visit, during Leadership Knoxville, I got to visit Green Macaduce Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6778)|
| 1:53:02| And Green Macaduce Center is just an amazing retelling of our history and Clinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6782)|
| 1:53:09| And, you know, it's a focal point where kids can go and really embrace something that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6789)|
| 1:53:16| And for Beck to be successful, that's what it's going to have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| It's going to have to have a vision and a mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| And while I want to support programming at Beck, and I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6801)|
| 1:53:27| Chris, how can we set aside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6807)|
| 1:53:33| I mean, Sam, I guess the question is for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6813)|
| 1:53:35| If we set aside, you have to designate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| I mean, this month or next month, we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| He wants our, is that what you call it, designations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6820)|
| 1:53:42| That's the old term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6822)|
| 1:53:43| That will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6825)|
| 1:53:46| He wants to set aside, and so we're not drawing out of the fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| Because I have another one I want to bring up next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| And so if we set aside a designation and work out an MOU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6830)|
| 1:53:54| or work out programming that hopefully six of us and the mayor can agree on, is that something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6834)|
| 1:54:00| Is that what you're looking for, Sam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6840)|
| 1:54:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6841)|
| 1:54:02| I mean, you know, I think that will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| I would like to get this put on with the fact that it would be a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| That wouldn't be for a, you know, general operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| But I would like for that to happen today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6851)|
| 1:54:15| What I would say is if we're going to make this a defined service contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6855)|
| 1:54:20| which is what we would recommend, that it be something that is measurable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6860)|
| 1:54:24| And he's listed a list of programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| So I would list those in the resolution, what programs they're for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6867)|
| 1:54:32| Because what's going to happen is it's going to be reimbursable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6872)|
| 1:54:36| So the Beck Center would do quarterly reports, like the other organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6876)|
| 1:54:41| that's going to have to show measurable outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6881)|
| 1:54:45| And so I would list the programs in the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6885)|
| 1:54:50| because they are going to be reimbursable on a quarterly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6890)|
| 1:54:56| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| We used the term there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| What was it we used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6905)|
| 1:55:06| Designate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6906)|
| 1:55:07| You said that would be an okay term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| It sounds like we need certified public administrator certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6910)|
| 1:55:14| so we'd know what it is we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6914)|
| 1:55:18| I think we heard at lunch that there are a few dollars available in the Knox County budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| And the center missed out on the cutoff of last year's appropriation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6922)|
| 1:55:28| and they're currently working with zero dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| The next terms that I have was brought to us right then, measurable outcomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6932)|
| 1:55:37| and programs like Emerald Youth Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| and other things that maybe Commissioner Andrews brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6940)|
| 1:55:45| I look at this as being $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6945)|
| 1:55:48| That's more than some other people got that if they had met their deadline, Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6948)|
| 1:55:54| if they had met their deadline, it would have been a smaller amount than $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6954)|
| 1:55:59| But as we stand right here right now, this one-time money to do a program I can support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6959)|
| 1:56:10| but then it has to come with a caveat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| Next year, you've got to be in there in the mayor's program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6972)|
| 1:56:18| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6980)|
| 1:56:21| Chris, I'm going to need you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| This is a restoration of funding for BECC, and I guess at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6985)|
| 1:56:32| I'm wanting some recommendation from Mr. Caldwell about another restoration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6992)|
| 1:56:39| I don't mean to break the line of logic here, but MPC, and we've talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=6999)|
| 1:56:46| and I've talked to finance about MPC and restoring their budget, $100,000, which is taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7006)|
| 1:56:53| I'm just asking about method here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| Am I stacking on top of BECC's request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7016)|
| 1:57:00| Should I bring it to you next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7020)|
| 1:57:03| How would be the best way to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| I would say to you or any other commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7027)|
| 1:57:12| if you are wanting to designate surplus funds from FY12 for FY13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7032)|
| 1:57:20| you need to do so in the manner that Commissioner McKenzie did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7040)|
| 1:57:26| You need to add the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| because the resolution that we brought to designate funds got approved because it was on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7048)|
| 1:57:35| So you'll have to bring a separate resolution to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7055)|
| 1:57:42| Be mindful, though, that we don't want to spend everything that we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7062)|
| 1:57:49| But bring it separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7069)|
| 1:57:53| And as I told Commissioner Anders, as long as we have it by the September meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7073)|
| 1:57:59| that's the latest that we would want to do any type of designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7079)|
| 1:58:03| because in September we're trying to close our books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7083)|
| 1:58:07| and we can't do so if there's things still going on in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7087)|
| 1:58:12| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| I want to speak in favor of Commissioner McKenzie's proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7094)|
| 1:58:20| And I know there were other organizations that just missed the cutoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7100)|
| 1:58:25| because we had a limited amount of money for some of the community projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7105)|
| 1:58:30| But I do think that BECC is different, and BECC is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7110)|
| 1:58:36| And it's not like some of the things that we may have approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| for some of the cultural events here that are important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| for some of the other organizations that ask those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| But it's a part of our local history, of the Knox County history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7125)|
| 1:58:52| that many of these other organizations don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7132)|
| 1:58:57| I know when we voted on this, maybe even for the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7137)|
| 1:59:01| I didn't support it because I felt at that time we really needed to be conservative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7141)|
| 1:59:08| in what we did with our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7148)|
| 1:59:11| And, quite frankly, the money just wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| Fortunately, we're seeing the funds that are coming in are in excess of what were projected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7154)|
| 1:59:23| And really it's for this reason, because of the uniqueness of the BECC Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7163)|
| 1:59:29| it does represent a significant minority of our population that has a unique history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7169)|
| 1:59:36| that's worth preserving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| Some of the programs that we're talking about, I think, are worth doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7177)|
| 1:59:41| And for that reason, I think that we should support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7181)|
| 1:59:45| and I would encourage all members of the commission to look at it in that light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7185)|
| 1:59:49| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| Christopher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7192)|
| 2:00:03| There's been some good points that have been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7203)|
| 2:00:06| but I just need to feel a little bit more comfortable about doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7206)|
| 2:00:10| Sam, I agree with what you're wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7210)|
| 2:00:13| And I like what Commissioner Briggs just said, and he's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7213)|
| 2:00:16| We've got a little extra money right now, and that makes me feel better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7216)|
| 2:00:20| But my question, though, Chris, is what are other nonprofits that we're giving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7220)|
| 2:00:25| I mean, because what I'm hearing is we're giving this nonprofit $15,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7225)|
| 2:00:30| and everybody else is going to start crying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7230)|
| 2:00:32| And then what I just heard, maybe from Commissioner Anderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7232)|
| 2:00:35| do we all come in here next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| You know, I can give you a detailed thing with the Boys and Girls Club need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7237)|
| 2:00:40| a detailed thing for what the American Cancer Society needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| detailed for the Boy Scouts of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| I can come up with $50,000 for a bunch of nonprofits, and we all can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7245)|
| 2:00:50| And I've got a bunch in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| But I was told things are tight, hold on, and let's not do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7252)|
| 2:00:57| Now, all of a sudden, we've got money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7257)|
| 2:00:58| I mean, where do we stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| I mean, what are we giving other nonprofits of this same, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7260)|
| 2:01:06| and I don't know if this is a fair comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7266)|
| 2:01:08| the Mabry-Hazen House or Blunt Mansion and things like that, but where else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7268)|
| 2:01:12| I mean, I love history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7272)|
| 2:01:13| I love preserving history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| But I want to be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7275)|
| 2:01:19| Thinking back to the budget debate, I think you mentioned Mabry-Hazen House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7279)|
| 2:01:25| Mabry-Hazen House, I think we gave each of those foundations of that, you know, like $1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7285)|
| 2:01:33| I think it was $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| This is what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| As we went through the process, we had a grading system of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7298)|
| 2:01:44| based on the programs that were submitted by the not-for-profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7304)|
| 2:01:49| So they submitted a program, and then they got a grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| And then at the end of the grade, there was a certain allotment of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7312)|
| 2:01:56| And based on the grade, that's what everybody got as far as a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7316)|
| 2:02:01| As an example, Salvation Army had the Joey T. Baker Center, and they got $9,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7321)|
| 2:02:07| Just picked it out, no particular reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7327)|
| 2:02:10| So it's things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7330)|
| 2:02:13| And so what Beck did is Beck missed the cutoff date, I do believe is what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7333)|
| 2:02:22| And so Commissioner McKenzie is trying to restore some of their funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| And what were they after at that time when they missed the cutoff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| I don't know, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7349)|
| 2:02:31| Since they missed the cutoff, we didn't evaluate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| Some of the programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| I spent time telling you what the programs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7354)|
| 2:02:38| So I have it written down here if you want me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7358)|
| 2:02:41| I mean, I heard what you said about what the programs are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| but what did they were going to put in for their early budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7363)|
| 2:02:46| The county never got the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7368)|
| 2:02:49| Do you know what they were going to ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7369)|
| 2:02:50| We just went through a lot of the programs that they were asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| I heard the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7373)|
| 2:02:54| Do you have a dollar amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7374)|
| 2:02:56| I'm not on Beck's board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7376)|
| 2:02:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7377)|
| 2:02:58| I'm just asking if you have a dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7378)|
| 2:03:02| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7382)|
| 2:03:07| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7387)|
| 2:03:08| I mean, I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7388)|
| 2:03:09| It's a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| I won't say that it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| But it's your all's prerogative to bring forth what you want to next month as far as designations go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7394)|
| 2:03:22| As the finance director, I would just caution you that we need not spend everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7402)|
| 2:03:28| We do need to increase our fund balance amount and pay down debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7408)|
| 2:03:33| I mean, that's things that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7413)|
| 2:03:36| Just because there is a surplus at the end of the year doesn't mean we need to designate every bit of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7416)|
| 2:03:45| and spend every bit of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| So you're saying, as commissioners, we can come in with a request for September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7428)|
| 2:03:51| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7431)|
| 2:03:52| I mean, that's your all's prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7432)|
| 2:03:57| And then you can ask my opinion, and I'll tell you what I think, and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7437)|
| 2:04:03| But be cautious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7443)|
| 2:04:04| Our goal is not to spend everything that's left over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7444)|
| 2:04:11| We want to add a fund balance, and there's no reason not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7451)|
| 2:04:17| I myself will probably bring more designations next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7457)|
| 2:04:22| but it's going to be for things that are like paying on or defined service programs, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7462)|
| 2:04:32| defined service benefits, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7472)|
| 2:04:35| Just to want to give out money, I would just caution you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7475)|
| 2:04:44| It's touchy, and I don't want to go down that road, but it's, you know, do what you feel is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7484)|
| 2:04:51| They did not get it in on time, and did you just not look at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7491)|
| 2:04:55| Do you know what they would have asked for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7495)|
| 2:04:57| Do you have that amount, what they were asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7497)|
| 2:05:03| And the reason I'm asking for it, well, I'd like to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7503)|
| 2:05:07| Hugh Holt, purchasing director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| We don't open late bids, and so I wouldn't know what they were asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7509)|
| 2:05:15| We just clock the outside of the envelope and stamp it late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7515)|
| 2:05:19| I don't want to approve $50,000 if they were only asking for $12,500, you know, like others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7519)|
| 2:05:24| That was Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7524)|
| 2:05:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| I can comfortably say that that bid process had more than $50,000 worth of ask in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7530)|
| 2:05:40| just like I'm sure the Joy Music School probably had more than $9,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7540)|
| 2:05:44| So if that's your concern, we're not going to overpay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7544)|
| 2:05:47| give them more than what they were asking if that's your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7547)|
| 2:05:50| What I'd like to do is, hopefully I've addressed some of the pressing issues I heard from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7550)|
| 2:05:58| Commissioners Anders, Wright, and I don't know if it came from Commissioner Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7558)|
| 2:06:03| but I think a simple change here in this resolution would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7563)|
| 2:06:07| That last sentence in the narrative says $50,000 for the center's program expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7567)|
| 2:06:13| through the defined services process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| That gets the rebate process, and it says this isn't going for operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7576)|
| 2:06:21| this is going for the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| And within that defined services process, they have to describe what the program is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7583)|
| 2:06:28| So I do think it addresses those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| So if my second would agree, I would like to make those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7590)|
| 2:06:35| Does the second agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| Before we vote, I would just like to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| I'm going to be voting in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7600)|
| 2:06:42| And the reason I'm voting in favor of it is not because I want to just hand out money to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7602)|
| 2:06:47| I see BEC as an economic weapon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| I believe it is a tourism weapon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| I believe that by investing in this facility that we can get dollars back through tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7612)|
| 2:06:58| I truly believe that because having lived in Birmingham| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7618)|
| 2:07:01| and see when they brought in the Civil Rights Museum and all of the different types of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7621)|
| 2:07:06| I just think that from a historical standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| that this is an opportunity for us to have something to market for other people to come in and visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7628)|
| 2:07:13| The other reason I'm in favor of it is I have met with the BEC board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7633)|
| 2:07:16| Commissioner McKenzie and I met with them a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| I'm convinced that they have tightened their belts, that they have reduced their hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7639)|
| 2:07:23| They have looked at the salary expenses of their people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7643)|
| 2:07:26| They have made adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7646)|
| 2:07:27| They've made cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7647)|
| 2:07:28| But now they're wanting to do programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| And these programs are for young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| And one of the programs I was particularly interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| and impressed with, frankly, was the fact that when you have students after school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7655)|
| 2:07:40| who have a place to come by, work on computers, they have after school programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7660)|
| 2:07:44| They also have programs for students that might be suspended for whatever reason instead of being on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7664)|
| 2:07:49| They're coming into BEC, and they have tutors there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7669)|
| 2:07:52| I see that as very beneficial, and I see that as saving us money in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7672)|
| 2:07:56| So I'm looking at this as an investment, and I'll be voting in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7676)|
| 2:08:00| Let's do a roll call vote, clerk, and we'll start in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7680)|
| 2:08:03| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| With those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7686)|
| 2:08:08| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7688)|

| 2:08:17| Commissioner Norman votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7697)|

| 2:08:20| Commissioner Owenby votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7700)|
| 2:08:21| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7701)|

| 2:08:26| Commissioner Anders votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7706)|
| 2:08:27| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| I vote aye if Sam takes me to Chandler's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| Commissioner Smith votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7710)|
| 2:08:31| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7711)|
| 2:08:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7712)|
| 2:08:33| Commissioner Wright votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7713)|
| 2:08:34| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7714)|

| 2:08:46| We'll take a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7726)|
| 2:08:47| I just got a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7727)|
| 2:08:48| You got a big one coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7728)|
| 2:08:49| We've got discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7729)|
| 2:08:50| I'm with you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7730)|
| 2:08:51| Do you want to take a quick break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7731)|
| 2:08:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7732)|
| 2:08:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7733)|
| 2:08:54| Let's take a quick break here, and we'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7734)|
| 2:08:56| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7736)|
| 2:08:58| I'm with you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7738)|
| 2:09:17| Clerk, if you'd read the next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7757)|
| 2:09:20| We're on page 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7760)|
| 2:09:21| It's the ordinance from first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7761)|
| 2:09:24| It is amending Article Two, Section 2.03 of the Knotts County Charter, entitled Membership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7764)|
| 2:09:30| and Election, District Seats Reapportionment and Redistricting, to provide for a 15-member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7770)|
| 2:09:36| commission elected from 15 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7776)|
| 2:09:38| This amends Knotts County Charter as adopted November 8th, 1988, as amended through referendum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7778)|
| 2:09:44| of August 2nd, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7784)|
| 2:09:48| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7788)|
| 2:09:49| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7789)|
| 2:09:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7790)|
| 2:09:51| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7791)|
| 2:09:56| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7796)|
| 2:10:01| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7801)|
| 2:10:02| Well, I'd ask the law department if they would, and I'll kind of go over the, what this would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7802)|
| 2:10:10| do potentially for the Voting Act and our compliance with that if we went from a straight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7810)|
| 2:10:21| 9 districts to 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7821)|
| 2:10:30| Just looking at the numbers, I know Commissioner Briggs discussed, you know, you could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7830)|
| 2:10:35| two, but I just don't know, you know, without gerrymandering, if it would be, again, at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7835)|
| 2:10:43| this point, it may be possible, but I just kind of wanted to get your opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7843)|
| 2:10:52| I'm sorry, you want my opinion relative to what the implications would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7852)|
| 2:10:57| Whether this would keep, whether this would violate the Voting Rights Act in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7857)|
| 2:11:03| representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7863)|
| 2:11:04| I know the last time, things got close from what I hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7864)|
| 2:11:11| So what would this do going from 9 districts to 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7871)|
| 2:11:16| Potentially you could have one minority candidate or a commissioner for 11 as opposed to one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7876)|
| 2:11:21| for 9 as we have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7881)|
| 2:11:23| So I just wanted your opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| Yes, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7885)|
| 2:11:26| I mean, the biggest concern is, or the manner in which to avoid violating any kind of civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7886)|
| 2:11:34| rights or the Voting Rights Act is the manner in which the district lines are drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7894)|
| 2:11:39| And I really couldn't speculate, depending upon how you actually crafted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7899)|
| 2:11:46| Just the mere number itself is not an implication, but it's a manner in which you draw the lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7906)|
| 2:11:51| If either obviously or just by operation, it turns out to dilute minority voting, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7911)|
| 2:11:59| going to have problems because you don't even have to worry about intent in these type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7919)|
| 2:12:02| cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7922)|
| 2:12:03| The federal government will come down, the Justice Department will say, well, you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7923)|
| 2:12:06| a good intentions, but nevertheless, you've essentially done a diminution or dilution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7926)|
| 2:12:14| of minority voting by operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7934)|
| 2:12:17| So it'd be the devil would be in the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| And remember, prior to our redistricting process with the school board, you gave a really nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7941)|
| 2:12:26| kind of session on that, so I kept a lot of those things in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7946)|
| 2:12:30| Again, you know, I am 100% in favor of what Commissioner Wright's, where his heart is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7950)|
| 2:12:38| His heart and my heart is in the same area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7958)|
| 2:12:42| We have a bunch of people that we're representing and, you know, there's only so many hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7962)|
| 2:12:48| in a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7968)|
| 2:12:49| I tell folks I actually like the 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7969)|
| 2:12:52| I mean, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7972)|
| 2:12:53| It was really nice for, you know, when Tank was working in the city county building, he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7973)|
| 2:13:02| handled all the day-to-day stuff and, you know, I dealt with, you know, the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7982)|
| 2:13:06| I was the guy out there in the community meetings and ripping and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7986)|
| 2:13:09| And I'm sure a lot of us had those type relationships, whether it was Tarns and Powell or Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7989)|
| 2:13:16| or Gibbs, you know, those were really powerful bonds that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=7996)|
| 2:13:25| So I guess I do agree with that, but I like to get an understanding on some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8005)|
| 2:13:30| that Mr. Jarrett pointed out, and that's just, so I just don't know if this is mature enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8010)|
| 2:13:38| to actually have an ordinance on getting ourselves into trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8018)|
| 2:13:43| And like I said, we can unknowingly get ourselves into trouble and say I'm sorry, but it's kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8023)|
| 2:13:48| of too late at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8028)|
| 2:13:49| So I'm really apprehensive about going forward with an ordinance without fully knowing what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8029)|
| 2:13:56| all the, what a lot of the implications are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8036)|
| 2:14:02| Mr. Schaafs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8042)|
| 2:14:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8044)|
| 2:14:05| I think it's a very well-intentioned proposal, and I agree with most of what's been said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8045)|
| 2:14:14| about the 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8054)|
| 2:14:15| I thought 19 was not necessarily too many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8055)|
| 2:14:19| I guess I'm repeating myself from a week ago and five or six weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8059)|
| 2:14:24| That issue got caught up in the Black Wednesday and the nepotism and all that, and a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8064)|
| 2:14:30| money was spent, raised and spent to put a campaign together and get this thing on the ballot by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8070)|
| 2:14:35| professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8075)|
| 2:14:36| I mean, it wasn't raised by professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8076)|
| 2:14:38| I think it was professional signature obtainers that set up at the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8078)|
| 2:14:42| I remember they were down here at Boomsday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8082)|
| 2:14:44| They were at the Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8084)|
| 2:14:45| They were at the Bioware and everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8085)|
| 2:14:49| I thought the 19 was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| If you look at the amount of money saved, 19 to 11, and divide it by 420,000 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8091)|
| 2:14:57| I believe it's about 50 cents apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8097)|
| 2:15:00| It's a very minimal amount of money saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| And I keep remembering all these things that we went through, and I commend Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8103)|
| 2:15:08| He said last, I guess it was last week, that he rephrased how it was presented on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8108)|
| 2:15:15| It was, actually, if you're in favor of continuing nepotism, you'll, or doing away with nepotism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8115)|
| 2:15:26| you'll support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8126)|
| 2:15:28| And the fine print, the print was the same size, but down at the bottom is where it reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8128)|
| 2:15:33| I think it had been clearly stated on the ballot, you want to reduce commission from 19 to 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8133)|
| 2:15:39| it would have failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8139)|
| 2:15:41| And it did fail, I believe, on Election Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8141)|
| 2:15:44| Having said that, I think two years in the political process is sort of a small amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8144)|
| 2:15:52| I'm in favor of giving, let this run its course a little bit more, another two or four or six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8152)|
| 2:15:59| I think it would be very tough, timeline-wise, to vote this through, have a public hearing or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8159)|
| 2:16:08| whenever is required, election commission, and get it on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8168)|
| 2:16:12| I think that would be next to impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8172)|
| 2:16:15| And the big thing, again, I think two years is, I don't think it's run its course long enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8175)|
| 2:16:22| So I just, I cannot support this at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8182)|
| 2:16:25| It's very well-intentioned, and I think the people of Knox County would be very well-served by some additional commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8185)|
| 2:16:32| But, I mean, I hope we're doing our duty as one of 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8192)|
| 2:16:35| I hope each of us, and I think we try to do our duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8195)|
| 2:16:38| But I think we need to let this thing play itself out a few more years, be that two, four, six, or whatever size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8198)|
| 2:16:44| I'm a no vote right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8204)|
| 2:16:47| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8207)|
| 2:16:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8208)|
| 2:16:50| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8210)|
| 2:16:53| I think based on our discussion the other day, we'd already decided that it was too late to try to get it on this November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8213)|
| 2:17:00| We're looking at something down the road which we've got time to work on anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8220)|
| 2:17:04| And I'd like to speak to Mr. McKenzie's query a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8224)|
| 2:17:10| Two or three people have mentioned 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| This says for 15 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8232)|
| 2:17:14| And if you had 15 districts, 99 chances out of 100, Sam, you're going to have two minority districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8234)|
| 2:17:22| So two out of 15 is better than one out of nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8242)|
| 2:17:26| So I don't think that that should be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8246)|
| 2:17:30| And that wouldn't be anything that would keep us from moving forward on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8250)|
| 2:17:34| So I totally would support the 15 for various reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8254)|
| 2:17:40| We've all talked about it many times before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8260)|
| 2:17:44| We realize that, you know, most of us are sitting here for at least another four years anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| So if we're looking at getting this on, it's going to be two years before it can be on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8268)|
| 2:17:54| But that gives us time to work out a plausible plan to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8274)|
| 2:18:00| Yes, Commissioner McKenzie, and then I'd like to address the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8280)|
| 2:18:04| Just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8284)|
| 2:18:05| And this, again, this came through the process that I guess Lynn Fugate and Larry chaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8285)|
| 2:18:14| My district, in terms of percentages, this last redistricting is the first time, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8294)|
| 2:18:22| in the history of the first district that it went above 50 percent African American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8302)|
| 2:18:26| So prior to that, it was like 47, 48 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8306)|
| 2:18:29| So, I mean, it would be great if we could work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8309)|
| 2:18:34| If the numbers will work themselves out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8314)|
| 2:18:36| Again, I don't want to get in gerrymandering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8316)|
| 2:18:38| They can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8318)|
| 2:18:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8319)|
| 2:18:40| So, you know, if it's a concentrated thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8320)|
| 2:18:42| So that's, I just wanted to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8322)|
| 2:18:44| But I, you know, I don't disagree with anything you said, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8324)|
| 2:18:49| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8329)|
| 2:18:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| I wanted to allow the opportunity for anyone that wanted to make comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8333)|
| 2:18:58| and you'll make comment in just a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8338)|
| 2:19:01| to see what might be the sentiment of Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8341)|
| 2:19:07| because we've had this before us for six months or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8347)|
| 2:19:11| and we've not taken time to wrestle with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8351)|
| 2:19:16| I believe that we've gone all over the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8356)|
| 2:19:20| and I do not have notes in front of me to say what we've done about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8360)|
| 2:19:23| but, you know, from having large land mass to represent to dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8363)|
| 2:19:33| to campaign for some of these Commission seats to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8373)|
| 2:19:41| I'm going to go to the fourth one next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| It's the specific language in the Tennessee Code that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8383)|
| 2:19:52| districts will not overlap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8392)|
| 2:19:54| and I'll have to have someone show me how the two at-large districts do not overlap my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8394)|
| 2:20:02| In fact, on the Charter Review Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8402)|
| 2:20:08| former Commissioner Smith offered that the eighth district has the one vote, me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8408)|
| 2:20:15| and then they also have the two votes of the at-large commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8415)|
| 2:20:20| and I asked it two weeks later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8420)|
| 2:20:22| I said, remember that now and think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8422)|
| 2:20:24| and two weeks later I ask now if Commissioner McKenzie and I are on different sides of the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8424)|
| 2:20:31| and I have all three of those votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| how many votes does Commissioner McKenzie have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| and that would be just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8436)|
| 2:20:39| So I think that's where we have gone from a plan that was 19 commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8439)|
| 2:20:47| with a certain way of determining the minority or standing of that particular district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8447)|
| 2:20:55| into a new plan in which I view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8455)|
| 2:21:01| and I think I've got almost former law director, Mr. Joe Jarrett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8461)|
| 2:21:10| back pondering what I say as we speak or as I speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8470)|
| 2:21:16| What is the difference between the plan that we had and the plan that we're under right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8476)|
| 2:21:25| And I have offered to Mr. Jarrett that I think that there's a considerable way of looking at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8485)|
| 2:21:38| that representation in Knox County has changed for minority districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8498)|
| 2:21:43| going from two commissioners on 19 to one commissioner on nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8503)|
| 2:21:50| with two at-large and overlapping districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8510)|
| 2:21:53| and they can't really, the two at-large I don't think can really look to being a split vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8513)|
| 2:22:03| They only have one vote, and they go for what's best of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8523)|
| 2:22:08| and in my consideration that maybe they'd be then prized away from representing a minority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8528)|
| 2:22:19| Anyway, that's just my opinion, and I'm sure the law director has an opinion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8539)|
| 2:22:28| I believe that some have spoke to the fact that we've run out of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8548)|
| 2:22:33| and I agree we've run out of time, so I move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8553)|
| 2:22:37| I change my motion from considering today to this ordinance be deferred to the November meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8557)|
| 2:22:47| if the second will agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8567)|
| 2:22:50| Yes, that was me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8570)|
| 2:22:56| I'll agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8576)|
| 2:22:59| So the maker of the motion and the second has agreed to postpone or defer until the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8579)|
| 2:23:09| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8589)|
| 2:23:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8591)|
| 2:23:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8592)|
| 2:23:13| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8593)|
| 2:23:15| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8595)|
| 2:23:18| The next item is on page 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| under other business discussion regarding the salary survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8601)|
| 2:23:26| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8606)|
| 2:23:27| Yes, I don't think Mark Jones is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8607)|
| 2:23:33| but I was curious about we had approved that and appropriated the money in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8613)|
| 2:23:40| and so I was wondering how that was going, if it was underway, if we had, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8620)|
| 2:23:47| What was going on with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8627)|
| 2:23:49| I don't have an update, but since Mark's not here, or Chris, do you know anything about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8629)|
| 2:23:54| Sort of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8634)|
| 2:23:55| You can maybe give us sort of an update, and then, you know, we can talk more about it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8635)|
| 2:24:01| We have not done anything yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8641)|
| 2:24:04| The lady who is in charge of our salaries and the survey, she was in an automobile accident in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8644)|
| 2:24:15| so we've been putting some things on hold, and she's in rehab, so it could be a little while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8655)|
| 2:24:20| but we have discussed it, but we're kind of holding off right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8660)|
| 2:24:29| Anything else on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| Okay, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8671)|
| 2:24:33| The next item is a discussion regarding the expiration, September 30, 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8673)|
| 2:24:38| of the terms of the following members of the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8678)|
| 2:24:42| Cynthia Stansel, District 1, Frank Remshaw, District 3, John Schoonmaker, District 5, Bill Sewell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8682)|
| 2:24:49| District 7, and Carson Daly, District 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8689)|
| 2:24:53| Is this from the Law Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8693)|
| 2:24:58| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8698)|
| 2:24:59| We, you know, one of our duties and responsibilities is to keep you apprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8699)|
| 2:25:03| All of these members, from my observation and the attorney to whom I have assigned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8703)|
| 2:25:08| they've all performed well, and I believe they all would like to continue to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8708)|
| 2:25:12| and I think they're all eligible to continue to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| But nevertheless, you can certainly take additional applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8715)|
| 2:25:23| Are each of these individuals eligible to serve another term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8723)|
| 2:25:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8726)|
| 2:25:27| Yes, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8727)|
| 2:25:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8730)|
| 2:25:31| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8731)|
| 2:25:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8732)|
| 2:25:33| I did speak with Carson Daly and see him quite frequently, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8733)|
| 2:25:38| But anyway, he tells me that they have three or four things ongoing that they would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8738)|
| 2:25:46| that's going to kind of revamp the way they do business to do it better that they're working on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8746)|
| 2:25:54| So I'm assuming, since he wants to stay, that the rest of them will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8754)|
| 2:25:57| I can't speak for the other districts, but I know that they have some things going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8757)|
| 2:26:02| they'd like to finish up before they're off the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8762)|
| 2:26:06| So I know the ninth, he would like to stay on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8766)|
| 2:26:10| So I guess we won't take nominations until next month since they don't expire until the end of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8770)|
| 2:26:19| Is that right, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8779)|
| 2:26:23| Yes, but, I mean, you can certainly handle it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8783)|
| 2:26:30| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8790)|
| 2:26:31| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8791)|
| 2:26:32| I'd put up Carson Daly for a ninth then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8792)|
| 2:26:35| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8795)|
| 2:26:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8796)|
| 2:26:37| It's sort of a changing subject there, but I would feel that we can handle it today rather than waiting until the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8797)|
| 2:26:46| But what I've wanted to discuss is not about the names or it's the term limits and years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8806)|
| 2:26:59| Somehow this got messed up, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8819)|
| 2:27:03| We were looking at terms of four years, two terms, term limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8823)|
| 2:27:09| That's a total of eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| As I remember this being discussed and then voted out, we were making a Board of Zoning Appeals people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8831)|
| 2:27:23| two-year terms and two terms would be four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8843)|
| 2:27:27| And I see that we've somehow not got there because some are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8847)|
| 2:27:35| one of the printed things I've seen is saying that these people are not term limited because they've not served eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8855)|
| 2:27:43| The term on the Board of Zoning Appeals is two years and term limits is two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8863)|
| 2:27:49| So that would be four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8869)|
| 2:27:51| No one's crossing that threshold in this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8871)|
| 2:27:54| I'm just saying that's something we need to discuss, not tonight or not today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8874)|
| 2:27:59| unless we want to take the time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8879)|
| 2:28:01| But do you understand what I'm trying to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8881)|
| 2:28:05| Yeah, they got a partial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8885)|
| 2:28:06| I think all of them have a partial term in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| Either they're new or have a partial term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8888)|
| 2:28:11| But I'm not looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8891)|
| 2:28:13| I'm looking at the verbiage that says the term is two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8893)|
| 2:28:18| The term limits is two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8898)|
| 2:28:21| That's a total of four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8901)|
