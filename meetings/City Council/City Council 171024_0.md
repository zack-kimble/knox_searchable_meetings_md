| 0:00:30| Good evening. This is Knoxville City Council on Tuesday, October 24th, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=30)|
| 0:00:38| We appreciate everyone who's here tonight. We have a full house, just about, and anyone who might be watching from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=38)|
| 0:00:44| We'll start with an invocation, which will be given by Councilman Wallace, and the pledge will be led by Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=44)|
| 0:00:56| God, teach us to appreciate the natural beauty around us, reawaken our gratitude and our responsibility to assist others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=56)|
| 0:01:04| restore civility throughout our country, and bring peace into our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=64)|
| 0:01:10| We ask for your protection for those that serve us, that run towards danger to protect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=70)|
| 0:01:16| We pray for discernment for the issues before us tonight, that we would act justly and show mercy. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=76)|
| 0:01:26| Please face the flag. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=86)|
| 0:01:32| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=92)|
| 0:01:44| Please call the roll, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=109)|
| 0:01:50| Councilman De La Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=117)|

| 0:01:59| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| Okay, is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| A motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| Any opposed? The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=130)|
| 0:02:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| We're going to withdraw 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| 12B is the Midway Road project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| Okay, any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| Councilman De La Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| Yes, I understand that the applicant wanted to withdraw, and that's certainly, I guess, their right to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=149)|
| 0:02:36| We have received e-mails, and I know I have, and I'm assuming others have, that said they hope this council will do something in the future with regard to the rezoning of that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=156)|
| 0:02:48| I'm sorry, the rezoning of that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| And I have asked legal counsel if they would prepare a resolution for a later meeting where we ask MPC to study that because MPC's advice to us has been to sort of change the zoning so it's one of the planned commercial zones that would allow them to put protective covenants or requirements on future development there to protect the environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=171)|
| 0:03:20| to protect the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| And that sounds like a healthy thing to do, but we probably won't be around, some of us, on this council, but if we ask MPC to look at it, they can advise the next council as reconstituted what's a good thing to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=202)|
| 0:03:35| So, anyway, I just want to call that to folks' attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| Okay, thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| So we have a motion and a second to withdraw 12B, which is a rezoning at Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| That is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| Any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| Items to be added by motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| The consent items are 12C through F, 202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| The consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| For the mayor's report, first I want to welcome the youth leadership group from Leadership Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| Would you all please stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| That's everybody in the building, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Yeah, that's a good group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| This is the high school juniors who are given the opportunity to enhance their knowledge of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| and develop leadership skills through this nine-month program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| and the hope is that it will encourage and inspire them to become involved and committed to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=267)|
| 0:04:33| They have, throughout this program, they meet with business and government leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| and, in fact, this afternoon I had a little while earlier today had an opportunity to meet with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=278)|
| 0:04:46| answer questions, talk about the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| So thank you all for participating in this program and for being here tonight at our council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=288)|
| 0:05:00| And thanks to Leadership Knoxville for sponsoring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| So council, we've been talking all year about the city council elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| and we are down to the last two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| You all know the drill at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| There are five city council seats open this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| and all registered city of Knoxville voters can vote in all five of those races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| So remember that, voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| You can vote for every single district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| It doesn't matter what district you live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| In the general election, everybody gets to vote for all of the district seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| So early voting is going on right now through next Thursday, November 2nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| and you can find information on early voting hours and the locations at knoxcounty.org slash election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=336)|
| 0:05:43| And we encourage everyone to vote early, but if you don't get a chance to, election day is on Tuesday, November 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=343)|
| 0:05:51| which is our next council meeting night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| So you can find more information about the election and the candidates on our website at govotenoxville.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=355)|
| 0:06:02| Again, that's govotenoxville.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| And as you all know, these elections are very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| Five of our nine council members are cycling off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| They are term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| So the majority of council will be new come the end of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| So we encourage everyone to talk to your friends, your co-workers, your family, and encourage them to go out and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=375)|
| 0:06:22| So meanwhile, there are two big back-to-back community events that are coming up, both of which the city is supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| This Sunday, October 29th, from 2 to 6 p.m., Bike Walk Knoxville will hold its fifth Open Streets Knoxville event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=389)|
| 0:06:38| but the first one that's held in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| Open Streets has moved around to different urban corridors, and this Sunday, it's South Knoxville's turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| Previously, the Open Street events were on Central Street in North Knoxville, in Bearden, and along Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=407)|
| 0:06:56| The Gay Street Bridge, Council Place, and Sevier Avenue will be closed to motorized vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| Open Streets participants will stroll, bike, even dance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| We've seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| They're way along the route, while interacting with their neighbors and business owners, playing games,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| and seeing South Knoxville in a fresh, new way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| For the lineup of performers, food trucks, and activities, plus where to park and how to take the CAT bus to the event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=435)|
| 0:07:22| which we highly recommend, don't we, CAT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| We'll hear from y'all in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| You can go to www.openstreetsknoxville.com, openstreetsknoxville.com, to get all that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=447)|
| 0:07:36| You can also check out the city blog on the city's website at knoxvilletn.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| Our communications department has been publishing items and will be publishing more all week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| talking with South Knoxville business owners and residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| and just trying to give you a little taste of what you can expect when you go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| Again, that's this Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| Then, next Friday afternoon, November 3rd, head on over to Cumberland Avenue Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=477)|
| 0:08:03| For the first time in 30 years, the University of Tennessee's Homecoming Parade will roll along Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=483)|
| 0:08:10| and the merchants are eager to welcome the UT alumni and the parade watchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| Cumberland will be closed to vehicles from the east end of Volunteer to 21st Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| beginning at 3.30 p.m. on that Friday, November 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| The parade starts at 4, and there's a 5 to 6 p.m. post-parade celebration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| when the street will remain closed to vehicles and the floats will be parked on display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| You can vote for your favorite float and enjoy the atmosphere on the new Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| and the street will reopen to cars about 6.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| So this is UT's 101st Homecoming Parade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| and we're really excited that they have chosen to celebrate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| by showcasing our $25 million reconstruction of that whole corridor between 17th and 22nd Streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=529)|
| 0:08:57| So again, the parade will begin 4 p.m. on Friday, November 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| Finally, I want to ask our Transit Director, Dawn Disler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| and some of her team members from CAT to come down to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| A few months ago, we announced the exciting news that CAT was chosen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| as the outstanding public transportation system in North America for a transit system our size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| by the American Public Transportation Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| That's a really big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| Two weeks ago, Dawn and I and several of the CAT staff went to the APTA conference in Atlanta| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| to receive the award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| And let me tell you, they make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| It's almost like you're at the Oscars or something, the way they build up and they present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| It's very dramatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| It's very impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| So, Dawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| We were very humbled and honored two weeks ago to go to Atlanta| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| and pick up an award for being North America's most outstanding transit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=590)|
| 0:09:56| And that is for small operators, operators of our size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| When I came here three years ago, a little over three years now, it's hard to believe it's been three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| but we started a culture for CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| And what we said was that if you work hard and you understand how much a part of this community you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=611)|
| 0:10:19| you will understand that you're the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| And if you work and show you're the best, you will be given awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| I mean, people will recognize you all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| And it only took them three years, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| I didn't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| They did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| And if I can get everybody to stand up that's from CAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| this is just a small representation of the 296 people who work hard every day to keep Knoxville rolling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=638)|
| 0:10:45| keep it moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| And these three folks behind me, if you will give us the opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=647)|
| 0:10:53| they're going to let you know who they are, what they do, and what the award means to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| And do you want to show the video first or after they speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| Why don't we show it after they're done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=661)|

| 0:11:08| I've worked for CAT for a little bit over eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| And I think the award means the most because it just shows all the hard work that everybody at CAT has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| to, you know, achieve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| And it's also nationally recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| And we basically just want to keep striving to provide a good service for the community and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=679)|
| 0:11:25| And that's our main goal in the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=688)|

| 0:12:10| And to me, this award means that we have a chance every day to go out there and give people opportunities to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=730)|
| 0:12:18| reach their jobs or that class in school that's going to actually change their lives and allow them to thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| So I'm very excited to be part of this, and we'll keep doing our best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=750)|

| 0:12:40| The video that they're going to show now is the video that was produced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| and shown at the awards banquet to highlight CAT and what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| And I just want to give a shout-out to Andrea here because Andrea did a lot of the work on this video,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| and she put this together, and it's pretty cool to have somebody that's this talented working on your team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=771)|
| 0:12:58| be able to produce this kind of video for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| Knoxville Area Transit is a diverse workplace in a welcoming city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| With about 3 million passenger trips annually, CAT offers 23 fixed routes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| three downtown trolleys, football shuttles, and paratransit services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| With the support of Mayor Madeline Rojero and Knoxville City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| CAT has expanded services on mainline and neighborhood routes with later options and more frequent service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=800)|
| 0:13:27| Partnerships are the key to its success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| A statewide maintenance alliance shares information and bus orders, saving up to $70,000 per vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| And the downtown business district's marketing partnership is making CAT's trolley system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| not only a great way to get around, but also one of the main attractions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| Local microbreweries and coffee shops host CAT's creative outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| that has brought new people to the table to talk transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| But its most important partners are its employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| so CAT encourages communication, camaraderie, and problem-solving among departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| CAT is so proud to be recognized, but knows it didn't do this alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| and is grateful to all of its community partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| I also want to recognize Dawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=850)|
| 0:14:25| I want you all to know that in this Metro Magazine, this September-October issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=865)|
| 0:14:33| eight women in transit across North America were recognized, and Dawn is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| So she is also recognized among her peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| So thank you, Dawn, for the excellent job that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| And I was thinking we have people who – so, Andre, you've been here for less than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=885)|
| 0:14:56| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| A little bit over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| A little bit over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| And then I see Melissa, you've been here 34 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| Anybody more than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| She was actually born on the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| She was born.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| She was a little bitty baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| So, I mean, we've got folks who've been here their entire career, almost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| and people who are just starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| And it's a great team, and I couldn't be prouder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| Thank you for the service you provide to the residents of this city every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=921)|

| 0:15:58| A lot of things are happening in the Bearden District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=958)|

| 0:16:23| I'm hoping they get around to putting a cool cat sign on the side of the bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| with a panther or a cheetah or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| I think that would be really nifty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| Maybe it could be the bus that runs to the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| I think we need cool cat running in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=996)|

| 0:26:31| approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| So we're within the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1592)|

| 0:26:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| Well, you might mention that one of the things we're doing other than stormwater is the bike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| lanes, the on-street parking, wider sidewalks, people amenities that are going to help improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| the growth of that part of North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| And one thing that coincides with that is the linear park that we're including at Baxter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| Avenue near the food co-op and next to the Knox Central Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1619)|

| 0:27:09| really help improve the aesthetics and also reduce the amount of runoff that's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1633)|

| 0:28:16| Mr. Hagerman, if you would, it looks like from the information in the information sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| that we're about to wrap this up next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| Could you just expound on, we're partly catching up on quantities that are different than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| estimates we all worked with and we're extending the date, but we're going to finish at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| end of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| Is that still the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| It is essentially complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| There may be a couple of minor things that I don't know about, but with the completion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| of the street print on the intersections, it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| So the change order enables us to adjust the price to pay for the additional materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| and work that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| There is, partly because of the other construction that was going on, it got delayed a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| longer than we'd like, so there was some temporary safety measures that we did that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1744)|
| 0:29:12| we had to take back out, so that cost a little bit more, but mostly it's final adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| on quantities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| Kind of cleaning up and counting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1761)|

| 0:29:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1764)|

| 0:29:29| Closeouts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1769)|

| 0:31:39| work or is this totally independent and we're just trying to wrap this thing up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| This is totally independent and we're trying to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| Because of scheduling delays from TDOT, it's really hard for us to be able to predict when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1910)|
| 0:31:57| they're going to work, so we're just going to go ahead and do our separate project here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| It's got a June 30th, 2019 date, so I didn't know why the extended time, but maybe you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| could explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| Just approvals are slower coming from the state, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| Oh, well, it's going to take more than a year to do the job, and we will get started around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1936)|
| 0:32:27| the first of next year, maybe a little before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| So that just gives us a little bit of breathing room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| The green light is slow in coming, is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| Yeah, well, there's always going to be some delays about getting approvals from TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| Coordinating designs and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| And we're not quite done with the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| So this isn't, I mean, this isn't, we still have to bid it after we finish the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| so there's still going to be some approvals along the way, so actually getting to construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| early part of next calendar year is probably a little on the optimistic side at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| Will traffic just totally be rerouted around that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| We have to take the bridge out completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| What does that do to the local businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| How do they get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| From both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| The ones...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| Coming from Broadway and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| Yeah, coming from Broadway and coming from Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| And from Gay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| Well, I mean, you can't get there directly from Gay, but there will be a pedestrian route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2001)|
| 0:33:28| under the Gay Street Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| Well, that road goes around the ramp, but I guess you probably, with the staging of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| the equipment and stuff, you can't drive in a construction zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| It's too small to make it, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| But it will provide an opportunity for a pedestrian connection there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2028)|

| 0:34:46| Councilman Delamonte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| Of course, this is a great project that we're going to hope to get underway where we sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| of find a new use for that area of Jackson that was subjected to the terrible fires several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| It does, this particular item gives me a little bit of heartburn, and the heartburn stems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| from the notion that we're paying $410,000 for a third of an acre lot with no building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2105)|
| 0:35:13| on it, and I asked today for a copy of the appraisal that would have been done from an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| independent appraiser and found out we did not have such a thing, that we negotiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| the price, and I understand the process, but frankly, as much money is involved, I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2124)|
| 0:35:32| we might have had an independent appraisal to help us know that we were not overpaying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| I mean, as a city, we could condemn this land if we had to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| I know we don't like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| I know we don't like to take property from our residents, but I have no yardstick to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2141)|
| 0:35:48| decide if that's a good price or a too big a price, and I wish we had more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| So, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| I'm going to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| I would like to ask Dr. Lyons to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| One thing is, yes, we could take it, but we do not, but then it limits what we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| with it if it's a taking, and Dr. Lyons, you want to talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| Yes, thank you, Mayor and Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| Really, the landscape for being able to use eminent domain for ultimate private development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| which we envision here, as many of you know, was changed after the 2005 Kelo decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| so we arrived at what we thought was a very fair price within comparables that we saw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| and it was what the property owner said that he needed to have, so getting to a voluntary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| outcome on this, we thought, was fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| Were we to try to use eminent domain with the powers we have under the State of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| we'd have to commit to keeping that for public use, and that would have severely constrained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| our ability to go through a vision process with the community on what should happen on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| that whole spot, and we saw very little reason to go down that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| In fact, the eminent domain process, just to add one other twist, even were we to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| that, the way things have worked in the state, you may be familiar with the City of Nashville's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| Convention Center, where they held out with one recalcitrant rather than cooperative property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| owner, and they went from paying what they were going to pay, which was $15 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| to an ultimate jury decision of $30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| So all that taken into account, not wanting to commit to public use, the limits we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| under state law in the post-Kelo era, reaching a voluntary solution with the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2244)|
| 0:37:31| with the comparables that were in hand, and able to consummate that deal, all added up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| to go ahead and tying it up while the opportunity...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| I think you missed the major thrust of my point, which was that it would have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| I think, prudent to have gotten an independent appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| So we knew fair market value, and maybe you think you had enough comparables to get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| but we don't have anything in our packet that shows whether this is in line or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| Well, I do understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| I think the issue was there were two years of negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| This price is the lowest, this is the highest that, I say the lowest that the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2278)|
| 0:38:07| would have accepted, independent of any appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| He had his own idea of what it was worth to him, it started much higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| So I do appreciate that, it just would not have aided us in reaching a voluntary end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| to it, because this is what he said he needed, and speculated on the future value of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| property, and a number of other factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| So I understand what you're saying, this gave us a chance to do it quickly, and didn't constrain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| us by having something that the owner couldn't live with, and forcing us down a legal route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| that we thought would have ultimately been really damaging to the potential future, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| I take your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| I'm just thinking, as stewards of the public, money's counsel, at least, would feel comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| knowing that we have verification in the marketplace that that's a fair price, and that was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| thrust of my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| I'm going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| We don't look at the TDOT appraisals, the comps, and the property assessors, so they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| did have some that they looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| We were under the top line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| So it's not totally devoid of any appraisals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| Thank you, I just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| A visioning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| You mentioned a visioning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| Dr. Lyons, what would you envision, and what do you envision for the process, and when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| would that take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| Well we do envision, prior to proceeding with any redevelopment, we're not going to any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| RFP or anything to that extent, it's too big and too important a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| Hearing from the community through a public process that we would design to hear about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| the general scope and massing that would be appropriate there, the approach that we might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| have, and then moving to a request for proposals based on that, possibly working with KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2375)|
| 0:39:43| In terms of timing, we've gotten all out of whack on that because of Broadway, the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| of the Broadway Viaduct, and then the construction of the Jackson Ramps, and we can't do any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| of that too early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| I mean, you know, to be ahead of the thing or get to an RFP, that would be stale by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| time somebody could actually begin construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| We'd like to get to it as soon as possible in the next couple of years, but we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| have liked to have gotten to it a lot sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| But does that include design proposals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| You could be acting on that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| Well, I think we'd want to put some general constraints that would guide requests for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| proposals, we generally do, but to have a lot more specificity in the kind of design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| we'd like to see, like there are questions, do we mimic the older design of warehouses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| etc., which many, some might like, but we heard from some at one meeting that that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| a flawed approach, maybe you want something a little more modern, but to involve a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| of expertise in the community and involvement by citizens into really what that incredibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| important piece of property would look like in its general outlines aside from just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2440)|
| 0:40:47| scope of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| I think this one, a description of the look and feel we'd like is more important, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| we've heard from council, of course, the importance of considerations of design as well on other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| I hope that you consider the backside of the building, which is the face to the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| of our city, so they need to have a decent appearance from the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| Indeed, that's part of what the challenge is and why it's so important, it's the postcard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| to our city as everybody drives by in the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| It's so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| 11N is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute all documents necessary for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| to accept the transfer of 32 parcels of property in the Lonsdale neighborhood from Knoxville's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| Community Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| Council, we have two people signed up to speak in favor of N, O, and P. Would you like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| go ahead and hear them now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| The first is Mr. Melvin Kyle, followed by Mr. Lynn Clemmons, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| So Mr. Kyle, if you would come up, I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| We're happy you're here, and I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| I'll let you know when you're about a minute out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| My eyes crossed when you said N, O, and P. I wasn't looking at the labeling of the items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| N, O, and P. The next three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| Mr. Kyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| My name is Melvin Kyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| I live at 1504 Delaware Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| It's located in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| I come to you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| I want the project to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| Our kids now don't have nothing to do with this coming to Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2531)|
| 0:42:27| They'll be able to go play ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| First, I want to recognize the Lonsdale kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| Can y'all stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| My grandbaby's asleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2557)|
| 0:42:44| We have that effect on people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| Thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| Council, when y'all address Lonsdale, first you need to address the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2569)|
| 0:42:58| People that's coming to you do not live in Lonsdale anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| I am a stakeholder, and I'm planning to buy some more property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| I just want to say this, and I'll let Mr. Clemmons finish it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| I've called some of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| Y'all talked to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| I mean business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| I just think Lonsdale don't have nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| We have nothing out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| You go to East Knoxville, they get the Chang Center, South Knoxville is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| It stopped in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| I think the Council owes us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| I think as I talked to some of you, you agreed with me, but tonight I need your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2616)|
| 0:43:44| Our kids need your vote, because we don't want to be in here ... I'm not saying it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| going to stop gang violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| It goes on everywhere, but it can limit it a little bit, and with y'all help, y'all can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2632)|
| 0:43:58| help me, because every morning I get up and walk the neighborhood, pick up paper, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2638)|
| 0:44:06| do a lot of other things, talk to my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| We need your help tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| Mr. Clemmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2655)|
| 0:44:21| While he's coming up, would everybody from Lonsdale please stand, show us all who's here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| Thank you all so much for coming out tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| Mr. Clemmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| From my point of view, I've been in Lonsdale, born and raised my whole life, and I was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| police officer for the last 23 years, and I can tell you, I'm going to give you a quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| history of why I think we need this center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| While I was in high school, I remember a friend of mine, Mr. McKenzie, got killed in the basketball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| They took those away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| We had playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| They took those away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| Our community center got taken away also because of violence during the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2694)|
| 0:45:01| So the way I look at it, we need something back in Lonsdale because we have nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| It really isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| And I know there's some new playgrounds out there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| When I grew up, we played, we had a good time, and we enjoyed each other, but now you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| nothing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| And I'm not trying to bring everything on the city, but as you look through the history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| everything we had has been taken from Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| Go back and look at the basketball courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| They was dug up at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| The playgrounds was dug up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| The center was closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| It was on Badger Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| So what do they do now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| Gang violence, get in trouble, hang out, nothing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2720)|
| 0:45:26| And I think it's our fault as a community and as a city that we haven't provided them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2726)|
| 0:45:37| anything for them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| And I've been the last 13 years picking up kids from Lonsdale, and east side, and west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| and all over North, coaching football at 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| I know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| I have been to people's kids' homes, who has nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| has no kind of guidance, no kind of family things at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| And this will be a staple in the lives of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| to help them grow and become productive citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| give them something to be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| It's not just about the sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| because you're gonna get music,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| you're gonna get education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| you're gonna get everything you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| And I'm asking this as a fair chance for these kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| and for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| It deserves this, and I implore you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| to vote and help us out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| because everybody's talking about what they should do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| and shouldn't do, but no one's ever coming to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| and trying to give anything to help out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| I'm the type of person, give it a chance, you never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| And it's all, life is all about chances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| and we don't give the kids a chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| or the community a chance, it'll never grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| So like I said, I've been around a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| I know the problems, I've been in the trench lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| I've been helping kids my whole life, and I enjoy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| I don't only expect anything back from it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| but I know the struggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| I know kids that I pick up who would never be at practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| if I didn't pick them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| If that center's there, or them fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| they can walk to practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| They can walk to Bible study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| They can walk to tutoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| There's a big difference when you can walk there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| but if your parents is going to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| and you have nothing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| at least you can get some kind of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| or something that you need in your life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| you might even get a meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| So there's a lot of things that can come out of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| so to be a negative, we should be positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| because everybody say this and that about Emory Youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| but we're gonna talk to them and hold them to the fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| but I think they're good people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| and they want to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| So I'm proud to have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| I'm glad they want to invest in my community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| and that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| Councilman Dallinopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| I think, like most of my colleagues on this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| that we're all excited about this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| and we're excited to see it get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| We have seen what Emory Youth and Steve Diggs and company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| have done over on Dale Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| as well as at the Emory Youth School and Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| and I think it's encouraging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| and I think it's smart to invest in our young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| and get them on the right track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| rather than try to dig them out of trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| when it's too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| I think this is a healthy thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| If Mr. Diggs wants to say something to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| I'd appreciate it, but that Dale Avenue complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| that Mr. Sampson got behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| is really first class in terms of quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| but also class in terms of the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| that kids will have to have healthy, disciplined activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| rather than hanging around and getting into mischief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| that nothing good comes of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| So I'm excited by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| and Mr. Diggs, if you've got something to tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| about your plans there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| take a minute or two and tell us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| because if the council will allow that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| I think it's really a worthwhile thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| Well, thank you, Councilman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| and Steve Diggs, Emerald Youth Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| I live on Ledgerwood Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| and I am encouraged about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| I just want to make sure I say on the front end, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| that this is a vision of the people of Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| and they've been asking and hoping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| for something like this for some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| and we were just fortunate to be able to be a catalyst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| and be able to bring the nonprofits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| that have come together to form the LLCs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| to do the capital funding for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| and also to share in the ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| and the partnership going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| So in a lot of ways, we see ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| as being just a smaller part of a bigger picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| that's been in place for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| But you mentioned the Sansom Sports Complex on Dell Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| and that definitely happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| because, too, the city council got behind that project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| and it became more than what we ever imagined it being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| in a short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| and we think that can be replicated again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| and even more so with more activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| as we do plan to have a comprehensive approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| that will include a faith development piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| as well as a learning center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| for older youth and young adults,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| a fitness center that will be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| by all ages in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| two gymnasiums that will allow for many indoor gym sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2990)|
| 0:49:56| as well as the outdoor fields for soccer, football,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| other activities can be offered as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| So we think it's gonna be just a great light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| in that community and give young people a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| not only to have a fun place to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| but also a place that can prepare them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| to become young adult leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| in our neighborhood and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| But it'll happen because the people behind me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| and the people across Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| that I know that are gonna really invest largely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| So we look forward to be able to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| and to provide some leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| and encouragement to the people there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| and I think that you'll be proud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| of what comes out of the result of this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| Keep doing the good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| Mr. Diggs, before you leave, one quick question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| and I think it's a great project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| and I plan to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| With the older youth and young adults,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| we have any type of job training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| or resume preparing or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| The focus of the program will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| what we call a calling and career prep initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| and that's all gonna be lined up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| trying to make sure that they're ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| for college and post-secondary education and training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| and also help engage them getting into the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| So we do plan for that to be a part of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| making sure they're prepared to go on for work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| And as far as the children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| will you include in a preschool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| or what age range are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| We will primarily serve school-aged children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| through that young adult age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| I see, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3097)|
| 0:51:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| I would like to add that this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| that this support from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| for this sports complex and education center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| is part of a long-term commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| that this administration, I know Mayor Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| when he was mayor and Mayor Haslam before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| has had to work in concert with the Lonsdale community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| You know, in addition, and it's right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| somebody mentioned the change center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| I think this is a perfect complement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| The change center will be east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| This will be west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| As a matter of fact, we've rerouted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| we are rerouting the buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| so that the buses coming from Lonsdale downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| will go by the change center first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| so that the kids from Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| can take that and won't have to change buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| at the transit and be delayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| and therefore not have any incentive to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| Becky Way's department in community development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| has been working for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| in identifying blighted property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| buying it all as a result of community meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| with many of you in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| In fact, the land that we're making available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| is available because community development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| over the years has purchased the blighted properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| and created that land so that something of use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| to the community that would be of great value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| to the community could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| We've had a number of energy efficiency upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| through our Knoxville Extreme Energy Makeover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| that have been done in the Lonsdale community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| so neighbors have benefited from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| We've continued to support the community schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| which the Lonsdale Elementary is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| and so there are services after school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| through community schools and Project Grad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| Part of this project is the sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| and infrastructure improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| that the city will do, some million dollars or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| in order to serve the whole neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| and to enhance this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| So those are just the playground that was mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| working with neighbors in Lonsdale homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| Gerdau, the city, and KCDC created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| or constructed the children's playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| for the younger kids there in Lonsdale homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| So I want y'all to know that we've been committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| to Lonsdale and we'll continue to work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| This isn't the end all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| We wanna see this built but we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| there's still many needs in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| and we will continue to work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| We ask that you stay organized like you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| It's easier to work with you when you are organized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| and come together through your neighborhood groups and such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| but we'll continue to work with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| and we look forward to this being a success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| and for us to continue to work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| to rebuild Lonsdale so that every person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| who lives there will benefit from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| So, yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3263)|
| 0:54:31| Okay, state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| My name is Clifford Reynolds, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| Burnside Avenue, I'm a resident of Lonsdale as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| But one thing that, I'm for the complex, 100%, love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| I think it's something that we've needed for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| but I have a concern with what are we gonna do after this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3286)|
| 0:54:52| What are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| Lonsdale has no economic development at all, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| Every dime that I spend in my Lonsdale community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| leaves my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| So, we don't have anyone within our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| that owns anything as far as a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| So, what we need to do is look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| what our economic development is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| and what funds and grants are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| for those in the community who would like to start a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| so that we can try and keep some of our money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| So, hopefully we have a plan for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3329)|
| 0:55:29| And by the way, I would just add that anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| if you know of folks who are interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| in starting businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| we have the Knoxville Entrepreneur Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| the Urban League has a program to help entrepreneurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| They have a community development financial institution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| a CDFI that can help to fund good business plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| So, there are resources available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| So, if you know of folks who wanna start a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| or need help with an existing business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| should contact my office so we can put you in touch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| with some resources available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| Okay, so, anything else from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| We have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| 11-0 is the resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| to enter into an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| with the non-profit Sansum Hackney LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| and the non-profit Haslam Lonsdale Project LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| for the sale of real property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| within the Lonsdale Redevelopment Area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| at fair market value to be redeveloped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| as a multi-purpose recreation, art, and education facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| for the children and youth of Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| and the greater Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| A motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| Councilman, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3403)|
| 0:56:43| I'm reading these papers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| it did talk about a 15-year lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3404)|
| 0:56:45| but nothing after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| Is there a right to renew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| or are we just gonna deal with that later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| How are we dealing with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| That's a long period of time, I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| and it's a great opportunity to do things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| but what happens after 15 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| Is it disintegrate, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| Well, again, I'll reiterate a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| of something I said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| What I am real encouraged about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| is both Bill and Liz of Sansum and their foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| in forming this non-profit LSC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| and then Jimmy D. Haslam doing the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| on their side with their non-profit LSC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| They wanted to make a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| to stay in this project as a partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| and not make the investment and walk away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| So number one, I think that's very encouraging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| and that's the right model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| What's second is this is very much typical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| of the kind of model Emerald Youth Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| has worked with for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| Our Central Street facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| our gym sports facility there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| the former St. Mary's Hospital in Altenova| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| before it became a for-profit hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| had the same arrangement with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| and then after 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| then we have the opportunity to look at a renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| Now we own that property there on Central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| but the Sansum Sports Complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| is a very similar model as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| but it's only a 10-year lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| Our board just asked these two families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| to consider the 15-year agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| and then we'd sit down and negotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| going further after the 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| Grow as you go is what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| That's right, and it gives everyone a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| to make sure we have the capacity to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| and that we're the right organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| to keep going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| But overall, that's gonna be a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| and an operation there for many, many years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3501)|
| 0:58:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3506)|
| 0:58:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| 11P is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| to execute all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| to accept the transfer of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| adjacent to Sam E. Hill School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| in the Lonsdale neighborhood from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3517)|

| 1:00:09| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3609)|
| 1:00:10| No problem with the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3610)|
| 1:00:10| I'm just curious, is there a Boomsday in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| or is that kind of off the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| Well, remember, Boomsday was originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| Visit Knoxville then took it over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| and then they couldn't, because of the costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| and the new way that businesses market post-recession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| there wasn't the sponsorship available for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| So these are for city-sponsored events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| Right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3632)|
| 1:00:33| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3637)|
| 1:00:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3638)|

| 1:01:01| We're now down to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| Two people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| First is Kenny Riffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| Is Kenny here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| Oh, there you are, Kenny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| I didn't see you back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| Was Rhonda Gallman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| Is Rhonda still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| She was sitting over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| I don't know if she left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| She might come back in before five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| But Kenny, you go first, and I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| Please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| I'm Kenny Riffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| My address is 2320 East Fifth Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| and I live in Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| And as you well know, that will be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| coming up on your agenda very shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| In the next one or two meetings is the expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| of the historic overlay in the Park Ridge District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| And I just want to reopen the topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| I spoke to you a little over a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| My concerns about the fact that the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| was not engaged in the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| that a small group of people asked the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| to take a look at putting a historic overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| over almost 1,000 houses in one of the lower income areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3718)|
| 1:02:03| in East Knoxville, and to create a very restrictive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3723)|
| 1:02:09| situation for many of the lower income homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| We have had a number of meetings where people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| have shown up and expressed their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| And at the end of each meeting, it's thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| We'll see you at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| And we keep wondering why our no's are not being heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| The MPC passed through the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3748)|
| 1:02:35| to expand the overlay, and so it will again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| come to city council next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| But Gerald Green, who is over the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| I have heard him speak in a number of different venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| And he's used the example before that in a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| where he used to live that was turned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| into a historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| He said even he couldn't live there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| because it's so expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| So again, we're taking a lower income area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| putting a historic overlay on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| and it potentially will become a very expensive area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| And we have seen housing prices increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| just because of the market pricing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| or the way the market is performing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| We remain concerned for the lower income residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| who live there, their ability to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| and repair their homes under the restrictive guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| that come along with a historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| We are currently on the National Register| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| of Historic Places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| That's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| We are recognized as being historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| But putting the overlay on those houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| means that we all have to abide by a set of guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| And those guidelines tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| how we have to maintain our homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| when we have to make repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| So I'm here reopening that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| recognizing that it's going to create difficulty for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| And I know that you'll be hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| from many of the residents in Park Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| over the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| But I also want to take a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| to thank these kids for coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3856)|

| 1:04:25| what's going on in your neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| Stay aware, be aware of what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3867)|

| 1:04:34| And I thank you guys for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| Park Ridge, you'll be hearing from many of us out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| Thank you, Ms. Ruffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| Okay, Rhonda Gallman, did she come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| Okay, she's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil171024?start=3886)|
