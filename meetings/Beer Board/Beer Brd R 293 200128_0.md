| 0:13:38| have any thoughts on when you'll be able to get all these accomplished? For at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| least 90 days because we ran into more problems we could shake a stick at but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| we're gonna get it fixed before we decide to open. Okay so it sounds like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| 90-day delay would be your request. That'd be fine. Okay. Do you want to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| questions? Do you feel like you can do it in 90 days or you think you want a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| little longer because if you come back sooner. It's gonna be done 90 days. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| Okay good. So I will move to approve a pending final. No to extend 90 days. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=847)|
| 0:14:16| let me get it right. Thank you. Okay. I'll second the 90-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=856)|

| 0:15:06| looking about a month out to open up and get everything ready. Do you think you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| can do it in 30 days or would you like 60 or 90 days just to make sure? If I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| take 60 days can I turn it in and get it sooner? Yes. Okay yeah 60 days to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=917)|
| 0:15:25| on the safe side. Move an extension for 60 days. All right motion is second. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=925)|
| 0:15:34| Aye. Thank you. Good. Okay that ends the regular agenda. At the bottom of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=934)|
| 0:15:44| agenda you see other business and so what I wanted to do here was just have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| discussion about your board procedure policy and potential goals that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| be looking at. I always think when you're starting a new role it's a good practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| to survey where you are and then give some thought to where you might want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| go. So in that I spoke with our friends from the tax department who had helped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=960)|
| 0:16:07| me out a bunch and they let me know that before our meeting tonight we had 794| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=967)|
| 0:16:14| active beer permits. From the beginning of 2018 through the end of 2019 there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| were 194 approved applications. The number of applicants appearing before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| the beer board actually increased by almost 16% from 114 in 2018 to 135 in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=986)|
| 0:16:34| 2019. I also asked Sergeant Coward to give us a little indication of kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=994)|
| 0:16:41| enforcement side of things and his sting operations. Go ahead Sergeant Coward. Sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| the stats since I took over as supervisor of the inspections unit in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1006)|
| 0:16:53| 2017 we conducted 16 compliance checks for the year. We visited 418| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1013)|
| 0:17:01| establishments. We had 78 that sold to us, 340 that did not, 78 citations issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1021)|
| 0:17:11| for sale to underage and one arrest made and that was a failure rate of 19%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1031)|
| 0:17:18| of the businesses sold to us. Excuse me Sergeant Coward, could you speak a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| closer to the mic? Yes ma'am. For 2018 we did nine compliance checks for the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1043)|
| 0:17:30| visited 185 establishments, 34 sold to underage, 151 did not sell, 34 citations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1050)|
| 0:17:39| were issued to underage with 18% failure rate of the businesses. 2019 we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| did nine checks, 185 establishments visited, 26 sold to underage, 163| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1065)|
| 0:17:53| did not. The total number of citations issued for sale to underage was 35. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1073)|
| 0:17:59| reason that we had more citations issued than establishments that sold, we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1079)|
| 0:18:07| multiple sales at different venues which came up to be about a 14% failure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1087)|
| 0:18:13| rate for the businesses. So three years totals was 34 total checks, 788| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1093)|
| 0:18:22| businesses visited, 138 that sold, 654 did not, 147 citations issued, one arrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1102)|
| 0:18:33| and that put us at a three-year 18% failure rate of businesses selling to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1113)|
| 0:18:40| underage. The thing that I think is very important in the three years that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1120)|
| 0:18:50| been the inspections unit supervisor and we've conducted a compliance check, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1130)|
| 0:18:57| have not failed to catch at least one business during our operations. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1137)|
| 0:19:05| interesting thing about that is every business that has a beer permit is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| mandated by city ordinance that they have to show up to KPD before they get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1151)|
| 0:19:19| their permit and then annually after they get their permit for alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| training and we are training them exactly how we do our underage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| compliance checks. By state law we are mandated our underage cadets have to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1168)|
| 0:19:36| the real ID. We cannot do anything to try to trick the vendors at all. If our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1176)|
| 0:19:46| cadets are asked any age-related questions they have to answer truthfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1186)|
| 0:19:52| and like I said we are training owners and managers on how we do these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| operations yet we still catch someone every time. The one that I find most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1198)|
| 0:20:05| telling is the Garth Brooks concert. We conducted an underage compliance check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1205)|
| 0:20:13| there with ABC agents. It was ABC agents operation and they literally told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1213)|
| 0:20:21| Aramark that we were going to be there at that concert. We still caught seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1221)|
| 0:20:28| people there. Thank you Sergeant Coward. I also wanted to ask Mr. Frost if he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1228)|
| 0:20:36| could talk to us a little bit about what actually happens when somebody gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| cited. Thank you Chairman. So when they do a sting I guess Sergeant Coward or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1239)|
| 0:20:47| whoever's along the clerk will get a citation. Then as it applies to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1247)|
| 0:20:54| the permit holder, I'll send this out later on, it's essentially laid out in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| ordinance 4-78. The first bad sale is the permittee has to submit a remedial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1259)|
| 0:21:13| plan. A few years ago the beer board said we always ask for a remedial plan after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| someone messes up. Let's go ahead and start them thinking about the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| beforehand so they can plan on hopefully avoiding messing up and that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| that's synonymous with what you hear as the plan for server compliance. So if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1289)|
| 0:21:36| someone is caught, the permittee in most circumstances does not pay a fine and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| they must submit their remedial plan to KPD and you all don't hear about it. Now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| however, if that first sale is to a person under the age of 18, it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1308)|
| 0:21:57| minimum of $1,000 fine and you go straight to the hearing officer. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1317)|
| 0:22:04| hearing officer, it actually rotates between five different locally licensed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| attorney to hear the matter. It's prosecuted by Allison Dyer in the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1329)|
| 0:22:17| department. The police are involved and anybody else that needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| involved is there. People can bring witnesses with them. They can submit any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| information they want to for consideration. Now if a permittee picks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| up a second offense in what I call a rolling two-year period, I mean if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| have, for sake of argument, you have your first offense January 1st, 2017 and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1359)|
| 0:22:45| don't have your second offense until January 2nd, 2019, those aren't within two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1365)|
| 0:22:52| years of each other so that first offense or that second offense would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| officially be a first offense because it's not within that two-year period. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| if you are within that two-year period, things start to ramp up as laid out in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1380)|
| 0:23:06| you know 4-78. You have to submit a remedial plan but this time you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| also pay a $500 fine and you have to pay that fine before you come to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| board for an administrative hearing. At the administrative hearing, the permittee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| is here and they will verbally tell you all what they plan to do to correct the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1403)|
| 0:23:31| situation, where they messed up and how they're going to try to fix it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| hopefully go forth and send no more. Now sometimes a permittee might take the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1417)|
| 0:23:47| situation less than seriously. They might not have a plan at all. You might not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1427)|
| 0:23:54| feel that the person is being genuine in their what they plan to do or their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1434)|
| 0:24:01| response to the infraction. It is up to you all to decide if someone has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1441)|
| 0:24:09| adequately addressed the situation and then it will end right there or if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| want to send them on to the hearing officer where the hearing officer will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| have a hearing and may impose additional fines, suspension or in the worst case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| scenario a revocation. You know a few years ago there was a business on Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| Hill which I think they just messed up a lot to be blunt about it and they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| suspended by the city and suspended by the state for something like 30 or 45| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| days which was just huge and so that I mean that really ate into their bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1482)|
| 0:24:50| line and I think got their attention because I haven't heard of them coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| back anymore. But back on your second offense if you sell to someone who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1495)|
| 0:25:02| under 18 years of age the minimum penalty is $1,500. Well and then if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1502)|
| 0:25:09| sell for three times or more in that rolling two-year period you all don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| even hear about it because it goes straight to the hearing officer. It's you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| know a permittee has got a real problem if they're making three bad sales in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| rolling two-year period. I mean that's basically the gist of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| Thank you Mr. Frost. Did anyone have anything they wanted to ask questions of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| Go ahead. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I just question for Sergeant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1536)|
| 0:25:43| Coward. First of all I'd like to thank you for the reports that you send us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| the work that your team does. It's very helpful and I always look through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| those even if I don't respond. It's just good information for us to be reminded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| of. So my question for you is the decline in the number of visits. That's not what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1556)|
| 0:26:06| you called them. I'm sorry but the technical term for when you're going out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| and doing these operations. Compliance checks. Between 2017 and 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| What happened there? What happened there was in 2017 we did a lot of checks with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1575)|
| 0:26:25| ABC. As a matter of fact we did one where we actually checked 68 total businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1585)|
| 0:26:33| in one night and we operated two separate teams. The primary reason our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| numbers are down is due to our cadet numbers are down and it's just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1598)|
| 0:26:45| personnel and scheduling problem. Thank you. I think that's just one more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| reminder to all of us the dire situation we're in and making sure that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| recruiting officers into the force. So thank you again for everything you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| and I know it's a lot of work and you guys do a good job. Thank you so much. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| really appreciate that. Any other questions? Well and I know Mr. Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1623)|
| 0:27:10| talked a little about the server the plans for server compliance and as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| all know that's the the plan that we ask that get late that lays out how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| business is going to prevent underage service as well as over serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| customers. That actually was added to the beer permit applications in 2017 and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| 2018 we passed guidelines for server compliance plans which are now in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| application. In 2018 only 5.2% of the applicants appearing before the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| board did not have a server compliance plan in their application. That number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| dropped to 4.4% in 2019. So we're getting more of the server compliance plans. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1664)|
| 0:27:51| at this point I think what I wanted to just sort of close with is you know I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| like us to be proactive but then also be data-driven in future action that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| board may take. So I'd like to begin with the following commitment if you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| are agreeable to it. We're very close to having a hundred percent of all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| applicants turning in a plan for server compliance that we can all review in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| packet before they come to see us here at the podium. I'd like us to try to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| to a hundred percent this year. Is that something you all would be supportive of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| Absolutely. I don't know what other requirements we can make of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1705)|
| 0:28:32| There were a couple and it's no reflection on the people that turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| them in but the ones that are handwritten are sometimes harder to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| and I had trouble with a couple of those. So I don't know if we can require that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| they be typed or at least on a form that we provide. Something to consider. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1725)|
| 0:28:53| and that's really what we're doing today is discussing that. I mean I think I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| make a pitch. Okay. I know that people are going to say Wi-Fi and connectivity digital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| divide be a thing but all libraries provide access and so there's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| opportunity. Okay. Yes. We could put legible. Yes. Legible. Print. Does it say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1749)|
| 0:29:17| print? Yeah. We could also look at the standardization of the remedial. Like if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1757)|
| 0:29:25| there's a form that we could provide so that it kind of organizes the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| information. I mean I know that we were trying not to be real boxy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| Well the server compliance plans I mean it's different strokes for different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| folks. I mean it really matters on a number of businesses. Yeah. You have mom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| and pops that are just starting out and you have multi-state corporations that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| will submit 20 pages and you know mom and pops likewise can be serious but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1788)|
| 0:29:55| don't need to can't come up with 20 pages. So just I'd encourage it to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| legible. Okay. That's my request. Sergeant Coward. Also the server compliance plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1801)|
| 0:30:10| the state mandates that people with off-premise only beer permits they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1810)|
| 0:30:19| to card everyone. So those would differ a little bit between you know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| off-premise versus the on off-premise permittees as well. Thank you. Any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1826)|
| 0:30:33| comments about trying to get to a hundred percent for server compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| plans? Okay. I'd also like us to ensure that our fines are appropriate to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| facilitate further reductions in underage sales. We just reviewed what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| fines look like right now. Would anyone like some research done on what other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| jurisdictions do for fines? I think that would be very appropriate just so we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| have something to just kind of look and see where are we as it relates to other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| cities that are our size and their fines. Thank you Vice Mayor. And make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| no one else okay. And I'd also like us to review the number of compliance checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| that we have as Sergeant Coward just talked about and if we wanted to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| recommend to KPD if it might be helpful to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| Councilperson Welch. I'm sorry my comment is not necessarily about that but it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| about I guess I just have a question about I don't recall approving any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| permits without a compliance plan. It seemed did we? Okay. It feels like we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1895)|
| 0:31:43| said like postponed for 30 days but we have actually approved them. Oh okay. Not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| not very many. I won't be here but I would commit to not approving any that don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| have that I mean I thought we were requiring them to have the server| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| compliance plan. Am I wrong? Mr. Frost do you want to address that? I thought some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| had been postponed because the idea is that someone could put something you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1922)|
| 0:32:07| know just we're gonna ID and that would put the business tax office in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1927)|
| 0:32:14| middle and they don't want they want black or white they don't want gray. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| seems like I remember having this discussion that we were not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| just post we weren't going to say approved pending because that was an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| unfair burden to y'all like what's what's a good compliance plan and what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| not. Right we don't want to evaluate the plan we we can check mark yes we got it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| or we didn't but the evaluation of whether it's adequate would fall to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| board. Ms. Dyer I think if I remember correctly a conversation with your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| office I believe all of the applicants from the last year had actually turned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| in a server compliance plan what we're talking about here is that they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| turned it in in time for it to be in our packet so that the the beer board can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| review it in writing is that correct? Yes I mean I think you're talking about two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| different things you have had them turned in the day of right in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| packet that you've received on the night of the meeting but I believe what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| talking about. I think I think if you have been approved subject to final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| documentation I understand the board's goal was wholly not to do that but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2002)|
| 0:33:28| not I don't know that we've accomplished that. Councilperson Testerman. Just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2008)|
| 0:33:35| curious going back to because there are different types of businesses but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| would it be would we have the ability to outline just minimum standards and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| guidelines that everyone would have a starting point as they're putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| together this plan to help guide them whether they're new business owners or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| whatever you know or templates or that kind of thing to allow them to see what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| other establishments might be. Well if you get in if you prescribe a form I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| mean respectfully they're not going to try to be creative or try to take it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| improve on it they're just going to turn it in and somebody can come in and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| after they've been caught well I did exactly what you all told me to do and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| then try to turn around and pin it back on you all. So I would respectfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| suggest that the the best way is to I mean people can look at accepted plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2067)|
| 0:34:34| for server compliance because their public record and you know come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2074)|
| 0:34:40| their own I mean the the basics are there in complying with the law you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| if you have to card or not for any and all transactions and those type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2085)|
| 0:34:52| issues but I would suggest getting away from creating your own policy for others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2092)|
| 0:35:01| to try to comply with. Fair enough. That was actually part of the discussion when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| dealt with the server compliance plans guidelines last year and what we ended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2106)|
| 0:35:12| up on was that if you know if we spelled it out exactly then we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| to get that sent back to us. What we really wanted to do is engage in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| thought process so they would think about the applicant would think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| what they were going to do to prevent underage service over serving and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| send that back to us. So we want to have them think about it. Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| Okay. Councilperson Ryder. I was going to say well now I forgot what I was going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| ask about but anyway I just was going to say I looked it up because it's been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| while since we looked at it but for those who are new to Beer Board in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| of that making them think about it we gave them a whole page to think about. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| couldn't remember if we gave them a form or we had a lot of discussion about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| but it's a full page of things to think about elements they might include. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| still get some that are a little brief and non-descriptive but I think I do I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2160)|
| 0:36:07| have seen that we get more. I think the confusing part now I remember what I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| going to talk about is the ones where we do approve pending final documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| but we have actually gotten the server compliance plan in our seats when we got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| here. So can we not there's just no deadline this is a rolling deadline kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| of I mean I hate to delay somebody 30 days. We serve at your pleasure. I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| we serve at your pleasure. We can not put them on the agenda if they don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| certain things. For instance we don't put them on the agenda if the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| is not in by the first of the month so that it can be but I mean we will react| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| to what the board desires. Anyway that would be my only encourage everyone that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| comes in that this is the deadline to get it to your stuff in right the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| is is not right and favorable to receiving it the day of they right I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| have to answer to that meeting but it's just something for us to think about if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| we want to give them a hard deadline this month it was only two I think or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| couple but the problem is some months it's five or eight and you're like oh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2231)|
| 0:37:17| let me sit here and read these while we're moving at the speed of light I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| mean that's not realistic. The purpose of this conversation is really to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2240)|
| 0:37:26| that thought process and then if you have something that you want to bring in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| the form of a motion obviously you know talk to Mr. Frost about it. The idea of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| move pending final documentation is an applicant who has those items not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2256)|
| 0:37:43| complete yet that generally speaking are outside of their control. The fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| department hasn't come by, building inspections has not come by, task class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2267)|
| 0:37:53| is kind of an exception because task class meets what weekly 50 weeks a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| so that's easy to do and that's a that's a box checked or unchecked type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| thing so but the things that are within an applicant's control are their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| fingerprints or background check and obviously a plan for server compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| is likewise within the applicant's control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2296)|
| 0:38:23| Next person Parker. I had a question and then another thought came to mind as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2303)|
| 0:38:31| folks were talking so I'll say my thought that came to mind first just as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2311)|
| 0:38:39| a a nonprofit director hosting a temporary festival I've gone through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| beer permit process and I know that it can be you know stressful to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2325)|
| 0:38:54| you're meeting the deadlines before your event is coming up but I don't remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| the server compliance piece to it is that also included with these short-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| festivals and then to add to that it sounds like if you submit you know a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2343)|
| 0:39:11| one-sentence statement that I'm going to check all the IDs of anyone who attends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| the event is sufficient. Am I hearing that correctly? Are there certain things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| that each council member is looking for when they're reading a plan? That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| probably an insufficient plan for server compliance and they might be encouraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| to work a little harder. And I think where you're hearing that from is if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2371)|
| 0:39:39| were to pass something without a server compliance plan on pending final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| documentation then you could basically have a cover letter that says server| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| compliance plan and we're putting it on the business and tax office to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| decision. That's not what we want to do so we want to have everything in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| packet so we can review it and then if you found something that you thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| wasn't adequate you could ask the applicant about it. Did you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2399)|
| 0:40:05| another question? No, that was both. Okay, all right. I'm going to go. Councilperson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2405)|
| 0:40:12| Fugate, I think you were next. Yes, being the newbie I'll ask the question. So if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| because I agree with what our attorney Frost said, Mr. Frost said that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2418)|
| 0:40:26| impose deadlines about what we will or will not accept if it's within their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| purview to do it. So how does one go about that if this body chose to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2431)|
| 0:40:41| I'd put something together probably have it for the next beer board meeting. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| mean. And can any councilperson request that you do that? Yes. Okie dokie. We'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2446)|
| 0:40:54| talking. Vice Mayor McKenzie. And so I also agree that server compliance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2454)|
| 0:41:02| is a controllable that any applicant should be able to present that when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| first you know come before us. We at a minimum should have that. I do think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| I like the way the direction this conversation is going in because you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| know Chair Roberto you were very adamant about server compliance when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| came on the beer board. I think that that was a great direction that you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| taking us in and I think that you know I think we have an obligation to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| that anyone that comes before us has a server compliance a plan and that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| have the opportunity to look at it. So when they do stand before us even if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| we're going to approve them pending final documentation we have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| opportunity to review ask questions if we think that it is not adequate we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| give recommendations for them to update it. But I would be in agreement that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| as a as a governing body that we need to be much more diligent as it relates to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2518)|
| 0:42:06| server compliance because when Sergeant Cowan is going out they're going out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| they're doing these checks and a lot of times people probably say well you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| we went along with our server compliance plan that may be one that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| have not even reviewed or looked at had the opportunity to look at and it could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| be very scarce that is not their responsibility to say is it appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| or not I think that that's our responsibility. So I don't know if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| need to have additional conversation or if since we've got it going we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| look at going ahead making a recommendation but I'd like to defer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| you for for guidance. I think at this time what I'd recommend is getting some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| thoughts on what everyone's thinking. If you feel moved to you know bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2564)|
| 0:42:51| something up talk to Mr. Frost about it we can put it in an upcoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| beer board agenda. We wouldn't be able to take action on this I think Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| Frost because really what the announcement was we were going to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| about these things we weren't going to vote on them so I think we'd have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| defer that but this is a really good discussion which is what we wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| see. I think I got it from Councilmember Fugitt. Do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| I didn't make that clear. She's not direct at all. I'll also check with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2596)|
| 0:43:24| business tax office because I think it's important whenever you're preparing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| something like this or an ordinance or something you always check with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| people who actually apply day in and day out to let's make sure we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| unintentionally causing headaches. The best thing that any applicant can do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| turn everything in early because if there are problems they come up and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| mean yesterday I thanked Mr. Townsend and the the opera company. They were great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| They turned in everything super early. Greek fest you'll find that's the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| way too. It's when somebody turns something in at the last minute and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| there's a hitch and you know you try to move heaven and earth to help somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| out and sometimes there's just not enough time but you know with the opera| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| company situation we're working to get them taken care of and you know we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| address the situation as well. One last thing I'd like to go back to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| point that Councilmember Parker brought up as it relates to festivals are just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| limited event. Would that server compliance look the same as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| establishment server compliance? I don't think it would because a festival is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2672)|
| 0:44:41| going to have a plan for security you know that might have you know bike racks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| or gates up like the for example the ordinance that we did two years ago for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2686)|
| 0:44:53| certain events on Cumberland Avenue it was pretty specific in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| barricades no glass containers and things like that so that type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| temporary thing is totally different from traditional four walls restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2703)|
| 0:45:10| So let me take that a step further so even though we're in a contained area is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2710)|
| 0:45:17| the requirement that we know that IDs have been checked because there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| wristband? So I mean what does that look like? Well I mean I know the opera| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2722)|
| 0:45:31| company for the Rossini Festival does wristbands. I know that when we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| having the discussion last year with Aramark that they did not want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| wristbands for Neyland Stadium or Thompson Bowling Arena. I don't think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2741)|
| 0:45:48| don't prescribe wristbands at all. I mean it's up to someone to take the steps and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2748)|
| 0:45:55| comply with the law whether or not they have wristbands. I mean I think it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| be easier if somebody had wristbands but that's a business decision. So I guess in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2758)|
| 0:46:08| essence their compliance plan basically would be the same because you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| checking every ID every time a person comes up to purchase a beer or an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| alcoholic beverage if you're not doing the entry checks with wristbands. Okay. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2777)|
| 0:46:24| do think that it would be definitely something that I think we should and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| think we're already seriously considering making some changes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| looking at potentially that being a requirement that we that we have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| those for review moving forward. Okay. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| Councilmember Ryder. Brief question. I've never taken a task class and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2801)|
| 0:46:48| know if I need to but anyway or if I'm volunteering to. The task class can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| be taken every week except for two of them apparently. Is the task class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| something that would be helpful to somebody who was drafting a compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| plan? Like oh I would have written this in there had I taken had I'd written my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| compliance plan after I took my task class. Well and. Is it relational? Most of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| most of the folks have already been through it at least once. We also you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2832)|
| 0:47:19| know tell people if they need help drafting company policy or compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2839)|
| 0:47:27| plans or anything like that we would certainly be happy to help. Okay. When we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| think about deadlines or how we want to hold fast about not getting these when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| we get here if that was somehow relational and should be considered. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| and one thing I'd like to bring up about deadlines is they they know from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2860)|
| 0:47:46| moment they pick up paperwork from Ms. Dyer's office that the background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| is a absolute. If you don't get it done before the beer board the board will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2872)|
| 0:48:00| consider your application. They hear it from my office. It's also part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2880)|
| 0:48:06| paperwork as well. Yet we still struggle every single meeting with people running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| late on getting their background checks in. All right. Any other questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2892)|
| 0:48:21| comments? All right. I think that was a really good discussion and I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| everyone's participation and that will be a conclusion of your beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| meeting for today. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200128?start=2909)|
