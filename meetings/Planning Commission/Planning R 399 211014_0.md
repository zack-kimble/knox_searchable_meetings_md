| 0:15:45| and is more compatible with the surrounding area of the current zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=949)|

| 0:16:17| I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Harper Properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| in regard to the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| We have submitted, as noted, a request for a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| and one-year plan amendment and a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| Presently, the sector plan has been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| Presently, the sector plan and one-year plan for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| is office designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| and the current zoning is heavy industrial, IH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| As noted, staff report recommends approval of the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| and one-year plan request from office to General Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| and for the rezoning from heavy industrial to CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1011)|
| 0:16:58| As required in approving sector plan amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| there are certain elements that must be established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| We submit, as noted in the staff plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| that such elements have been established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| in the need for this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| One is the change in conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| Here we have a mix of different uses in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| including commercial, office, and multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| We've got parcels immediately adjacent to the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| where there has been a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| to a General Commercial designation from an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| That wasn't that long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| Right now, there is an indoor self-storage facility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| That was in 2017 that that sector plan was amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| and that a rezoning occurred on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| changing it to a General Commercial use as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| That evidences the changing in the conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| the trends of developments in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| transitioning from these dated, outdated plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| and outdated uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| There's General Commercial not only adjacent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| but it's prevalent in the area, whether to the west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| the south, and also to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| we have General Commercial designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| As for the rezoning, the request for CG1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| we submit that it's compatible with the surrounding area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| and such a rezoning is a logical extension here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| Submit that the majority of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| surrounding us to the south is owned by the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| Central Baptist Church of Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| and it's created almost a node there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| a standalone node of office designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| We'd submit that that's likely based on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| being a longstanding church there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| The general intent of the CG zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| is to provide a mix of retail, personal service office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| and certain residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| I believe when you look in the surrounding area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| all those are substantiated within the immediate vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| This property is the only property zoned heavy industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| I scanned out as far as I could and noticed no other designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| and likely because heavy industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| is a very impactful zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| When you look at the permitted uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| within the heavy industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| you have distribution and warehouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| you have heavy industrial that's permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| With that comes not only the direct impact on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| caused by heavy industrial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| but also the impact coming and going from the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| such as semi-trailers, 18-wheelers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| trips back and forth from this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| We'd submit that it'd be a desirable location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| considering the close proximity to I-40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| and the interchange there at Paper Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| When you consider these heavy industrial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| of warehouse and distribution and heavy industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| you're contemplating uses dealing with processing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| and manufacturing raw materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| As noted, there's a sub-comment in the ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| that talk about and discuss heavy industrial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| and it points out that they're clearly not compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| with areas designated for institutional, office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| and retail use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| I don't think there should be any contention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| that heavy industrial is an appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| or dispute to say that's still an appropriate use on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| I ask that you amend the second plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| as requested in the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| and rezone the property to CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| Thank you, Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| Mr. Cain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1252)|
| 0:21:07| Pardon me while I get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| I want to get up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1269)|
| 0:21:36| Let's do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1296)|
| 0:21:53| I'll try to get that where at least most of you can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| John King, PO Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1318)|
| 0:22:06| I'm here on behalf of the Central Baptist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| its congregation and members, in opposition to this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1330)|
| 0:22:18| I think probably a good thing to get to the point pretty quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| so I'm going to try to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| I want to reserve a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| I have one member and a manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| from the church education department who wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| I'm sure a lot of you think, what's my complaint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| Because this is a rezoning to get rid of a piece of industrial property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1361)|
| 0:22:49| in essence a down zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| Sometimes that's a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| Sometimes it's better to look at the way you're trying to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| This is one of those second things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| If you look at the maps of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| you'll find that all the property is zoned CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| It's dotted around the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| Front's on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| That's where it fronts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| There's a little piece in there zoned C2, just a little strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| I don't know when that occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| but it has some really small businesses in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| The rest of the picture is there's office zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| which adjoins us on the western side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| There's other office zoning in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| But the most important thing is the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| and the one-year plan have for years recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| that this piece of property be used for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| The purpose of amending those plans to get to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| is to try to find the highest and best use of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| and move it in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| What the staff and others at MPC have been saying about this piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| is best use is office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| If you read the staff's analysis about the reasons for the change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1463)|
| 0:24:32| what you'll find is, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| there are no new roads or utilities to justify a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| This is what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| Two, no error or omission in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| Remember, the plan right now says, oh, office zoning for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| Number three, no changes to the development pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| or completion of public improvements that would warrant plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| Four, no change in public policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| that would trigger the need for a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| Five, no new information has become available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| to change or show the need for a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1512)|
| 0:25:24| You have to have reasons for a plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| and in this one what they talk about is the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| over a period of time of mixed use in and around the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1529)|
| 0:25:37| What's happening here is the applicant's proposed use requires rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1537)|
| 0:25:46| and that required rezoning gives a chance to amend the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| so the rezoning can then take place and everything ends up CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| Please note, if you would, the same thing would be accomplished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| if you simply rezoned the property to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1563)|
| 0:26:10| It would be in conformity with the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| and it would be what the recommended use has been for years for this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| The church has had a foundation there for many, many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| and they're very concerned about this proposed use to the point that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| after consideration of all of these matters, they've asked that the matter be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| I'd like to recognize Ms. Carmel Hall who would like to say I've told her she's got about a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1596)|
| 0:26:45| You've got less than a minute. It's 15 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| 17 seconds. That's not quite a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1607)|
| 0:26:56| Hello. My name is Carmel Hall, and I'm 1041 Morrow Road, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| and I'm the Family and Children's Minister here at Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| Our main concern is the reuse of the Anderson Road because it's right between the back of our church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1625)|
| 0:27:12| which is the main entrance for our preschool weekday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| which is over 170 students that cross that road frequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| and also on the other side is the Bloom Center where individuals with special needs receive job training from our church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1639)|
| 0:27:28| and we work with Knox County Schools doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| Sorry. I think 15 seconds is about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| It would just cause great harm to not only the children but to the church congregation as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| We have 3,000 church members, and at least 800 to 1,200 will use that road to frequent going to worship services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1663)|
| 0:27:53| But if you want to give me more time, I'm happy to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| Thank you, Ms. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| Chair will recognize Commissioner Tim Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| Mr. King, I have two or three questions I'd like to ask of you, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1690)|
| 0:28:21| In regards to the letter, I'm trying to make sense for myself on this letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| so I know there was one suggestion about changing, I guess, the plan amendment or leaving it as office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1707)|
| 0:28:39| Heavy industrial allows for office, doesn't it, so there would be no need to change for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Well, the plans, it's difficult for me to explain, but the plans say office designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1725)|
| 0:28:58| The proposed use is not permitted in the office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1738)|
| 0:29:06| So they have to—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| Have they proposed a use for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| They have to—excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| I said have they proposed a use for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| I may have missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| Was that in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| Car wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| Okay, but we're not looking at the use right now, are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| I don't think I—I didn't intend to bring it up except for one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| That is, since his proposed use can't be done in the way the property is currently planned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1766)|
| 0:29:36| he has to amend—he has to change the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| In order to change the zoning, he has to first adopt amendments to the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1780)|
| 0:29:47| And so what I was saying was that's how—if you read the staff analysis where they talk about reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1787)|
| 0:29:56| for proposing a change or recommending a change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| they said it was—that there had been a mixed sort of growth north of the railroad tracks out to Dean Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1802)|
| 0:30:13| I would observe—I think between like Wisely Harbor and all the way off that map going west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1813)|
| 0:30:23| there's not any residential development in the area where the church is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| There's some, as I say, small CG1, but it all orients to Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1829)|
| 0:30:44| There is other office in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| As a matter of fact, there's a portion of one piece of property zone, O, that adjoins us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1847)|
| 0:30:56| But it's a one-two punch, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| Well, I guess what I'm trying to understand, this thing is—we're looking at heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1862)|
| 0:31:09| And I'm just trying to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| They have heavy industrial by right, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| So I'm just trying to imagine that if this is used as heavy industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| how could it ever be more compatible than a CG designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| which states that it's most compatible with mixed uses such as office, residential, churches, retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1887)|
| 0:31:37| So I'm concerned more for the church as to what it could be under heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| I mean, I think of dump trucks and outdoor storage and salvage yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| Just looking at these permitted uses, an impound lot, I couldn't think of anything worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1910)|
| 0:31:57| But it's possible and by right on that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| I understand any of those uses I'd be opposed to, and I wouldn't be happy about somebody trying to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1922)|
| 0:32:07| But they have it by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| But I would observe that's been the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| I don't know how long it has been zoned heavy industrial for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| Maybe some of the staff can tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| My point is I think it's important that the church and its members understand that these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| I would call them toxic uses to the church, that they have it by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| And this CG, assuming that they're, and we're not considering uses today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| but whatever use that is, it would be deemed compatible or it would go for a special use review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1957)|
| 0:32:46| Well, that's the reason I'm suggesting that what you can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| rather than amend two plans and adopt new zoning, why don't you just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1971)|
| 0:33:02| They didn't apply for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| Why don't you use what you can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| We can't just zone without an applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| You can rezone this piece of property to O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| You don't have to amend any plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| We don't have any requests for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| Well, you have a request for rezoning, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=1998)|
| 0:33:25| We can discuss it at some length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| But, in fact, you can rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| He filed a zoning application, and there's no limit on your ability to zone it whatever you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2013)|
| 0:33:43| There's nothing in the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| There's nothing in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| I just want to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| I want the public to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| I want them to understand what heavy industrial is, and then I'm going to wrap up, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| The purpose statement for I.H.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| the heavy industrial zoning district is intended to provide for a wide variety of general manufacturing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2038)|
| 0:34:04| fabricating, processing, distributing, and warehouse uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| Industrial uses in the I.H. district may result in some moderate external effects, such as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2049)|
| 0:34:16| I want you to hear these closely, smoke, noise, glare, or vibration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| and typically include outdoor storage and related outdoor activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| I support the church and protecting the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| but I just have a different view of how we would protect the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| Well, I understand, you know, that's been looked at and considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| The church leased that property for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| At an option for extending for another 10 years, they decided it did not meet their needs anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2083)|
| 0:34:51| and they weren't going to lease it any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| Now, they understood from that time on that there was a piece of property zoned industrial right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2094)|
| 0:35:02| We don't need to discuss at this point what efforts there may have been one way or the other with respect to that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2102)|
| 0:35:10| The current applicant says that they're going to buy the property no matter what it's zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2110)|
| 0:35:18| that it's a good piece of property, and they want to acquire it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| and they were going to buy it whether their request was approved or not approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2121)|
| 0:35:29| There have been all sorts of discussions about how to deal with that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| Let's say it's not here that we spend all the time discussing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| but what I want to make a real point of, just because he did not ask for office zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2138)|
| 0:35:46| does not mean you can't give him office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| Your rights up there as members of the Planning Commission are to recommend the best use for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2151)|
| 0:35:59| when you get into a rezoning situation like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| Mr. King, if I may interrupt, I think our purpose here today is to review this application for rezoning and vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2163)|
| 0:36:12| I don't believe right now we should be considering any other zoning classification other than that was requested by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2172)|
| 0:36:19| Mr. Chairman, all I'm asking is-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| Mr. King, I appreciate it, but I'm going to open it up for Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2181)|
| 0:36:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Commissioner Hill did a very eloquent job expressing exactly how I feel about this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2190)|
| 0:36:37| I think the heavy industrial doesn't make any sense on this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2197)|
| 0:36:44| and I think it's actually deleterious, it would be seriously deleterious to the church's function to leave it zoned the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2204)|
| 0:36:51| Based on that, I'm going to make a motion that we approve the West City Sector Plan Amendment to G.C. General Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| per staff recommendations and based upon staff's reasoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2217)|

| 0:37:31| Mr. King, not at this point, no. We've finished public comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2251)|

| 0:38:01| I make a motion by Commissioner Roth, seconded by Commissioner Uten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| to approve C.G. General Commercial zoning per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2284)|

| 0:38:18| There may be a brief disturbance as these people leave, but I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2298)|
| 0:38:25| Next on the agenda is item number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| This is a sector and one-year plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| File 10B21SB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| The applicant is Len Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| Location, south side of Sevierville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| southwest of intersection of Sevier Avenue and Lancaster Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| Size of tract is 6,650 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| Present plan and zoning designation is LDR low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| RN2, single-family residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| Proposed plan designation, NC neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| Existing land use is single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| Staff recommendation, approve the south city sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| to NC neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| Classification because it is a minor extension of an existing neighborhood commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2357)|
| 0:39:24| Second recommendation, approve the one-year plan amendment to neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| because it is a minor extension of an existing neighborhood commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| And rezoning, approve CN neighborhood commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| because it would allow for additional commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| at existing walkable commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| I see the applicant is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| Mr. Johnson, would you like to go first or would you like any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| Is there any opposition to this request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| Seeing none, Mr. Johnson, give your name and address, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| My name is Len Johnson, 724 Taylor Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| I also have Mr. Tabeel with me, who is the owner of the Roundup Restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| And to make this short and sweet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| basically we're responding to the extension of the sidewalk facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| from up Lancaster to Sevierville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| that basically goes on our east and north property lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| And the reason we're asking for all these changes is to incorporate an existing residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2429)|
| 0:40:36| into the same zoning as the restaurant itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| and it is the Roundup Restaurant in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| And that's all I've got, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| Thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| Chair will recognize Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| I had a quick question about if you can go to the screen that shows the aerial view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| and the yards that abut the strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| That's it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| I just had a question about the buffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| I think neighborhood commercial there makes a lot of sense because what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| Can you hear me, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| No, I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| That mask is not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| I know. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| I was asking to look at this particular view because of the way that the property in question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2476)|
| 0:41:24| has aligned to residential homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| Yeah, basically that whole area, that whole block on Alpine is R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2487)|
| 0:41:34| And this piece of property that we're trying to have rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| actually belongs to Mr. Tabea, the owner of the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| And the reason we're doing this is because of the sidewalk renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| And one of the issues that we have, it's not one issue, it's several issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| is that basically as a result of that sidewalk going in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| Mr. Tabea is losing all of his grandfather's situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| And for those of you that understand what that means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| it's a substantial difference in what that restaurant's going to be in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| As a result of that, we're going to have to pick up parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| and redo the parking lot in order to pick up those spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| because we're losing about eight to ten spaces as a result of the new sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2538)|
| 0:42:24| So that's the reason for the rezoning and the sector plan and the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| My question is about the buffering that helps with those residences there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| if that parcel becomes, if it's voted to become neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| what buffering is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| So this may be a question for staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| just in terms of protecting those residences that are R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| Commissioner, you'd like Commissioner Albertson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| not the commissioner, but staff to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| Liz, you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| Sure. I'm Liz Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| I'm a planner that reviewed this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| In section 11.3 of the zoning ordinance related to off-street parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| it's my understanding that this may be a parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| So there are additional setbacks that are required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| when non-residential use is adjacent to a residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| So an interior side yard or rear setback is required for parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2601)|
| 0:43:28| And I believe in this case, it's actually kind of adjacent to right-of-way on the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| but on the rear portion of the property, it is adjacent to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| And that would be, I think, an additional 20-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2617)|
| 0:43:45| Thank you for clarifying. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| Seeing no other comments from the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| the chair will entertain a motion to approve the south city sector plan for staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2631)|

| 0:45:21| Location, northwest side of Kane Road, west of Cecil Johnson Road intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| Size of track, .78 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| Present zoning is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| Zoning requested, RN2 single-family residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| Density proposed up to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| Staff recommendation, approve RN2 single-family residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| because it is compatible with the sector plan and existing zoning in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2751)|

| 0:45:57| Your name and address, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| My name is Robert Kitt, 4917 Kane Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2759)|
| 0:46:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| Mr. Kitt, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| A couple items I don't know if they've been addressed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| This section of Kane Road is unimproved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| It's only about 16 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| It is not lined, and in certain places it is deteriorating on the edges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2782)|
| 0:46:29| The property, I have no idea how many houses Mr. Branscom intends to put there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| but the drainage for his lot drains onto mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2794)|
| 0:46:40| So what's going to happen is any driveways or roof drainage is going to end up on my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2800)|
| 0:46:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| That's two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| Second item, depending on how he builds, he may be building over top of current sewage lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2811)|
| 0:46:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| And what part of building this is the driveway going to take up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| Is that included with the square footage for the houses or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| Well, right now all we're considering is the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| We're not considering any site plans or any development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| Well, all other properties on that side of the road are agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| My property, which is the part marked AG right there, is 338 feet along that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2847)|
| 0:47:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| So is putting this in with unimproved road, you know, where two cars can barely pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2861)|
| 0:47:54| is that considered compatible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2874)|
| 0:48:01| That's up to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| That's up to the commission to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| I said that's up to commission to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| Well, that's new information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| And like I said, if he builds, I don't know how many houses he intends to build there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| He had it surveyed and it looks like he had it surveyed for four houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| But I can't tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| Again, all we're considering right now is the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| Do you have any other comments you'd like to make a part of the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| Well, I think I've covered what I needed to cover other than the fact that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| like I said, the road is unimproved, no lines, narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| and two cars can barely pass on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| I mean, you see the gray area, which is the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| but the road is actually the two lines in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2931)|
| 0:48:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| Like I said, I've only received this notice about ten days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| And, you know, just more consideration, I had no input to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2946)|
| 0:49:13| to any of the people that looked at this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2953)|
| 0:49:19| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| Thank you, Mr. Kitts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| Seeing no other comments, Chair will recognize Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| I'm the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| Chair will recognize Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| Yeah, I was just noticing this rezoning would allow up to two units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| and this is 0.78 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| So I don't think we're talking about a big development here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| So I don't see any issue with the rezoning if the plan complies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| I don't think there would be any issues building on sewer lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| They're going to have a survey and avoid that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| Am I missing something, or is it in a 0.78 with two units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| you're not going to get two units, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| A little difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| Chair, we'll entertain a motion on the rezoning, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| Mr. Chair, I'd like to make a motion to approve our N2 single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3019)|

| 0:57:03| I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| You'll defer, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| Please give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3430)|

| 0:57:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| I don't really need five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| My name is Nancy Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| My address is 6726 Ball Camp Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| And I really have a lot of questions about it that I would like answers to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| such as the designation that it has now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| that you're just going to, like, approve it because it's close to some other properties that Mr. Maddox is developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3454)|
| 0:57:42| I want to know where that stops, and I want to know where, like, what's planned for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| I live directly across from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| And I have a neighbor here also that lives directly next to this property that's been applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3471)|
| 0:58:01| So I don't really know how to ask the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| I don't know if I can spend a little time with Mr. Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| But we don't want just – and there's other neighbors in the area that weren't able to attend today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3487)|
| 0:58:13| that really don't want to see it turned commercial because it's our only little buffer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3493)|
| 0:58:20| It's a small, narrow piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| But it still provides a buffer from the Shad Road extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| and, of course, the Food City that's directly across from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| So I want to know the plan for it, what it's going to look like when it's done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3513)|
| 0:58:39| how it's going to impact Ball Camp Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| It's an extremely busy area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| I don't know how many people up here or back here use that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3524)|
| 0:58:50| It's where Ball Camp Pike comes into the new Shad Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3530)|
| 0:58:55| Lots and lots of traffic, both on the new Shad Road and Ball Camp Pike also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| So how do I ask my question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| Ms. Scott, what I'm going to do is I'm going to ask Ms. Albertson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| to discuss the current mixed-use special district and current zoning and let her –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3546)|
| 0:59:15| Yeah, and how it's going to look like from my point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| which is directly across the street from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| So today all we're considering is the rezoning of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| We're not looking at a site plan or any details of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| We can't consider that in this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| Right now it's strictly what would be permitted in a general commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| But I would like to be able to ask some questions of the person who has applied for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| so that we as neighbors are going to know what to expect in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| With that, I'm sure the applicant, Mr. Maddox, will be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| So, Liz, would you mind explaining the current plan and the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3595)|
| 1:00:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| If we could get the sector plan turned on, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| The sector plan is the long-range land use plan that was adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| for the northwest county sector in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| Is that the red area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| The red area is shown as commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| That's what Mr. Maddox would like to change the land use plan to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| The current designation that's in right now is in a mixed-use special district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| It generally allows for a mix of office and residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| Even though it's like that, I mean, technically it's agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| That land has been agricultural for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| So this is a long-range land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| so this is looking at how growth would happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| So that's what the sector plan shows for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| It was anticipated that there would be a mix of uses at this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3650)|
| 1:00:56| because of major shod road improvements that went in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| as well as the improvements to Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| Well, I have a question then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| Where does it stop there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| Like let's just say that this gets approved for the designation that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3668)|
| 1:01:14| Maddox is requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| Does it stop at the next property that's, you know, like looking at the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| it would be like down, it would be like the one that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| well, it would be down from where it's hash marked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| What's your street number, Rick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| 6825.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| 6825 adjoins this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| Now, is that eligible to have its designation changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| So for each rezoning, if a property owner submits an application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| part of that process involves staff sitting down and looking at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| surrounding land uses, what the land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| which is the sector plan, says for an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| and then what any major infrastructure improvements may have happened in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3722)|
| 1:02:03| So, you know, we look at everything on a case-by-case basis when it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| to a plan amendment and a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| I can't really tell you right now without having done a bunch of research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| what staff would recommend moving forward for additional rezonings in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| So what currently is the current designation of the mixed-use special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3744)|
| 1:02:30| district and hillside protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| Did Mr. Maddox previously request that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| It was just already there in the overall plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3764)|
| 1:02:45| So in the overall plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3765)|
| 1:02:46| does it extend beyond this property at 6805 Ball Camp Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3766)|
| 1:02:52| If you zoom out, you can see where the mixed-use special district is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| See the purple hatching there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| This is where the entire mixed-use special district was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| So actually that GC used to be part of that mixed-use special district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| and as part of the Grassy Creek development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| it was requested to be rezoned from general, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| to general commercial at this location, which is the CA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| And so then the land use plan also had to be amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| which is similar to what's happening today as far as the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| and that happened back in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| In 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| So technically this expansion or commercialization of Shod Road could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3811)|
| 1:03:39| continue on down Shod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| It would just be on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| It would be case-by-case basis, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| And do you answer any questions today about accessibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| you know, how the property is accessed from either the current Ball Camp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| Pike or the current Shod Road, or is that just all up to the developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| So at the time of rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| we don't require a transportation impact study or plan at the time of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| Because it's been my understanding, I could be wrong about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| that there has to be a certain amount of access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| like driveway cut-in and all that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| And that's part of the overall planning of it or approval of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3862)|
| 1:04:28| So that would be handled if the rezoning is successful and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| Maddox goes to pull permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| He'll work with Knox County Engineering to decide where the best access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| location will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| and he might be able to give you some idea about his plan for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| Well, thank you all for your time, and I'll listen to Mr. Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| Thank you, Ms. Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3893)|
| 1:04:54| Mr. Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3894)|
| 1:05:00| I'll be glad to answer all their questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| We'll meet here just immediately after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| We're also working with Knox County Engineering for improvements to Old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| Ball Camp Road and the intersections that she mentioned now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| We're working on that at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| Actually, it's under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| And the access to this, we're planning on using Shod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| There is a median cut through there already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3924)|
| 1:05:29| so everything's there existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| And basically what we're doing here is we're just squaring up the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3932)|
| 1:05:37| line of the property that we've got there previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3937)|
| 1:05:43| So we're just requesting the rezoning and the plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| Mr. Maddox, for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| I just need your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| Steve Maddox, 100 Dalton Placeway, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| I heard comments from the applicant and some of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| Commissioner, do you have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| Mr. Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| I've been out and looked at this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| It's going through a whole lot of changes right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| and I feel like it's justified for a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| So if it's appropriate, I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| It's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the Northwest County sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| plan amendment to GC and hillside protection because it's a minor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| extension of the existing commercial adjacent to the improved Shod Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=3988)|

| 1:09:11| Mr. Sharp, you're present, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| Sharp, if you give us, oh, there is opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| Would you like to go first, Mr. Sharp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| Would you like opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| I'll defer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| Applicant's deferring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| Ma'am, if you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| Hi, my name is Amanda Wells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| I live at 5119 Lonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| Oh, there it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| So I'm number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| The proposed rezoning is surrounding our.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4178)|
| 1:09:43| Just one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| Oh, you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| Is there a reason this screen is moving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| I'm not sure what happened, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| But sometimes if you scroll it up and scroll it back down, it will turn on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| Let's hope it doesn't continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4196)|
| 1:10:20| I'm sorry, Ms. Wells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| Oh, you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| So we just purchased our home this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| So when we were looking at it, we expected there to be homes that went in behind that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| because it surrounds our property by two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| But Zone 3 allows for enough of a change that we feel that the character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4238)|
| 1:10:48| and our ability to enjoy our home would be greatly diminished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| So I guess that's where our opposition comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4254)|
| 1:11:01| So one of our concerns is that all of the traffic would come to one outlet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4261)|
| 1:11:09| I think there would be some traffic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| But our main concern is the character of the neighborhood and how that would change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| We're right at the bottom of Timbercrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| So it's really mostly single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| And I know that Zone 3 would allow for apartments and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| So I feel that that would be a drastic change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| Sean Wells, 5119 Lowness Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| To add on to that is really just the watershed issue that, I mean, 24 dwellings per an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4300)|
| 1:11:47| You're talking almost, what, 96 homes or 96 apartment complex just within a four-acre period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4307)|
| 1:11:54| Just this last week, we had a nice rainstorm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| It was about an hour, hour and a half that it lasted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| And, I mean, that flooded out Kirby going down Paper Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| You're adding to the congestion with, I mean, I know there's R and 3 right up the road from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| but it's washing out Lowness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| I don't know if you guys have plans for redoing Lowness, like the water runoff, also sewage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4331)|
| 1:12:19| I think the apartment complex is a little bit further east down Lowness next to South College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| You can see what the effects of water runoff actually is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| The right side or the south side of Lowness Road is just totally washing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4349)|
| 1:12:35| You add more R and 3 in that area, Lowness will need to be addressed as far as utilities, sewage, and water runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4355)|
| 1:12:45| It's just going to add to what's going on down in Paper Mill as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| That's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| Thank you, Mr. Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| Mr. Sharp, your name and address, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| Chris Sharp, 11852 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| I mean, we feel that I understand the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| We're by no means proposing apartments or anything near 28 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4383)|
| 1:13:09| I drew a quick, just a real quick and dirty sketch plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| knowing that there are topographic constraints at the rear of the property and along some of the sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| I think we had roughly 28 to 30 units, all single-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| well, they're partially attached, actually entirely attached single-family, mainly duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4403)|
| 1:13:29| They'll all be fee sample lots, no rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| So we respectfully request that the commission abide by staff's recommendations and approve our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4413)|
| 1:13:41| Thank you, Mr. Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| Seeing no other comments, I'm sure we'll recognize Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| Yeah, I was just going to ask about this sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| And what exactly are we considering the justification for changing the sector plan on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4433)|
| 1:14:03| So for the sector plan amendment, we're looking at it as a change of conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| particularly looking at the increased demand for housing because it's such near employment centers and on a CAT route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4447)|
| 1:14:15| The only reason I didn't include that the development pattern had developed with R and 3, R and 5 already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| was just that the development had occurred a long time ago in the 80s and 90s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| and it felt like it was necessarily relevant enough or recent enough to include that as a change in development pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| But there is an established development pattern of R and 1, R and 3, and R and 5 in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4468)|
| 1:14:34| So under the load, if the sector plan is there now, it would allow-is it right up to five units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4474)|
| 1:14:43| It would allow up to six because it's in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| Okay. I mean, to me personally, I don't see good justification for changing the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4486)|
| 1:14:54| And adjoining this neighborhood of single-family homes, you still have low-density residential all around this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4494)|
| 1:15:04| I just kind of struggle with why you couldn't do something a little more compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| but still higher density with leaving the sector plan as LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4509)|
| 1:15:15| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| Ms. Weld, it's really not at this point. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| No, you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| All right. The chair will entertain a motion on the sector-oh, I'm sorry. Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| Yeah, could I ask a question to the applicant real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| How many units per acre, talking about keeping it LDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4541)|
| 1:15:47| Our very best case would be seven, seven per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| I think it was roughly 30 units, so right at 7.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| And that's the absolute very, very best case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| And I guess the R and 3 gives us a little more setback or flexibility as far as lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4559)|
| 1:16:04| and that kind of thing, which allows us to condense the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| and ideally provide more room, condense the grading toward the center of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| and leave more room around the periphery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| It's not as much a density thing as the lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| We can't go R and 3 and LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| So I think that was our rationale behind the MDR request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| Can we rezone to R and 3 under LDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| LDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| You cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4601)|
| 1:16:42| I just wanted to express that I concur with Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| in the concern that the rationale is the need for housing because it feels like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| and I understand it was need for housing because this also has a CAT line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4611)|
| 1:16:57| and workforce connected to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4617)|
| 1:17:00| but it seems like that could often be applied to many different applications that I tend to agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4620)|
| 1:17:08| that I'm a little concerned about that being the rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4628)|
| 1:17:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| Commissioner Higgins, is your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4635)|
| 1:17:21| Can I ask a quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| Mr. Sharp, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| Did you say R and 3 is allowed in LDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4646)|
| 1:17:27| No, it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| Chair, we'll entertain a motion on the amending the Northwest City Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4650)|
| 1:17:37| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| Since nobody is willing to give a motion just yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| I'd like to talk about it a little bit more if we may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| So I'd like for someone to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| The maximum at 7 versus what they're asking for, they would get how many per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4670)|
| 1:17:58| I want to frame it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| If we zone it one way, we get X.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| If we zone it the other way, we get X potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| So what's the difference that we're talking about here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| Can somebody help me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| It's kind of difficult to say because the city's zoning ordinance doesn't really talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| dwelling units per acre like you're used to talking about in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| or with the old zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| So the LDR and the MDR both still have those statements that it allows up to 6 in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4699)|
| 1:18:25| but it's not in the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| So it basically falls down to the buildable area as determined by the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| Then you look at the building height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| Some of the residential zones have lot coverage maximums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| So all those things need to be taken into consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| and then it applied to whatever size units they're wanting to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| and that's kind of how the density's arrived at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| So it's a little nebulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| So maybe I'll ask Mr. Sharp that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| What would you project the difference being?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| What, six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| Probably six units total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| But under the R and 2, I mean, our lot sizes have to be bigger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4736)|
| 1:19:04| and, you know, setbacks are a little more restrictive if I remember right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| So, I mean, again, our rationale behind R and 3 was to condense things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| It's not necessarily a total number because we're talking four acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4752)|
| 1:19:21| I'm wrestling with, one, if we can justify, as you two have concerns about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4761)|
| 1:19:31| and if we do, do we get a better product?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| And I guess they're two separate kind of issues to wrestle with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| So this is kind of a tough one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| Chair recognizes Commissioner Newton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| If you drive alone, it's been a mix of higher density for a lot of number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4787)|
| 1:19:57| That R and 5 that's, you know, six or 700 feet down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4797)|
| 1:20:03| that property's been developed that way for a long, long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| and there wouldn't be any cat and bus lines on Lowness unless there was a reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| because you've got more density that is happening down Lowness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| I think staff noted that Lowness is a collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4817)|
| 1:20:21| So, you know, as you're looking at infill opportunities with density in different parts of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4821)|
| 1:20:29| I think Sutherland and Lowness and those sorts of places close in west are ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4829)|
| 1:20:35| I think, to Commissioner Smith's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| if this property was more developable at the back of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| as it creeps into that residential, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| I think there may be some merit in how that affects that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| But this particular piece, it's got some hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4852)|
| 1:20:56| Mr. Sharp, doesn't it, at the back of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4859)|
| 1:21:00| It's got some hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4862)|
| 1:21:03| Topo at the back, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| Which, again, is more reason to condense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| Right, so they're going to be developing, I would assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| at the front part of the property, even though we're talking about the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| And it's going to have access off of Lowness, not off the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| And you've got all this higher density stuff, R and 3, R and 5, R and, you know, R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4875)|
| 1:21:22| There's assisted livings down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| I think that that infill-wise, I think it's a good spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| I think staff got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| I'd make a motion to approve the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| Right now, we're at the second point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4896)|
| 1:21:44| Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4904)|
| 1:21:45| Yeah, I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| My concern is I just feel like these houses in this neighborhood wrap around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4907)|
| 1:21:53| and they're across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| I'm not saying that we should do half-acre lots there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| I'm saying I don't think that vertical on two acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| which is about what you're going to be building on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| probably is going to yield much more than LDR would allow you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| And I just think it's more of a better transition from the single-family residential detached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4929)|
| 1:22:16| to more of a not 20 units to an acre, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4936)|
| 1:22:22| something less than that, but smaller lots, which is what I think you'll get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| And then you transition on up to the higher density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| which lines up with Coleman Road, which that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| that density kind of wraps around that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| So my thought is if I lived in one of those houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| I'd like something not exactly what I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| but a little more of a compromise between larger single-family and vertical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4961)|
| 1:22:48| That's all I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| We do have a motion, Commissioner Newton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=4974)|

| 1:25:17| I know Laura's doing this, or it's Allie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5119)|

| 1:25:28| The applicant is the Dominion Group, location north side of Maloney Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| south of Jonathan Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| Tract information is 4.72 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| The present plan and designation zoning is LDR, low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| RA, low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| Proposed plan designation zoning is MDRO, medium-density residential office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5148)|
| 1:25:54| and PR, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| Existing land use is rural residential, single-family residential agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| Density proposed up to 21 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5162)|
| 1:26:06| Staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| approve the south county sector plan amendment to MDRO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| medium-density residential office land use classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| because it provides a transitional land use between the highway corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| and the adjacent single-family residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5182)|
| 1:26:26| Second motion is approve PR, planned residential zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| up to 21 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| because it is a minor extension of the medium-density residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5194)|
| 1:26:39| Mr. Sean Chalmers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| You're the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5206)|
| 1:26:47| And I know there's opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| Would you like to go first or would you like opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| I'll defer to the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5212)|
| 1:26:53| Opposition, if you'd like to come up to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5213)|
| 1:26:58| give us your name and address, and I think there might be more than one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| but if there's more than one of you, you'll have not more than five minutes total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5226)|
| 1:27:07| I'll try and keep it quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| My name is Paul McQuaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| I live at 3107 Ginn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| I've been asked to speak on behalf of some of the downstream landowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| I have 30 years' experience in runoff, drainage, erosion control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| and working with local governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| This particular tract is surrounded on three sides by low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5243)|
| 1:27:30| I feel like there are a variety of other designations without going to 21 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5250)|
| 1:27:37| I tried to ask staff how many people will be in this at 21 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5257)|
| 1:27:43| and they said there's no number for the units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| I feel like there's other designations that might be some condos, some professional office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5266)|
| 1:27:54| You described some other ones with lower density per units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5274)|
| 1:27:59| We understand the need for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| We understand the need for apartments, but calling this a transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5281)|
| 1:28:07| jamming a big apartment complex into what is low-density residential is not a transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5287)|
| 1:28:15| Maybe some condos would be, maybe some small professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| I'd also like to briefly say that all of the erosion calculations and all the runoff stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5299)|
| 1:28:25| you can throw it away because due to climate change, those calculations are just wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5305)|
| 1:28:31| You can look in Humphreys County and what happened over in Waverly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| and those types of rains are going to be occurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| and there's already impacts of runoff from this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| I think briefly, we know that Dominion's goal is to make as much money as they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5323)|
| 1:28:50| and cram as big apartment complexes as they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| and I would hope that your job is to find a balance between what they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5333)|
| 1:28:59| and what's appropriate for the rest of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| I'll defer the rest of my time and hope that you all will protect our rights as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5342)|
| 1:29:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| Sam Jackson, 3104 Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| I'll be brief as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5355)|
| 1:29:16| Thank you all for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| I do think the sector plan, as Commissioner Graf said in the last meeting regarding this plan development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5358)|
| 1:29:24| does call for the preservation of small spaces, and we are actually a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5364)|
| 1:29:30| We are the Braggville subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5370)|
| 1:29:31| Most of the homes in our neighborhood have been there since the 1940s through the 1960s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| when they were originally developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| We do think a traffic study needs to be done for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5377)|
| 1:29:41| Parents have to drive their students to Mount Olive School in this area of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5381)|
| 1:29:47| so there's a one-lane railroad bridge that's going to really be impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| We're already impacted by severe heights on Sundays and Wednesdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| I've almost been hit by a car trying to get my mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| So it is a very busy road, and if you haven't driven down it like you have Lowness and other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| I definitely recommend you please do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| I know our neighbors in Lakemore Hills think this is going to bring development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| However, I would say look at the University Commons development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| You have 30,000 students on campus at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| They couldn't even keep a Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| I don't think this is going to bring the development that they think it's going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| So please consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| Please consider your actions as you get ready to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| Thank you for your time, and I'll defer to my other opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| Thank you, Mr. Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5425)|
| 1:30:30| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| I'm Reid Massengill, 3116 Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| My property is directly across from the two Knox County properties being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5436)|
| 1:30:42| I'd like to thank you guys for the notification postcard alerting me to the hearing for case file 10G21PA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5442)|
| 1:30:49| 6.2 miles away from me in Island Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| I can only assume that happened because of my vocal opposition at the July meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| to the earlier section of Dominion's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| My deed refers to lot 5 of the subdivision of the WR and JIA break bill property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5462)|
| 1:31:10| and I'd like to point out a couple of things and refer to your maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| First of all, for context, when you look at the aerial photograph that is described as your Exhibit B contextual images,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5474)|
| 1:31:24| you'll notice that the two properties that are highlighted that are the subject of today's vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5484)|
| 1:31:29| are directly across from and adjacent to large, approximately two-and-a-half-acre properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5489)|
| 1:31:36| that were subdivided in 1952.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| There are not a lot of us here in opposition because there are not a lot of us in this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5499)|
| 1:31:45| We live on lots with deep setbacks, on heavily wooded, two-and-a-half-acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5505)|
| 1:31:52| We're few in number, but we are great in acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| Likewise, the properties that you're looking at rezoning and changing a sector plan for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5516)|
| 1:32:02| have always been Knox County single-family residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5522)|
| 1:32:08| This rezoning attempt, which, by the way, I'm sure you've noticed that the application is made by the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5528)|
| 1:32:15| not the owners of these two properties, who are separate individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5535)|
| 1:32:21| These properties in the county would have to be annexed to the city in order for the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| to either extend the apartment complex that they were talking about in their July meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5547)|
| 1:32:34| or to build something different and or smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| But that would bring the county into Maloney Road, approximately five acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5558)|
| 1:32:44| directly across from county residences like mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| We have been a very stable, very friendly, very rural neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5568)|
| 1:32:53| We're on a two-lane, unimproved county road that does not have sidewalks, room for a bike lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5573)|
| 1:33:01| We have instead culverts and gullies because of long-term stormwater issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5581)|
| 1:33:08| There's not even shoulders along our segment of Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| And as you may know, it terminates with a five-foot-eleven-inch underpass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| that's one lane before you get to Merrillville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| To Commissioner Smith's comment about the Lowness property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| your staff report, when it talks about the surrounding pieces of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5606)|
| 1:33:33| to the east, single-family residential, to the north, single-family residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5613)|
| 1:33:38| to the south, single-family residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| the only properties that are not single-family residential are the ones that you agreed to rezone in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5621)|
| 1:33:48| which are the larger pieces and parcels that Dominion plans to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| We're very much against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| We do not think that it provides an appropriate transition into a quiet residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5635)|
| 1:34:01| And if one little old church-going lady on a Sunday gets into the new feeder lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5641)|
| 1:34:08| that's just gone into effect in the last two weeks and is unable to merge onto Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5648)|
| 1:34:14| William Shatner will have gotten into space and out of space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| before the last car makes the Maloney turnabout, the roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5657)|
| 1:34:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5662)|
| 1:34:23| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| Mr. Chalmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| Sean Chalmers, 3834 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| As was stated, we presented on July 8th with our concept for rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5676)|
| 1:34:42| which included both city property, which was the focus then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| There was a delay in getting the county parcels just due to securing those pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5685)|
| 1:34:50| But we did discuss the overall project as it's part and parcel of the same concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5690)|
| 1:34:57| We're now at 240 units, which is a reduction from what we initially presented to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5697)|
| 1:35:03| We did understand the concerns about the buffering between the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| and so we've addressed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| The upper northeast corner of the property there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| we've agreed to have an additional setback of about 80 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5713)|
| 1:35:17| to preserve most of that green space back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| and provide additional buffering between the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| Additionally, on the stormwater, we're already working on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| with Knox County and the city of Knoxville with our engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5726)|
| 1:35:30| The plan is to have stormwater retention at both corners of the property along Maloney Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5730)|
| 1:35:36| and to shift as much as possible towards Alcoa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5736)|
| 1:35:40| and staying out of some of the natural drainage areas on the northeast side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5740)|
| 1:35:45| We do believe this is an appropriate rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5745)|
| 1:35:49| as a lot of the issues discussed before really pertinent to the overall project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5749)|
| 1:35:54| And so our reasonings are still the same, that our residents will be utilizing the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| It'll help stimulate some additional development along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5760)|
| 1:36:05| And as far as our access, we did reduce it down to one drive lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| That would be essentially close to the westernmost driveway for the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5769)|
| 1:36:15| Parking and traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| With the planned residential zoning that was intentionally selected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5777)|
| 1:36:22| there's a use-on-review process that's involved with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| Our designer has already submitted an application with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| Inclusive of that is a traffic impact study, stormwater and drainage design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5789)|
| 1:36:34| elevations, site plan, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| We do believe it gives some more control over how this is designed by a planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| especially to be able to address some of these transitional concerns by the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| The density was really more pragmatic for matching to the adjacent city parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5808)|
| 1:36:54| We do anticipate annexing them all together into the city the next cycle, next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| But I'll defer my time for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| I believe there's some others who would like to speak in support of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| Gene Burr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5828)|
| 1:37:19| Mr. Burr, could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5839)|
| 1:37:27| Gene Burr, 3621 Maloney Road, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5847)|
| 1:37:34| I'd just like to briefly address the commission in support of the application, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5854)|
| 1:37:41| I've been part of the community effort to be involved in positive change on Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5861)|
| 1:37:52| after suffering through many years of depreciated commercial activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5872)|
| 1:38:03| to where we've lost three service stations, grocery stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5883)|
| 1:38:10| You almost have to have lived through it to understand and appreciate where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5890)|
| 1:38:18| We're at the point where the construction is about to be completed to make a safer highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5898)|
| 1:38:24| but it's coming at a high price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| Those businesses that were just barely hanging on by a thread before construction started two or three years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5906)|
| 1:38:34| have now left, even National Fitness that kind of hung on for a long time has pulled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5914)|
| 1:38:45| So the issue here for us, members of the commission, is much broader than this specific rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5925)|
| 1:38:55| We support the rezoning without reservation because we feel like it is critical and key| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5935)|
| 1:39:01| to the redevelopment of that commercial corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| The developers that worked with us on the design charrette two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5945)|
| 1:39:11| which we sponsored at the urging of the planning director at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5951)|
| 1:39:16| because he felt it would expedite, facilitate revision of the small area plan for the commercial corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5956)|
| 1:39:27| and the developers that we engaged with said without reservation that you've got to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5967)|
| 1:39:35| more residential development to support the kind of businesses that you're trying to attract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5975)|
| 1:39:41| We monitored with KGIS the activities on the corridor starting almost a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5981)|
| 1:39:52| This property was the first one to emerge as being advertised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5992)|
| 1:39:58| and we were apprehensive that that property would develop in the absence of an updated plan for the commercial corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=5998)|
| 1:40:05| Your staff is now involved in the restudy of this commercial corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| and it will come back before you after the staff completes its assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6010)|
| 1:40:16| But we feel like the developers that we consulted with knew what they were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6016)|
| 1:40:21| They came to us through the East Tennessee Community Design Center, which worked with us on the charrette,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6021)|
| 1:40:28| to try to get a handle on this with the best advice available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| So I have to urge you to support this application as we hope the first positive step toward a redeveloped commercial corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6032)|
| 1:40:46| that is going to have an uphill climb in any case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6046)|
| 1:40:53| Excuse me, Mr. Burr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| If I could ask commission, any opposition to two more minutes for both parties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6055)|
| 1:41:01| So, I mean, watch the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| Mr. Burr, there's one more person that would like to speak following you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| so we'll grant two more minutes for both the applicant and the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6067)|
| 1:41:15| I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| We're going to give an extra two minutes to both the applicant as well as the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6077)|
| 1:41:23| But remember that there is somebody else who would like to speak after you, so be cautious of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6083)|
| 1:41:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| Appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6090)|
| 1:41:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| Ms. Proctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6095)|
| 1:41:49| I'm Kathy Proctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| I live at 2429 Lakemore Drive in Lakemore Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| which is a subdivision across the highway from this planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6115)|
| 1:42:00| I spoke to this group before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| I told you I represented the Alcoa Highway Beautification Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6122)|
| 1:42:07| and that's a group that was made up of people who live on both sides of the highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| and were focused on working with TDOT, working with the city of Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6132)|
| 1:42:20| in order to ensure that what was finished at the end of the reconstruction and redevelopment of Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6140)|
| 1:42:27| is an asset to everyone in neighborhoods on both sides of the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| And previously, I remember the staff member, Liz, spoke to us at a sector presentation about five years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6152)|
| 1:42:46| and said that if we did not get more residents in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| there would be no way to support the services that we desperately needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| And, of course, we watched that for five years, and she was absolutely right about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6175)|
| 1:43:01| And we think that the apartment complex that Dominion is proposing is exactly what we need to begin to get our numbers up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6181)|
| 1:43:11| And we believe that traffic generated by the complex will not impact the area very significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6191)|
| 1:43:19| because it's right adjacent to the main traffic corridor, Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6199)|
| 1:43:24| Also, as part of the Alcoa Highway Beautification Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6204)|
| 1:43:30| we worked with TDOT to make sure that they were going to address some type of landscaping to repair what had been destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6210)|
| 1:43:42| And we have a commitment from the city to fund that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| It's planned to be implemented within about a month or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6226)|
| 1:43:53| And we expressed to Dominion how important the landscape development was to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6233)|
| 1:43:59| and they have subsequently brought that same landscape architect on their staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6239)|
| 1:44:04| to make sure that the development that they're doing around their complex complements what we're doing right there at Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6244)|
| 1:44:13| So we thought that was a very positive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| One other thing, when they had the first speak-up meeting at Mount Olive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6256)|
| 1:44:20| Knox County school member Christy Christie assured us that the Knox County schools had sufficient capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6260)|
| 1:44:30| to take any of the new children that would be living in this complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6270)|
| 1:44:35| and that wouldn't be a burden on the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| So we thought that was pretty wonderful also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| But lastly, I'd say in my own subdivision in Lakemore Hills, we've had two multifamily projects come to different densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6282)|
| 1:44:53| One was a planned unit development, and one was a condo project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| both of which were met with pretty severe resistance at the time because we knew it was going to ruin our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6297)|
| 1:45:04| And as a result, though, we've seen that as a result of that, there hasn't been a traffic impact that we thought it was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6304)|
| 1:45:15| Ms. Proctor, excuse me, you need to wrap up your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| I think you're well over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| And property devaluations that we anticipated occurring didn't occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6320)|
| 1:45:25| and even some residents were able to benefit from city services that they had never had access to before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6325)|
| 1:45:32| So we support the development, and we think it is a welcome addition to this part of south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6332)|
| 1:45:40| Thank you, Ms. Proctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6340)|
| 1:45:41| Opposition, you have additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6341)|
| 1:45:45| Try to be brief if you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| Thank you, and I'll try to be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6347)|
| 1:45:48| Do I need to say my name and address again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| Massingill 3116 Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6351)|
| 1:45:55| With all due respect to Mr. Burr and the lady who just spoke, we're not against landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6355)|
| 1:46:01| In fact, we're not against development in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| We would like to point out, though, that Maloney Road is divided by Alcoy Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| and the support that you are hearing from anyone with a Maloney Road address is from the Lakemoor Hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6369)|
| 1:46:16| These people are not impacted by Omega Church's traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6376)|
| 1:46:20| They do not drive the stretch of Maloney Road that we drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| They do not deal with the same roundabout that we deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6383)|
| 1:46:27| So please take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| On your plan amendment and rezoning report, I'd like to point out two flaws of logic that you may want to correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6389)|
| 1:46:37| On page 14-2, under trends and development, and on page 14-3, top paragraph .5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6397)|
| 1:46:46| your staff has noted that, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| vacancy rates for commercial and office uses have also decreased within the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6408)|
| 1:46:57| Logically, I think what they're trying to say is that occupancy rates have decreased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6417)|
| 1:47:03| Vacancy rates have increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| This is a technical hail Mary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| but I would respectfully request that a member of your body introduce a motion to postpone the vote on the agenda items today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6430)|
| 1:47:18| that you recheck your notification mailings, because in addition to mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6438)|
| 1:47:24| someone who lives directly next to the easternmost property but behind it was not notified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6444)|
| 1:47:32| and we didn't know that until Sunday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| to ensure that all those whose properties adjoin and are within the limit are notified of your next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6456)|
| 1:47:44| and that your staff has an opportunity to correct a logic flaw in your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6464)|
| 1:47:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6470)|
| 1:47:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| Chair will recognize Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6474)|
| 1:47:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6479)|
| 1:48:00| I have driven this road several times, specifically over the last couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6480)|
| 1:48:06| I'm familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| I've been hit by walnuts on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6488)|
| 1:48:11| There's my proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| But my concern with this, because I voted in favor of the Dominion groups development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6493)|
| 1:48:21| I do believe that it is a good and sound transition from a very busy Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6501)|
| 1:48:28| However, I can't remember who said this, but in one of the community comments, there was a question about where does it stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6508)|
| 1:48:35| Because here is an additional component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| And I had that same question because, you know, it's a transition, and then the transition can continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6518)|
| 1:48:46| It's no longer a transition, and we're losing a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| So my question is to, I think, the developer about the two properties that are in question today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6529)|
| 1:48:58| Those currently have two historic homes on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| As far as historic, I mean, they're older homes that are vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| They may not be on the register, but, yes, they're older homes that were part of that original neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| So those are going to be going away if this passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6552)|
| 1:49:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| Yeah, I believe one was built in the 70s and one of them in the 50s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| Those also have, at least one of them, has a good bit of larger tree canopy or older trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6560)|
| 1:49:29| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| Yes, there's a separate parcel that's in the kind of northeast corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| And that's the section that we've intentionally shifted our plan away from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6576)|
| 1:49:41| I'm looking at the document that you handed out and seeing how on that document it's saying that there's a pool that abuts where this would end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6581)|
| 1:49:53| And there's a property right next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| That is water retention for stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6596)|
| 1:49:58| Water retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6598)|
| 1:49:59| Okay, not a pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6599)|
| 1:50:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6600)|
| 1:50:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| You also indicated in your statement that you're very concerned about treating that buffer with care and that you have already begun working on some type of plan to make sure that that is handled with care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6603)|
| 1:50:21| That's my biggest concern with this project, is that there is a successful transition from this new design to an existing neighborhood, that it is one of those historic neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6621)|
| 1:50:34| Agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6634)|
| 1:50:35| And that's why I believe the use-on-review process is helpful here, because then the things that we've been saying we will do will actually come up for review with the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6635)|
| 1:50:45| So as far as that buffer, we've set back buildings and tried to preserve more trees along basically the borders with the single-family homes that remain and with our community, so they come further back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6645)|
| 1:50:56| Additionally, the stormwater retention would be there as well, so there's no structure there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6656)|
| 1:51:00| It's basically green space that's kind of raised up to contain water during storm events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6660)|
| 1:51:05| But that all would be a part of our use-on-review plan that we would be committed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| I believe with the planned residential, basically any use has to come before MPC, so we would be required to follow that plan that was approved on use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6670)|
| 1:51:22| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6684)|
| 1:51:28| Chair, we'll entertain a motion to approve the South County Sector Plan Amendment to MDRO, Medium Density Residential Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6688)|
| 1:51:36| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6698)|
| 1:51:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6699)|
| 1:51:46| Chair will recognize Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6706)|
| 1:51:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| We're voting on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6712)|
| 1:51:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| And to do that, the sector plan has to meet certain requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6716)|
| 1:52:04| And I'm reading from the staff recommendation is to approve South County Sector Plan Amendment to Medium Density Residential Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6724)|
| 1:52:18| And classification, use classification, because it provides a transitional land use between the highway corridor and the adjacent single-family residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6738)|
| 1:52:36| That is exactly the same language that was used in the July meeting to approve the track in the city, was to provide a transition from the highway to the low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6756)|
| 1:52:59| Now what we're doing, we're going to take the low-density residential that it was supposed to provide the transition to and make it medium-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6779)|
| 1:53:16| so that technically they could put another 99 apartments in there, and that's going to help protect the low-density residential on their other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6796)|
| 1:53:31| So somehow that doesn't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6811)|
| 1:53:38| I guess I'd like somebody to explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| The other thing, before you go on, I'll probably forget this, but Gene Burr that spoke here, I've known him for 45 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6821)|
| 1:53:51| And going back 40 to 45 years in Lakemore Hills, we had a group called MASH, the old TV show, and it meant Make Alcoa Highway a Safe Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6831)|
| 1:54:07| M-A-S-H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| Make Alcoa a Safe Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| That's how long he's been working on this, and Alcoa Highway has finally come around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6851)|
| 1:54:19| It will be a safe highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| Apartments are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| That's not the point, but I wanted to thank him for, he's been a driving force, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6863)|
| 1:54:32| But anyway, back to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6872)|
| 1:54:36| What are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| We're taking the property that we were supposed to protect by the transition, and are we saying it wasn't enough of a transition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6878)|
| 1:54:50| Or what are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| It was supposed to go to the low-density, and it did, and now we're taking the low-density and making it medium-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6893)|
| 1:55:03| Chairman Phillips, could I speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6903)|
| 1:55:06| First of all, I guess, Commissioner Graff, would you like Ms. Albertson to respond to your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6906)|
| 1:55:13| Somebody, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6913)|
| 1:55:15| First, Liz, do you mind commenting on Commissioner Graff's comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6915)|
| 1:55:21| And then if the applicant would like to make a comment, that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6921)|
| 1:55:24| Yes, I will just generally say that the medium-density residential slash office land use designation is considered a transitional zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6924)|
| 1:55:34| So I see what you're saying about it continuing to grow, but, you know, medium-density residential uses adjacent to low-density residential are typical in areas specifically next to large infrastructure improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6934)|
| 1:55:54| Mr. Albertson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| I was just going to speak to our initial intent was to include all of these in one application, and there were some delays in securing the county parcels, which resulted in this being a delayed hearing on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6956)|
| 1:56:09| So I think there's maybe a sense that we're adding to what was previously requested, but initially our concept has not changed from as far as the boundary that we were inclusive there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6969)|
| 1:56:19| So I just wanted to mention that our goal was to initially do this all at once, but it was just a procedural delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6979)|
| 1:56:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6985)|
| 1:56:28| Mr. Chairman, the basis of my motion was based on what staff has written in the changes and conditions warranting that change, in that the improvements to Alcoa Highway, it is a safer place now, and it makes sense, I think, in my mind for this development to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=6988)|
| 1:56:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| Commissioner Scott Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| Yeah, I was just along the lines of justification for sector plans. It was mentioned that Lonas Road, I didn't see what I see here, and so I'm going to support this because of the changes in the intersection, traffic improvements, the overall change of conditions at this intersection, which I want to explain when the Lonas Road, I did not see those changes. That's what I was questioning on the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7011)|
| 1:57:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| So we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| One more quick question. You just stated that this was a part of your plan all along, and did you meet with the homeowners out there and talk to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7040)|
| 1:57:32| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| And you showed them where your project boundary would be ultimately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| They all opposed it, too, except for the two that spoke here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7059)|
| 1:57:45| Yeah, I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| 30 or 40 people later opposed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| I just want to make sure that he was clear with the residents that this was not an add-on, that this was something that you were trying to do, and this is the boundary that you were trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7071)|
| 1:57:57| That's correct. I just realized it was probably a natural misunderstanding because there's a second application, but from that initial meeting, we've actually reduced the number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7077)|
| 1:58:07| We increased the setback on that side in response to those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7087)|
| 1:58:12| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7094)|
| 1:58:17| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| I was just going to say, I seem to remember this being in the scope of the discussion back in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7099)|
| 1:58:25| So this is no surprise to me, and it seems like deja vu, like we've had this exact conversation already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7105)|
| 1:58:33| So I, again, second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| We have a motion by Commissioner Ross, seconded by Commissioner Higgins to approve the South County Sector Plan Amendment to MDRO, Medium Density Residential Office, per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7116)|
| 1:58:48| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7132)|
| 1:58:54| One, two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| Okay, so Commissioner Graf and Commissioner Boyer are no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7136)|
| 1:59:01| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| Chair, I want to entertain a motion to approve PR Plan Residential Zoning up to 21 dwelling units per acre, per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=7143)|

| 2:17:17| Opposition, if you'd come up and give us your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8237)|

| 2:19:35| to agree with the staff recommendation to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8375)|
| 2:19:38| Delrose Drive is a busy, overwhelmed, thorough way for many commuters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8378)|

| 2:19:52| would ruin the appeal of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8392)|
| 2:19:54| and the charismatics of R1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8394)|

| 2:20:00| Per the plan amendment report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8400)|
| 2:20:01| the applicant suggests the possibility of 268 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8401)|
| 2:20:05| but the area, if rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8405)|
| 2:20:07| may have the potential for up to 487 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8407)|
| 2:20:10| by new dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8410)|
| 2:20:15| The community worries that the intent to rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| the specific parcel to a much higher density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| would impede traffic safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| create a disturbance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8421)|
| 2:20:22| and overwhelm an already outdated road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8422)|
| 2:20:25| with no sidewalks or shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| With being void of many amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| the new population of so many residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| would be greatly underserved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8431)|
| 2:20:32| and not have access to essential resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8432)|
| 2:20:35| Along with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8435)|
| 2:20:36| public transportation would be a dangerous walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8436)|
| 2:20:41| to an area across the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| that is not serviced by transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8443)|
| 2:20:47| Children of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8447)|
| 2:20:48| would also be underserved in educational resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| The neighborhood school also has the challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8451)|
| 2:20:53| of being overcrowded as it stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| Such development and growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| would warrant new schools to be built in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8457)|
| 2:21:00| Children would have to walk to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8460)|
| 2:21:02| if not car drivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8462)|
| 2:21:03| because they are not serviced by school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8463)|
| 2:21:06| The primary route is via Riverside Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| The road has a very steep portion limiting sight distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8468)|
| 2:21:11| and is too narrow to have a center stripe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8471)|
| 2:21:14| The easement would be located on parcel ID 083-PB-006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8474)|
| 2:21:19| or the Marble Hill entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| And continuing on a long drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| that all sits on the HP overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8483)|
| 2:21:26| Our fear is that hardscaping this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8486)|
| 2:21:28| would cause massive issues in water management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8488)|
| 2:21:30| and irrigations to the residents of Marble Hill and below,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8490)|
| 2:21:34| which there is already a current issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8494)|
| 2:21:38| The Marble Hill condos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8498)|
| 2:21:39| which were an utter failure, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8499)|
| 2:21:42| in many residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8502)|
| 2:21:43| and still very dilapidated and even empty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| was annexed in before HP overlay was implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8506)|
| 2:21:49| And we ask that you honor the hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8509)|
| 2:21:52| for the very reasons it was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8512)|
| 2:21:55| On behalf of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8515)|
| 2:21:56| please acknowledge public comments on OX planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8516)|
| 2:21:59| Town Hall East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8519)|
| 2:22:00| and the 47 signatures in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8520)|
| 2:22:04| We hope the board recognizes the significance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8524)|
| 2:22:06| of the current zoning and the great detriment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| an amendment would have to our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8528)|
| 2:22:10| We appreciate your recommendation for denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8530)|
| 2:22:13| Thank you, Ms. Winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8533)|
| 2:22:14| Applicant, your name and address, please, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8534)|
| 2:22:19| Kanika White, 2439 East 5th Avenue, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8539)|
| 2:22:25| Okay, so we are seeking medium density zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8545)|
| 2:22:28| to build approximately 100 to 200 apartment units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8548)|
| 2:22:32| The area is currently mixed with R and 1, R and 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8552)|
| 2:22:35| and industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| The units will be moderate income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8557)|
| 2:22:39| affordable rental housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8559)|
| 2:22:41| and we can even look at some other uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8561)|
| 2:22:45| other than doing maybe 50 unit structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8565)|
| 2:22:49| We can do duplexes or quadplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8569)|
| 2:22:51| to fit more with the character of the community as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8571)|
| 2:22:54| and to also switch community concerns from the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8574)|
| 2:22:59| And truthfully, there just isn't enough land in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8579)|
| 2:23:05| so for developments like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8585)|
| 2:23:07| in order to provide housing, land is scarce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8587)|
| 2:23:10| In order to do housing, you have to build somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8590)|
| 2:23:13| and as it currently stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8593)|
| 2:23:16| it's just not, again, a lot of land in the city for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8596)|
| 2:23:20| And right now, in regards to traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8600)|
| 2:23:23| we have a lot of workers coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8603)|
| 2:23:26| from outside of the city to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8606)|
| 2:23:28| and so those workers are putting wear and tear on the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8608)|
| 2:23:31| that people who live in the city have to pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8611)|
| 2:23:34| So I also think that that is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8614)|
| 2:23:35| that should be considered and taken into account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8615)|
| 2:23:38| and we are asking that you approve our request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8618)|
| 2:23:41| for the rezoning and the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8621)|
| 2:23:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8623)|
| 2:23:46| Chair will recognize Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8626)|
| 2:23:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8630)|
| 2:23:51| I think the applicant makes some valid points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8631)|
| 2:23:54| However, I just don't think this is the appropriate place for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8634)|
| 2:23:57| and I'm going to move that we deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8637)|
| 2:23:59| the City Sector Plan Amendment to the MDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8639)|
| 2:24:02| Land Use Classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8642)|

| 2:26:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8805)|
| 2:26:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8808)|
| 2:26:52| I really just want to address the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8812)|
| 2:26:54| the sector plans are fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8814)|

| 2:26:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8819)|
| 2:27:00| Opposition, would you like to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8820)|
| 2:27:02| and state your name and address for the record, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8822)|
| 2:27:19| My name is Scotty Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8839)|
| 2:27:20| I live at 7017 Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8840)|
| 2:27:25| Eight and a half of those acres I own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8845)|
| 2:27:28| and there's probably maybe six people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8848)|
| 2:27:33| that acquire the rest of the land there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8853)|
| 2:27:37| The highway is a very well-used highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8857)|
| 2:27:42| There's probably two and a half to three hours of the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8862)|
| 2:27:46| and two and a half to three hours of the evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8866)|
| 2:27:48| where you're going to be setting from red light to red light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8868)|
| 2:27:52| and that's from Shod Road to Grace Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8872)|
| 2:27:56| If we put any more businesses in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8876)|
| 2:27:58| where there is just five or six residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8878)|
| 2:28:01| trying to get in and out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8881)|
| 2:28:02| if there were businesses in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8882)|
| 2:28:05| you would hardly ever be able to get in and out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8885)|
| 2:28:08| and it's also a ridge line that runs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8888)|
| 2:28:10| between Ball Road and Oak Ridge Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8890)|
| 2:28:13| paralleled with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8893)|
| 2:28:14| which has quite a bit of animal life on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8894)|
| 2:28:17| A lot of deer, coyotes, foxes, bobcats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8897)|
| 2:28:22| and the rest of this end of our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8902)|
| 2:28:25| has been built up so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8905)|
| 2:28:26| there's very little bit of room left for animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8906)|
| 2:28:29| and I personally just like living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8909)|
| 2:28:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8912)|
| 2:28:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8913)|
| 2:28:36| Mr. Graham?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8916)|
| 2:28:44| Please go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8924)|
| 2:28:49| Mr. Graham, name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8929)|
| 2:28:52| and you have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8932)|
| 2:28:54| Tim Graham, 7010 Oak Ridge Highway, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8934)|
| 2:28:59| I lived on this, I'm not sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8939)|
| 2:29:03| I think Scotty may live across the street from 7017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8943)|
| 2:29:08| 7017, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8950)|
| 2:29:13| I've lived here 35 years, drive through my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8953)|
| 2:29:18| through this proposed rezoning every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8958)|
| 2:29:21| 1,500 feet, I live in the back behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8961)|
| 2:29:27| I've been, we rezoned it back in the 80s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8967)|
| 2:29:32| to a planned commercial, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8972)|
| 2:29:34| the original track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8974)|
| 2:29:36| Since that time I've purchased some of my neighbor's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8976)|
| 2:29:40| which is what we're adding to the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8980)|
| 2:29:43| about 10 or 12 acres, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8983)|
| 2:29:46| But we've developed property in Knox County for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8986)|
| 2:29:53| In addition, we've developed some shopping centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8993)|
| 2:29:58| of good quality like Fountain Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=8998)|
| 2:30:03| which MPC gave us a nice award for, design award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9003)|
| 2:30:07| which we kind of built similar to Franklin Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9007)|
| 2:30:13| on a smaller scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9013)|
| 2:30:16| I would say that also I believe Franklin Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9016)|
| 2:30:21| was developed with the CA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9021)|
| 2:30:24| The uniqueness of our property is the frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9024)|
| 2:30:27| which gives us an opportunity to do a really nice development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9027)|
| 2:30:31| with controlled access and spacing of your buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9031)|
| 2:30:35| landscaping, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9035)|
| 2:30:37| It does back up to a floodway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9037)|
| 2:30:39| which across the floodway is where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9039)|
| 2:30:41| So it's doubtful that I'm going to do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9041)|
| 2:30:44| anyone that's familiar with some of our developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9044)|
| 2:30:46| that we're going to do anything in front of my house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9046)|
| 2:30:49| that would not be of the first quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9049)|
| 2:30:54| Our biggest thing that we're requesting is the CA zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9054)|
| 2:30:58| because we've, 30 years ago, I think, planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9058)|
| 2:31:03| was kind of the thing to do, but with so much oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9063)|
| 2:31:08| over my 40 years of development, so much oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9068)|
| 2:31:12| whether it's permitting, TDAC, TDOT, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9072)|
| 2:31:16| we just don't feel like we need the plan zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9076)|
| 2:31:19| for our own property right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9079)|
| 2:31:25| And, of course, as Amy and I, I think, discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9085)|
| 2:31:30| you get one plan approved and you change something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9090)|
| 2:31:33| you're going to have to do another plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9093)|
| 2:31:35| And so we don't see this as being a massive development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9095)|
| 2:31:41| all at once, that it'll be an acre, two acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9101)|
| 2:31:45| three acres at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9105)|
| 2:31:48| but it will be very strategic, very selective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9108)|
| 2:31:53| and, again, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9113)|
| 2:31:55| we'll be able to provide the good access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9115)|
| 2:31:58| It's a great straightaway through there for our sight lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9118)|
| 2:32:01| and I think that we can address all those issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9121)|
| 2:32:05| and Knox County obviously will, too, and TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9125)|
| 2:32:09| And, lastly, you know, I noticed that a couple properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9129)|
| 2:32:13| on Oak Ridge Highway today will rezone CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9133)|
| 2:32:16| I passed a map out that shows, basically, the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9136)|
| 2:32:20| from the, I call it the corn's red light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9140)|
| 2:32:23| down to the new food city at Chaud Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9143)|
| 2:32:25| You can see all the red on it, even CB zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9145)|
| 2:32:30| And I think our track record speaks for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9150)|
| 2:32:35| I think we deserve to be trusted with a CA zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9155)|
| 2:32:38| on our own property that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9158)|
| 2:32:41| I'm going to drive through at least another 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9161)|
| 2:32:44| I hope I live to 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9164)|
| 2:32:46| It's really kind of hard to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9166)|
| 2:32:48| Other than John King, I think I'm the oldest guy in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9168)|
| 2:32:53| But coming down here all these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9173)|
| 2:32:57| But I think the map is indicative, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9177)|
| 2:33:00| corn's is growing and some good development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9180)|
| 2:33:04| I think Mr. Hill even owns a piece of property up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9184)|
| 2:33:06| that's a nice retail development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9186)|
| 2:33:09| If we can build something as nice as him, I'm sure we'll do fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9189)|
| 2:33:14| So I'm fine with the staff on the plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9194)|
| 2:33:21| I think that was a little mistake there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9201)|
| 2:33:23| But we respectfully request CA zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9203)|
| 2:33:27| just like all our neighbors out there have up and down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9207)|
| 2:33:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9212)|
| 2:33:35| Seeing no other comments, I'll open up commission comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9215)|
| 2:33:40| I'd like to, Mr. Hill, I'd like to hear from staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9220)|
| 2:33:44| just a little more narrative on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9224)|
| 2:33:46| as to why we didn't consider CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9226)|
| 2:33:50| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9230)|
| 2:33:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9235)|
| 2:33:56| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9236)|
| 2:33:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9237)|
| 2:33:58| So when we were updating the Northwest County sector plan in 2015, 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9238)|
| 2:34:04| one of the things that was expressed by the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9244)|
| 2:34:07| was the concern for commercial creep down the entirety of Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9247)|
| 2:34:13| The CA zone district does not have very extensive standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9253)|
| 2:34:19| when it comes to setbacks or landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9259)|
| 2:34:24| It is typical of what you would see with strip commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9264)|
| 2:34:28| It's usually developed often under CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9268)|
| 2:34:32| Staff felt that because we also have a need for residential in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9272)|
| 2:34:38| that a better recommendation for this area would be to put it back in a mixed-use district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9278)|
| 2:34:46| like it had previously been in the last sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9286)|
| 2:34:50| And mixed-use community commercial allows residential in this area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9290)|
| 2:34:56| The planned commercial zone district requires a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9296)|
| 2:35:01| basically for all new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9301)|
| 2:35:03| So a plan would be submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9303)|
| 2:35:05| It would give us an opportunity to sort of think about the phasing of this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9305)|
| 2:35:11| and how it all fits together rather than piecemeal under the CA zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9311)|
| 2:35:17| When you talk about commercial creep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9317)|
| 2:35:19| tell me specifically where it's creeping because it looks like it's already crept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9319)|
| 2:35:24| Well, so if you look at the existing land use versus the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9324)|
| 2:35:28| there's a lot of that CA zoning that's actually out there that isn't developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9328)|
| 2:35:33| So it's been there for quite a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9333)|
| 2:35:35| It hasn't developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9335)|
| 2:35:36| I think that bend that you see along Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9336)|
| 2:35:40| We have a lot of commercial zoning around the county that hasn't been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9340)|
| 2:35:45| So, I mean, typically, you know, if you have existing zoning that's out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9345)|
| 2:35:52| it seems like it would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9352)|
| 2:35:54| be a little bit more logical to build commercial uses where the zoning already exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9354)|
| 2:36:00| because eventually it's going to connect perhaps all the way down the corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9360)|
| 2:36:04| if it's just CA through the entirety of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9364)|
| 2:36:09| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9369)|
| 2:36:12| Yeah, I was just going to ask about, I think item 12 was Grassy Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9372)|
| 2:36:17| which is right up the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9377)|
| 2:36:18| It's on this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9378)|
| 2:36:19| And I think we just rezoned it to CA on staff recommendation earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9379)|
| 2:36:24| didn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9384)|
| 2:36:25| I mean, and I just wondered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9385)|
| 2:36:30| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9390)|
| 2:36:31| Am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9391)|
| 2:36:32| Yeah, I would say that this, that is not, that's not a node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9392)|
| 2:36:35| That's a more of a node situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9395)|
| 2:36:38| It's not really, you know, parallel to the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9398)|
| 2:36:43| So, I feel like in that case, it's a little different of a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9403)|
| 2:36:49| The nice thing about the planned commercial zone district is that it's typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9409)|
| 2:36:55| designed for larger properties that are 20 acres in size or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9415)|
| 2:37:00| And I believe this property is 29 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9420)|
| 2:37:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9424)|
| 2:37:06| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9426)|
| 2:37:10| Yeah, the comment was made that there's unused commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9430)|
| 2:37:15| up and down the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9435)|
| 2:37:17| The only problem with that is the applicant doesn't own that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211014?start=9437)|
