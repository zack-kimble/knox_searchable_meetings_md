| 0:02:43| Okay, we're down to the mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=163)|
| 0:02:45| First, I'll start by telling you that Bob Polk from Public Assemblies asked that I report that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=165)|
| 0:02:52| Knoxville Ice Bears will play the Pensacola Ice Flyers at 7.30 p.m. Thursday, April 5th, at the Knoxville Civic Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=172)|
| 0:03:00| This will be round one in a best-of-three matchup between the Ice Bears and the Ice Flyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=180)|
| 0:03:06| And also, Knoxville's professional indoor football team, the Nighthawks, have kicked off their inaugural season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=186)|
| 0:03:13| Their next home game will be played at 7 p.m. on Saturday, April 14th, against the Albany Panthers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=193)|
| 0:03:21| This is also at the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| So thanks to Bob, he's trying to get more people there to enjoy our local sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| And also, I'd like to report that Mayor Burchett from Knox County, Senator Corker, and I are hosting a rally point event tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=208)|
| 0:03:39| This is an event for veterans to get information about the services that are available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=219)|
| 0:03:45| There's a broad range of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| About 40 or so agencies will be at the Jacob Building tomorrow from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=227)|
| 0:03:55| So any veterans and family members are invited to come to speak with these different agencies for different kinds of assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=235)|
| 0:04:03| It might be medical benefits, housing, educational assistance, jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=243)|
| 0:04:11| There's a big range of services that they are offering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| Again, that is tomorrow at the Jacob Building at Chilhowee Park from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=254)|
| 0:04:23| Are you talking about the South Knoxville meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| Well, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| I'm going to announce we're having a public meeting to discuss a proposed residential waterfront development within the South Knoxville Riverfront District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=268)|
| 0:04:42| Waterfront District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| It is tomorrow, April 4th, at 6.30 p.m. at the South Knoxville Elementary School on Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=283)|
| 0:04:53| This is a public meeting about the proposed 220-unit apartment complex right next to the entrance to Island Home on the eastern end of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=293)|
| 0:05:05| South Waterfront District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| So the public is invited there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| The developer of the proposed project will be there to answer questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| and city staff will be there to hear comments and to answer questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| And we will have our first Mayor's Night Out in the Mechanicsville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| All three of the neighborhood organizations in Mechanicsville are invited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| and we will be addressing issues related to Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| This will be on Tuesday, April 10th, a week from tonight, at 7 p.m. at the Clinton Chapel AME Zion Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=337)|
| 0:05:47| which is at 546 College Street in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| And so we certainly invite folks to come out for that, particularly those that live in Mechanicsville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| and we'll have many of our department heads and staff will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| And finally, I do want to welcome, I understand we have Troop 140,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| the Boy Scouts Troop 140 here from West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| Would you please stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| We'd like to welcome you and thank you for coming here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=369)|
| 0:06:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| So now to reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| I'd just like to inform everyone in this room Monday, beginning at 7 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| we're going to have a workshop on the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| We normally start at 5, but this is just an unusual circumstance that we will be beginning at 7 o'clock instead of 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=391)|
| 0:06:40| So that's this coming up Monday evening in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| And I wanted to comment, too, on the mayor and Councilman Starr were at a kickoff breakfast, if you will, Saturday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=403)|
| 0:06:53| I don't know the exact name of the group, but I think it was Southern Appalachian Outdoor Bike something, something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| Appalachian Mountain Biking Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| Yeah, those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| But the importance of that is I'm going to talk about bike trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| And I know y'all, that shocks people, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| But they came in, and I was talking with Ken Knight from the Crown Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| They had about 50 rooms for two nights here, spending money, enjoying the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=433)|
| 0:07:19| And, you know, again, I'm always talking about the trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| But, you know, that's just a great example right there of the economic development force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| that these trails are going to bring to the city, not only now but, you know, way out into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| And they were just so impressed with what we've been able to do here from a public-private perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| And particularly impressive was the amount of the lack of public dollars that have gone into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| and so much so that they've invited Carol Evans, and I'm going to fly her to their national event, I think it's this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=465)|
| 0:07:52| and let her expand on, you know, what they've done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| So, I mean, it's a real tribute to a lot of people that are involved in these trails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| and I just, you know, I'm going to keep talking about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| And they met at the outdoor Knoxville Adventure Center, which you all approved for us to establish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=483)|
| 0:08:10| I think that was the first formal gathering at the Adventure Center down at the old Gateway Pavilion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| So it was a great location for them, very appropriate for what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Yes, I wanted to remind everybody about the Dogwood Arts Festival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| and to watch for several events that are already taking place throughout the city and our Dogwood trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=508)|
| 0:08:37| And I also wanted to mention that Nikki Giovanni, the great poet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| who the mayor mentioned in her inaugural address, will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| She's a Knoxville native.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| And so I hope that we will be mindful of these activities with the Dogwood Arts Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| I just want to footnote what Dan said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| You better get out and look at those dogwoods now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| Those trees are blooming, and they're just about at their peak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| They've beat the dogwood trail season by several weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| And it's really beautiful, but we need to get out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=557)|

| 0:10:54| We do have a speaker, someone who signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| Let me find it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| Richard Laverdure, would you like to address council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| Laverdure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| Please state your name and your address, and you have five minutes, up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| My name is Richard Laverdure, and my address is 10201 Greenspring Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=676)|
| 0:11:24| I'm here because I'm a little concerned about the definition of blight, blighted property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=684)|
| 0:11:36| and who decides what blighted property is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| and how do the homeowners know that their property is blighted so that they can cause repair so that it's unblighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=701)|
| 0:11:50| And that's what I would like to have questioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| I'd like to have that answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| Council, David Brace is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| I think he's our public service director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| He's in charge of Neighborhood Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| Can you want to address that, David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=721)|
| 0:12:11| David Brace, City Public Service, 2150 Maplewood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| So the definition of blight in city code is very clear related to the acquisition of property through the blight ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=735)|
| 0:12:25| the imminent domain process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| It's very clearly defined there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| So it's in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| It's in the city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| The International Property Maintenance Code and the other codes adopted by the city are really the guiding force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| for determining other health and safety issues with private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| with specifically housing property that we deal with mainly in Neighborhood Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| And then how do we notify the owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| City Code is very clear that it states we must do one of the following three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=769)|
| 0:12:55| Post the property, send a letter, or post it in the newspaper of circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| We typically send a letter and post the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| For any property that's going to go before the Better Building Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| we will do a notice, typically in the paper or online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| and send a notice to the folks with an interest in the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| and we will also post the property with those notices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| So there's significant due diligence that goes into trying to notify property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| and folks with an interest in the property, not just the owner but owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| And I don't mind meeting with any citizen or customer if you'd like to talk more in detail about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| Okay, I think that's the only speaker we have signed up for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| So is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=822)|

| 0:13:49| to add a new Article 8 establishing an Office of Administrative Hearing Officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=829)|

| 0:14:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=843)|

| 0:14:05| 9C is an ordinance amending Chapter 6, Article 6, Subsection 6-137, 144, 145, 147, and 148| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=845)|
| 0:14:14| of the Knoxville City Code relating to unfit building complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| modifying the Better Building Board to become an appellate board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| penalties and interest on codes, enforcement liens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| as well as clarifying the appellate process and issuance of emergency orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| We do have a speaker, Kathleen Marquardt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| If you'd like to speak, she signed up opposed to this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| And please give your name and address, and you have up to five minutes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| My name is Kathleen Marquardt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| My address is 1207 Viking Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=884)|
| 0:14:52| The previous gentleman asked about blight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| and I believe that this part of the ordinance is about blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| And I did not understand or hear the definition of what blight is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=900)|
| 0:15:08| but I think it needs to be reasonable and understandable to everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| because this is about private property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| And you have to remember the Constitution holds property rights almost sacrosanct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=918)|
| 0:15:26| and we should, too, hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| Okay, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Yeah, I might add that this particular provision we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| is the one that will set up the office of the administrative hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| that will have actual hearings before any fines or levy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| there will be an opportunity to both be told that your property is in question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| and also to come and to testify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| and present evidence as to why it isn't improperly done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| So there will be that due process recognition in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| These ordinances are here on the second reading in large part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| because the city's been suffering from handfuls of properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| that have basically dragged down neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| and we're trying to find better tools to use to deal with the bad apples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| that are kind of ruining the entire barrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| So these are the exceptional cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| not the ordinary run-of-the-mill property differences you might have with your neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| These are situations where properties are really run down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| They're dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| They're unfit for human habitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| They're causing property values and community cohesion to fail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| and these tools that are being adopted are our way of trying to find a way to solve the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1008)|
| 0:16:57| than we have in the past where they've dragged on for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| So that's my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| I just want to add to that what Councilman Talabope has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| I think one of the things that all of us need to be aware of is that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| there are property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| but there's also property rights of the neighbors next door in each one of these situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| and I think that's one of the things that we're trying to look at as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| I think that's important to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1045)|

| 0:17:30| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| 9D is an ordinance amending Chapter 13, Article 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| subsection 13-147 of the Knoxville City Code relating to penalties and interest on lot liens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1054)|
| 0:17:40| and removing the better building board from the lot lien release process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| 10A is a resolution approving an appeal by Richard Cadmus of the Metropolitan Planning Commission's decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| to approve a USOM review for up to 42 multi-dwelling apartments subject to conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| in an O1 office medical and related service district property located on the northwest side of Sutherland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| southwest side of North Concord Street, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| Since this is an appeal, would you like to hear from one person signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| Mr. Cadmus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| Mr. Cadmus, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| Please come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| And if you would like to speak to council about this item that you appealed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| please state your name and your address, and you have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1112)|
| 0:18:41| My name is Richard Cadmus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| I live at 23 actually I live at 8867 Happy Howell Road in Lenoir City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1122)|
| 0:18:49| and I have a building at 2315 Sutherland Avenue in Knoxville that's on seven commercial lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1129)|
| 0:19:07| First of all, does anybody have any questions about why I'm appealing this MPC ruling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1147)|
| 0:19:15| Typically we just let you have this as an opportunity for you to state your concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| your case for why you would like them to grant your appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| Well, first of all, I'm not a public speaker, and I'm not very good at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1168)|
| 0:19:35| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| We all have been there at some point in our life, so you take your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| Well, there's eight zoning variances that are required to go along with the proposed building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1181)|
| 0:19:48| on the property next to mine on Sutherland Avenue that's basically turned the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1188)|
| 0:19:56| into a high-density residential multi-dwelling apartment building, which is appropriate for R3 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1196)|
| 0:20:05| The building is going in O1 zoning, which has a use on review that we're talking about today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| that was approved by the MPC for an R2 use, which is only good for a medium-density apartment building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1211)|
| 0:20:25| of up to 42 apartments, excuse me, up to 24 apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| The apartment building being proposed is 42 apartments, which would be high-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| The eight variances that will require that it will at least have to have are parking variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1237)|
| 0:20:48| a building setback front yard variance on the A front yard, the building setback on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1248)|
| 0:20:57| which I believe that was from 25 feet down to five feet, and that's along Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| The building setback variance on the B front yard, which is on Concord Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| which went down from 25 feet to 17 and a half feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| The lot coverage variance, which will require about an 85 percent variance on what's allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1273)|
| 0:21:25| for that particular lot in square feet, building as it relates to the size of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1285)|
| 0:21:32| The open space variance, which is about an 1840 percent variance on the open space allowed for R2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1292)|
| 0:21:41| and that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| The building side yard setback variance, and I can't remember what that is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| but there was a variance for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1312)|
| 0:22:00| The utility easement variance along Sutherland Avenue, where the KUB requires a 15-foot utility easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1320)|
| 0:22:10| that you can't build inside, where the building's going to be built inside of the utility easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| so that will require another variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| Actually, it's going to put the building right up against a natural gas pipeline also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1337)|
| 0:22:23| about 270 feet along the side of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1343)|
| 0:22:33| And a parking variance that allows cars to park directly off the alley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| and they'll have to back directly into the alley to leave the parking space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| The parking codes require that there be a curb and open space and that you can't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1364)|
| 0:22:51| you have to enter the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| You can't just back right out into the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| You have to see where you're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| Anyway, all these variances end up having a building that fits the R3 Knoxville Code of Ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1381)|
| 0:23:16| in lot coverage and setback and virtually everything, number of apartments and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1396)|
| 0:23:24| except R3 is not part of the use on review for 01, which is what the property is actually zoned at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1404)|
| 0:23:32| So what this basically is is zoning by variance or I guess the definition would be spot zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1412)|
| 0:23:42| because there's nothing in the one-year plan, the city sector plan, the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1422)|
| 0:23:51| or the Code of Ordinances that really allow for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| Sir, your time is almost up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| And I just ask that you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| Madam Mayor, I've asked that he be given an additional two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| I would just ask that you approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| Just a moment, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| Council, are there any objections to two additional minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| Go ahead, Mr. Cadmus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| I just ask that you approve my appeal of this MPC use on review ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1456)|
| 0:24:24| And that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| Before you leave, Mr. Cadmus, I'd like to ask you a question or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| I read the information that was in the packet about your petition at the BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1473)|
| 0:24:41| and at the MPC and the testimony there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| And one of the concerns I had was I didn't see a real answer to the problem you identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| about this alley, this 10-foot-wide alley that is a place that apparently trucks coming to your business use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1489)|
| 0:24:57| as well as this proposed apartment complex is going to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| and the difficulty that might occur in both sharing it with moving vans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| inability to turn around and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| Could you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| Because to me, I never did see a clear answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| And it may be because we're at a different phase of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| There's not been a plan review by the engineers, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| But that seemed like a real difficulty that this thing was going to create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| Would you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| It's a 10-foot alley that goes from Concord to Portland Street off of Sutherland, parallel to Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1530)|
| 0:25:38| On the Portland side of the alley, it's actually 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| And there's a house and a fence and a drop-off and a yard right at the end of the alley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| and two sidewalks on either side of the alley at 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| A large truck can't come down Portland, turn in the alley and make the corner without tearing down the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1550)|
| 0:25:58| Neither can one come out of the alley and make the corner onto Portland without tearing down the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| It just can't be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| The largest truck you can get down that alley is a 16-foot straight truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| And I know because I have trucks, and I know what fits and what doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| And that's as long a truck as you're going to get down the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| This means that trucks will have to come in from the Concord side of the alley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1577)|
| 0:26:28| and then load or unload and go out the Concord side of the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1588)|
| 0:26:36| The proposed apartment building leaves no space for trucks to unload and unload,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| and it certainly has no space for trucks to turn around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| The way the property, the way the alley works in relation to my property is I can bring trucks and trailers in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1603)|
| 0:26:52| drive up into my property, turn them around, load and unload, and then come back out the alley the same way they came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1612)|
| 0:27:02| The proposed apartment building is not going to have that, not the way it's designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1622)|
| 0:27:11| it's not going to have that ability unless they turn around in my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1631)|
| 0:27:18| And also, they don't have enough parking for their situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| There's really no provisions made to load and unload trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| And you would think that an apartment building with 42 apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| somebody would anticipate trucks coming and going on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1650)|
| 0:27:38| So that's that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| Maybe I could ask Mark Donaldson and or Jim Hagerman if they could address that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| In other words, what do you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| Because that sounded like a real-world problem of a building, a large building on a postage-sized lot of eight-tenths of an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1669)|
| 0:27:57| The alley is the main access, and there's this concern about loading, unloading, and blockage of the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| Plus, it's the only access to my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| Let me ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| I'm asking them at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| I'll take a first shot at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| I'm Jim Hagerman, director of engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| The plan is still under review and under negotiation in engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1695)|
| 0:28:23| The pull-in parking that Mr. Cadmus mentioned is not going to be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| It just takes up too much space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| And backing into the driveway, we agree, is not a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| We are pushing the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| We haven't got commitment yet from the landowner of adding to the alley width at the expense of the proposed development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1717)|
| 0:28:47| so that it's possible to have two-way traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| It's possible to temporarily park a moving van or something like that without blocking the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1731)|
| 0:28:57| They have parking underneath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| It's a little out of my bailiwick to say that there's enough parking, but they do have basement parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1741)|
| 0:29:08| So the parking that they're talking about in the back, I don't know if it's required to meet their total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1748)|
| 0:29:23| So I think we're trying to address some of your problems because we agree that there are problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1763)|
| 0:29:31| And before, there's also a pending traffic study by the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1771)|
| 0:29:40| which will have an influence on some of the final results here, and we haven't got that study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| In short, are you saying that the engineering review process is going to either resolve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| or put the problem back to the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| Is that what's going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| For the issues that you brought up, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| Thank you, Mr. Cadmus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Is there a motion to approve Mr. Cadmus's appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1809)|
| 0:30:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| With no motion, then the appeal dies for lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| 11A is a resolution approving the issuance of a certificate of compliance to Magnolia Package Store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1824)|

| 0:30:37| Is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1840)|

| 0:30:42| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| 11B is a resolution requesting and encouraging appropriate officials at the Tennessee Valley Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| to carefully monitor tree trimming policies designed to cut as few trees as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| and when trimming is required, to trim as little as reasonably feasible in order to maintain power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| I will call them down now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| The first is Larry Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| Also, I have Juanita Braswell and Summer Henry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| They all signed up for this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1876)|
| 0:31:25| Mr. Silverstein, please give your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| My name is Larry Silverstein, 780-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| Sorry, I mispronounced that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Larry Silverstein, 7808 Sheffield Drive, Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| I'm speaking in favor of this Resolution 11B regarding TVA's tree-cutting policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| I'd like to thank Councilman Saunders for originally sponsoring this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| I urge City Council to approve this resolution as a first step in sending TVA a clear message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| that it must immediately reconsider its current policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| which is resulting in the needless removal of tens of thousands of trees just in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| and the surrounding area and other vegetation due to widespread spraying of herbicide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| and there are likely millions of trees throughout TVA's service area that will be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| Cutting down all trees that either are or someday could be 15 feet or taller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| including dogwoods and redbuds, is just not reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| as many of these trees could never be a threat to the very tall transmission lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| and are thus not a threat to safety and reliability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| The trees which are now in jeopardy are mostly on the outer limits of TVA's 150- to 200-foot-wide easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1949)|
| 0:32:36| and have never been cut down until fairly recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| TVA fails to acknowledge that, legally, possessing an easement from the 1930s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| does not give the easement holder unlimited rights to cause unreasonable damage to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| or to interfere unreasonably with its enjoyment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| TVA says trimming trees is too expensive and not an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| Yet these trees do not belong to TVA, the land does not belong to TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| and removing them should only be done as a last resort, not as the only option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| TVA will spend hundreds of millions of dollars on this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| and at the same time claiming it is saving money for the ratepayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| We are here today as the Dogwood Arts Festival is set to begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| to ask you to protect our community from this excessive tree removal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| and to protect these special natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| Knoxville values its trees and canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| Any claim that TVA is being required by the federal government at FERC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| to remove all trees 15 feet or taller is simply false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| FERC's document of frequently asked questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| interestingly titled Tree Trimming and Vegetation Management Landowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| includes question number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| Is it true that electric utilities are required by federal law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| to cut down all the trees near the power lines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| Answer, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| In order to prevent power outages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| federally approved reliability standards require utilities to manage vegetation growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| along the path of their larger power transmission lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| However, federally approved reliability standards do not mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| or prohibit clear-cutting or any other particular method of vegetation management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| Therefore, TVA is free to return to prior, more reasonable policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| that did not require such drastic removal of small trees such as dogwoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| regardless of where they are located in relation to the wires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| TVA has offered other rationale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| such as the outrageous claims of facing huge fines of $1 million a day even for one tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| To date, according to FERC and NERC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| TVA has never once been fined solely for tree-related violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| In fact, since 2006, there have only been 23 fines for a total of $2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| for solely tree-related issues across the entire country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| TVA claims it may be fined an unspecified amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| for an outage that occurred in 2010 in Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| The article in the Sentinel on December 11, 2011 said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| quote, the tree was growing within a foot or so of the line, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| If a tree was that close to the line, it shouldn't have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| and that tree either should have been trimmed if possible and removed if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| But that case is totally different from trees that are far below the lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| or on the outside of the easement and that could never cause a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| So please, don't be fooled by TVA's scary talk of million-dollar fines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| that have never been assessed to TVA or any other utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| solely due to a single tree being allowed to be taller than 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| Large fines by FERC are due to flagrant violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| and usually for violations of several FERC standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| TVA spokespeople and their contractors have constantly told this exaggerated horror story about fines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2128)|
| 0:35:37| to mislead property owners and the public into believing TVA is justified in having such an extreme policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2137)|
| 0:35:44| I hope that City Council, County Commission, and Mayors O'Hara and Burchett will work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| to send a strong message to TVA that they do not approve of this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| County Commission passed its own resolution last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| Congressman Duncan has sent a strong letter to TVA CEO Tom Kilgore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| and Chairman Bill Sansom requesting that TVA carefully consider the current policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| and put forth an honest effort to find some middle ground with homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| The bottom line is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Public and private property should not be destroyed by TVA unless absolutely necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| This, quote, one-size-fits-all, end quote, policy for 16,000 miles of transmission lines must be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2176)|
| 0:36:24| And I thank you very much for your consideration of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Thank you, Mr. Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Ms. Juanita Braswell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| Ma'am, please state your name and address and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| I'm Juanita Davis Braswell at 7116 Wellington Drive, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2198)|
| 0:36:46| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| We are here tonight in regard to TVA tree clearing near transmission lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2208)|
| 0:36:55| Unknown to property owners, TVA also sprays herbicide to kill vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2215)|
| 0:37:04| As a property owner and resident of Dean Hill Community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| I would like to ask City Council to support Resolution 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2229)|
| 0:37:16| To let TVA know their present policy for tree clearing is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| It just isn't right for TVA to come onto private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| to the property owners that TVA will cut down trees 15 feet or taller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2248)|
| 0:37:35| As you know, a 15-foot dogwood tree is not a very big tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| The 60 Leland cypress on Wellington Drive were put there for privacy and provide a sound barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2261)|
| 0:37:51| These trees have never been an issue before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| But TVA is going to cut them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| TVA will not trim trees, just chop them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2277)|
| 0:38:03| This area will definitely be more noisy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| Noisy from the interstate as well as noise from Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2286)|
| 0:38:12| Dollar-wise, it will also cut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Dollar-wise, to cut trees down amounts to a lot of money to rate payers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| and reduces property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| I strongly encourage you to support Resolution 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2307)|
| 0:38:34| Thank you, Ms. Braswell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2314)|

| 0:38:41| Ms. Henry has been delayed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| and I would ask either to allow her to speak at the end of this resolution when the TVA speakers speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| or I do have another speaker who is prepared to speak now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| and we can make Ms. Henry speak at the public forum if she arrives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| I don't know where she is, but I don't know if that's allowed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| Whichever your choice is, to have somebody else now, or we can come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| Without counsel's objection, we can come back after TVA speaks if she arrives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Okay, we have Bert Robinson and Jason Regg from TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| Would you care to address counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2356)|
| 0:39:25| And please state your name and address, and you'll have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| Thank you, Mayor and members of counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| My name is Bert Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| I live at 1716 Stanton Singlite Lane here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| I don't have prepared remarks tonight, but, Mayor, with your permission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| I've got a couple of handouts for counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2383)|
| 0:40:08| Mayor and members, the first handout is a letter that each of you has cc'd on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| It's to the county commission chairman dealing with a resolution that they took up last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| and since you're listed as cc's, we wanted to make sure that you got that copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| Attached to that is a document called Understanding TVA's Vegetation Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| We wanted to make you aware of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| The next document is a series of slides that my colleague, Jason Regg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| is prepared to go through with you this evening very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| I don't have any prepared remarks for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| but we are here to listen to counsel's concerns and to take those back to our management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2440)|
| 0:40:46| and also to answer any questions that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| My name is Jason Regg, 759 Lacey J. Lane, Udawah, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2452)|
| 0:40:59| As he said, I'm here to answer any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| I just wanted to take a quick moment to touch on a few of the reasons why we design our program the way we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2462)|
| 0:41:10| First being safety, safety for the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| We have high-voltage, non-insulated transmission lines that has a potential of arcing from the transmission line to a tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2474)|
| 0:41:23| It does not have to touch a tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| Also, reliability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| Our transmission lines serve the people of the Tennessee Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| One tree could potentially put thousands of customers out of power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| That would include industries, hospitals, streetlights, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| Also, compliance has been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| There is a compliance standard that does apply to a portion of our transmission system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| It does not apply to all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| The industry-wide, we do expect that those standards will, at some point in the future, include lower voltage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2511)|
| 0:41:58| which the majority of our system is built on a 161 kV system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| The fines can be up to $1 million per day that the tree would be deemed in violation of the clearance standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2523)|
| 0:42:10| And it is correct that that has not happened to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| No fine has even reached close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| But the potential is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| TVA has had a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| We are going to receive a fine for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| But the fine is the small part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| The mitigation costs are the larger parts of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| Mitigation costs typically run in the $2 million to $3 million range for industries for one violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2551)|
| 0:42:38| Also, cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| It was mentioned we do have 16,000 miles of transmission line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| Trimming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| If we tried to maintain our system by trimming, the cost would be outrageous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| And, of course, that would relate to the rate payers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| But trying to maintain a system without applying a standard of 15 foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| which was derived from the design of our system, would be very costly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| and the risk of reliability would be really high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| Looking at the slides there on the next page, you have a drawing of kind of a typical right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2586)|
| 0:43:12| This is a very basic drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| Obviously, geography and topography play a role into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| But it gives you an idea on where we would allow the 15-foot mature height trees to be planted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| and that would be in the border zone of the drawing you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| On the next page, this happened in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| On one of the bull run lines, a tree that was within the right-of-way boundaries fell into a transmission line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| It is laying on that transmission line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| and you see the arcing potential that went to ground and caused a fire there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| Also, the next page, that is TVA's transmission system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| This happened back in the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| It's a tree in someone's front yard under the power line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| The landowner wanted to keep the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| There was a lot of going back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| This was during the hot part of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| These lines do sag since they are non-insulated and aluminum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| It sagged down close enough to arc to the tree, went to ground, threw that tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| And if you look at the next page, you'll see where it blew the ground out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| found a path to the house, burnt the electrical system up in the house and the ductwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| The next slide you see there is not on our system, but that is a 500 kV line in the background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2658)|
| 0:44:25| a couple of trees relatively close to the transmission line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| And on the next page, you'll see where it blew the tree apart as it found a path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| the electricity found a path to ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| And the next slide, you'll see where it found a path to the house and burnt the house up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| So we do want to bring those to light because it's not just about compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| I will say that FERC does not tell us, and we've said this many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| FERC does not require us to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| They don't tell us that we have to have a 15-foot mature light policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| Or you have up to one more minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| We design our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| We design our program in response to compliance, safety, reliability and cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2700)|
| 0:45:10| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| I have some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| I just had a question on the one slide where you show the transmission right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| What is the normal transition right-of-way and what are your border zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| On the drawing, Richard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| Our right-of-ways vary on the voltage of the transmission line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2729)|
| 0:45:35| Just take, for example, a 161 kV line, which is the majority of our system, is typically 150 foot wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2735)|
| 0:45:42| So that would be 75 foot in both directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| And then what would your border zone be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| The border zone is, if you look, even though the line is not exactly lined up for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| but it's from the outside conductor to the edge of the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| So if you look at that conductor or the line itself on the outside there, from that power line to the outside power line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2755)|
| 0:46:02| if the tower is like this, from the outside line to the edge of the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| As far as the city goes, what are most of the transition right-of-ways in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2767)|
| 0:46:14| The majority of them are going to be 150 foot right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| We do have 75 foot in each direction, typically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| Is the border zone a certain distance or does it vary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| It varies depending on the design, if it's a pole or a tower and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| We're using the outside conductor to the edge of the right-of-way as that border zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| This is for the TVA guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| I realize that you are a federal agency and we are a municipality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| and so we do not directly regulate you in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| but I hope you will tell your management when you go back that there ought to be a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| a distinction made between transmission lines in rural open country where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2815)|
| 0:47:02| the line is going across the back 40 acres or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| and that swath that's sort of cut there while noticeable is not really directly impacting the property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2826)|
| 0:47:17| and the people around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| As opposed to when you get into a city environment where residential landscaping and the buildings blowing away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2839)|
| 0:47:29| residential landscaping and people's yards are important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| and it may be that you need to consider electing some trimming in densely populated areas as opposed to open rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2852)|
| 0:47:44| You mentioned cost, and I realize cost gets translated to the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| and the rate payers that use your service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| but the flip side is that people's homes and their communities are important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| and we hope that you'll try to respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| And, of course, our resolution asks TVA to look closer at it and to monitor it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| and see if there isn't some way you can moderate your policy so that both interests can be accommodated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2883)|
| 0:48:10| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| Let me reflect what Councilman DellaVolpe just said, and that's, in fact, the sense of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2895)|
| 0:48:23| We want to heighten your sensitivity, if you will, towards cutting and clear cutting and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2903)|
| 0:48:30| And I want to thank very much Larry Silverstein and Ms. Braswell for speaking on behalf of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2910)|
| 0:48:37| I also want to thank Mayor Rojero and her staff who have worked, I think, very hard in making contacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2917)|
| 0:48:44| and trying to do what we can to address this situation, and I think in somewhat of a successful manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2924)|
| 0:48:51| I have asked Mark Donaldson with MPC to try to come up with some program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2931)|
| 0:48:58| and you probably ought to do this in conjunction with TVA so we can discover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2938)|
| 0:49:05| where these transmission lines are and get ahead of this situation as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2945)|
| 0:49:11| I know we can't solve the situation totally, but at least we can notify those homeowners, property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| that this may occur close to them or perhaps in their backyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| and do what we can to mitigate the problem before it becomes a full-blown problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| But thank you, Mayor Rojero, for your actions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| Is there anyone here from Summit Medical over whose property this goes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| Mayor, I'd like to thank you for initiating a conversation with Mr. Kilgore to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| I understand the people who live on Wellington Drive and up in Dean Hill have to be very concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| because this has been a very pleasant buffer between their residential area and a commercial area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2991)|
| 0:49:58| and so this has to be a startling change that is about to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| At the same time, I want to thank you, Mayor, for suggesting that we get some vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| that is acceptable to replace that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| And if Mr. Brace is still here, I understand that you have a team in action ready to go to help resolve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3010)|
| 0:50:21| Do you want to, with the permission of Council, could he speak to that for a moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| Go ahead, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Speak over the rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| David Brace, City Public Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| And I don't know if we have a team in action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| The city is really working as a facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| Mayor Rojero had asked TVA to give the city and Summit an opportunity to look at best management practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3036)|
| 0:50:43| and an opportunity to come in and try to find a planting scheme that will still provide a buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3043)|
| 0:50:50| but be within the TVA guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| We work with David Vandergriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| He's with UT Ag Extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| David is the chair of the city's tree board, a volunteer citizen-driven board that helps guide publicly-owned trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3057)|
| 0:51:05| And so today folks from Summit, from TVA, from the city of Knoxville met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| The city's contractor, we plant about $40,000 to $50,000 worth of trees every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3071)|
| 0:51:17| Our contractor has agreed to hold those bulk rates for Summit, and we are going to work with TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3077)|
| 0:51:23| Right when they exit the site, the city's contractor, working with Summit directly, we're a facilitator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3083)|
| 0:51:30| will come in and as quickly as possible reestablish a tree species that will hopefully provide the buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3090)|
| 0:51:38| and the appearance that we have now just a little bit shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| This is an untenable situation for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| TVA needs to keep that 16,000 miles of line clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| Everybody who gets electricity expects to turn that light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| If they're on a life support system, they don't expect it to go out because of arcing or a sagging line or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3117)|
| 0:52:04| These homeowners and people in the area are really unhappy, and I can understand why they would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3124)|
| 0:52:13| We also know that TVA has brought power to this region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3133)|
| 0:52:18| and my family has property sitting under Chilhowee Dam waters that was taken many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3138)|
| 0:52:25| many years ago when TVA was in the process of bringing electricity to the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| So while I applaud Councilman Saunders and the others who have signed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| this is just a terrible situation for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| I just want to dovetail off of Councilman Dallavopi's plea to at least consider having alternate plans for densely populated areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3163)|
| 0:52:57| And I know that that would be expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| But, you know, in East Tennessee, people come here, people live here because it's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| And part of that beauty is not only the trees but the hills and everything that's unique to us in this part of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3187)|
| 0:53:15| So, you know, hopefully you all could take this back and at least study that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3195)|
| 0:53:21| It's probably not the first time you've ever heard this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| but I certainly think that that is a fair alternative plan for you all to think about moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3203)|
| 0:53:35| I would like to respond, if possible, to the question about urban versus rural when it comes to our transmission lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3215)|
| 0:53:43| The transmission lines aren't exclusive to an urban territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| A transmission line may leave, let's take, for example, Watts Bar and run all the way to Bull Run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3226)|
| 0:53:52| So one transmission line, if vegetation grows, obviously the same if it's in a rural or urban area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3232)|
| 0:53:59| And that fault or interruption caused by a tree in a rural area is the same as if it happened in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3239)|
| 0:54:07| So if we took a different approach within the city, and we have studied it, we have looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| we run the risk, the reliability risk up considerably higher in that city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| Now, it may not necessarily be the city that's affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| It may affect Athens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| An interruption in Knoxville may affect another city or another part of the valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| So I just wanted to point out, as far as the transmission line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| an interruption is an interruption whether it's in the city or in a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| Well, if I may, I mean, I guess let me be a little bit more clear then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| As opposed to chopping them down to the ground in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| how about thinking about trimming them and working with the people that have spent a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3288)|
| 0:54:55| and their yards are nice, and they take pride in making our community beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| And I know you're not from here, but I'm familiar with where you're from, and it's not really different from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| So I guess that would be my point is to not consider taking them all the way down and working with the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3306)|
| 0:55:17| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| Yeah, I mean, I'd just like to reiterate what other people have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| You know, we're in a city, and we're trying to, you know, we care what our city looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| And so this clear-cutting in neighborhoods, it is different than rural communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| So I hope you take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| The other thing, you know, what upsets me about this policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| and I think a lot of the property owners, is they don't really understand why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| I mean, these easements have been around for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| The power lines have been around for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| These people have owned property for years and years and years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| and then all of a sudden now they can't have a tree that can grow over 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3348)|
| 0:55:54| You know, I would just think the PR Department for TVA hasn't done a good job of explaining why all of a sudden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3354)|
| 0:56:01| we need this scorch-and-burn policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| So, you know, I'm certainly going to be supporting the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| My father came with TVA back in the 30s as a forester, came to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| And one of the things that they worked very hard on during the years that he was a forester with TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| is they came up with new and innovative programs, and TVA was known for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3384)|
| 0:56:29| And my question is that it seems like we have a real opportunity here to use Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| as an example of what TVA could do in a setting inside a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| And it would seem to me that a good start would be out where the cypress trees are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| in terms of TVA taking a look at those and seeing what they could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| and set up some kind of a program that would be a beginning program for what you could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3408)|
| 0:56:54| with vegetation near power lines within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| And I would charge TVA with the possibility of looking into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| and being a leader in maybe seeing how they could work with a city and in a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| You've got a lot of cooperative folks here with the administration that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3427)|
| 0:57:13| And before you cut those cypress trees down, I would just ask that you really take a hard look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| at what TVA could do for a city and use Knoxville as an example to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| So I'm pleading that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| Okay. Has Ms. Henry arrived?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| She may not be now with the storm anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| Okay. Then that concludes the speakers for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| Is there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| Did you have somebody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| Okay. Is that okay with counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| I have a substitute speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| Sir, please come down and state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| My name is Sam Lyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| My wife and I live at 7113 Crest Hill Drive for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| During this time, we have raised our five children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| During 2008, several homeowners and I met with the KUB at the library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3486)|
| 0:58:12| which is located at the corner of Kingston Park and Golf Club Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| This was after losing our power in 2008 eight times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3497)|
| 0:58:24| KUB, I must say, did an excellent job trimming back these trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| in the Dean Hill subdivision at this time in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3509)|
| 0:58:34| During June and earlier during the spring of 2011, with the new growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3514)|

| 0:58:54| We'll write our own story, and this story was written about this area in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3534)|

| 0:59:09| We're frugal in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| After the article was published in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| two chipper trucks showed up the next morning and stayed in front of my house for two full days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3557)|
| 0:59:26| and started trimming trees behind my home and my neighbor's homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3566)|
| 0:59:32| I would recall what they did was a glove job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| I promised, I surmised they wanted to show me and my neighbors that they were on the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3575)|
| 0:59:43| If you look at the KUB and other transmissions lines behind the Rowas-Leland-Cypresses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3583)|
| 0:59:50| at Summit Medical Group location, you will find an absolute mess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3590)|
| 0:59:56| which has been there since the spring of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| You will also find other transmission lines from other vendors, Comcast, Nology, telephone cables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3600)|
| 1:00:09| that also need to be properly installed and the debris under the lines be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3609)|
| 1:00:16| Now TVA plans to clear-cut at least 60 Leland-Cypresses trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3616)|
| 1:00:22| that border Summit Medical Group parking lot and other trees, big or small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| within 75 feet of each side of their middle transmission tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| If you've got a tower like they have, which you see on Nayland Drive, 75 feet this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| and 75 feet is going to be clear-cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| Summit Medical Group agreed to plant these Leland-Cypress trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| Am I talking too loud, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| You're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| Summit Medical Group agreed to plant these Leland-Cypress trees as a barrier between their parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3651)|
| 1:00:57| and the neighborhood homes which border this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| This row of trees was planted to suppress the noise from Summit Medical Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3660)|
| 1:01:06| Kingston Park, and the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3666)|

| 1:01:17| I feel that the continued growth of these Leland-Cypress trees will never touch these transmission lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3677)|
| 1:01:25| In addition, I would like to now show a couple pictures of how much time I have left, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3685)|

| 1:01:54| If I offend anybody, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3714)|

| 1:02:20| There's a piece of black plastic on top of that transmission line, and it has never been replaced since 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3740)|
| 1:02:31| These are these beautiful Leland-Cypress trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| Here's what's behind the Leland-Cypress trees in the sense that the growth from the KAUB is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3756)|
| 1:02:50| I have one more statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3770)|

| 1:02:58| I would like to ask TVA to give this picture here to you to pass that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3778)|
| 1:03:06| and if I'm allowed as a character, just don't put me in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| We won't put you in jail, but your time is up, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| My question is, why does TVA want three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3795)|
| 1:03:21| Why does that have to go there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=3801)|

| 1:07:10| We expect that savings from this will be roughly $1.26 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4030)|

| 1:07:49| It's a very, very promising way to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| This is very similar to someone refinancing their house at lower interest rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| The only thing is we've got a lot bigger dollar refinancing than most people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| This is the big house, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| This is a very big house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| Jim, explain why we have two separate authorizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| Are the bonds different in kind or duration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| Is that what's causing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| Or why don't we just have one general obligation bond as a refunding bond that sort of cleans up the old debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4104)|
| 1:08:30| with lower price debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| The distinction that you have on the first resolution is we have not previously issued geo debt for the Amoresco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4113)|
| 1:08:45| That was done through a lease purchase agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| There's no refunding bond at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4128)|
| 1:08:49| So there is no bond to be refunded in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| So what we have to do is pass the initial resolution authorizing us to issue debt for that lease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4132)|
| 1:09:02| And then it is also included as part of the second resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4142)|
| 1:09:07| So, basically, we're going to issue an immediately refund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| So you're consolidating all the debt as existing and then taking it away with a refunding bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| You know, again, the difference is because this was not bond debt before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4158)|
| 1:09:24| it never underwent an initial resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| And so we have to do it in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| If old people like me or widder women are out there looking to buy bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| where can they buy a Knoxville bond that they can invest in if they so choose, obviously?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4172)|
| 1:09:38| Again, we haven't priced the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| The bonds will be bid probably sometime in late April, possibly early May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4180)|
| 1:09:46| We're not sure who will get the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| These will be competitively bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| People then can go and, you know, if they have a broker or whatever, they may be able to acquire them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4191)|
| 1:09:57| Again, the interest rates, we think, are going to be somewhere on the order of between three-tenths of 1% to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4197)|
| 1:10:06| possibly 2.9% on the long end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| And the existing debt is somewhere between three and a half to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4210)|
| 1:10:14| Is that what you said earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| The low end on some of our existing debt is 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| The high end is five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| The Amoresco debt is at 3.96%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| And we, again, that's going to we think that's going to drop to around 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| And you were talking about a net as opposed to the annual amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| And it was a little confusing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| But there's some cost to issuing the bonds and including all the issuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| The gross debt, if you go savings, if you will, are 16.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| We use a present value computation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| You brought them back in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| We brought them back in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| And that's about 14.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| So we have a motion and a second on the first one on H, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| What is that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4260)|
| 1:11:01| 11H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4261)|

| 1:14:20| I am not against the redevelopment of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| I am not against a new hotel at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| I am here on behalf of the owners of the Cumberland House Hotel at 11th and White Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4468)|
| 1:14:35| They are also the Four Point Sheraton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4475)|
| 1:14:40| They built a new hotel in this city in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4480)|
| 1:14:45| They asked if pilot or other economic incentives were available to them and were told no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4485)|
| 1:14:52| So the first year this hotel was opened, they paid nearly $170,000 in property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4492)|
| 1:14:59| Your typical hotel will take four to five years to become profitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| They paid, and that's a combined rate between city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| they paid their full share of property taxes from the date they opened until today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4507)|
| 1:15:14| and will continue paying them in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| Hotel business in this city is very, very competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| There are a number of downtown hotels, hotels on the periphery, such as we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4522)|
| 1:15:28| We are not raising this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| We're simply raising this issue to say we're against the development of that hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| We're simply against granting corporate welfare to them in the form of a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4537)|
| 1:15:44| The application you have, request, has three questions in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4544)|
| 1:15:50| Is this a historic site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| The answer was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| Is this in a redevelopment area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| The answer was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| Is this a brownfield site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| The answer was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| The same would apply to the Cumberland House Hotel also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| So my client's position is if we're not entitled to a pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| why give our competitor over $100,000 a year advantage over us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4570)|
| 1:16:17| This is like giving McDonald's a pilot when there's a Wendy's or a Burger King next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4577)|
| 1:16:26| simply because McDonald's is going in on blighted property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4586)|
| 1:16:32| This gives them a competitive advantage over the other hotels downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| There are, at this time, two other hotels, one under construction in this city, a Holiday Inn Express on paper mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4598)|
| 1:16:46| They are receiving no subsidy from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| There is one plan for the Blue Ridge development on North Shore Drive, a Marriott Courtyard, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4610)|
| 1:16:58| They are receiving no subsidy from any public body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4618)|
| 1:17:04| Why should this particular owner receive a competitive advantage against the other hotel operators in this city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4624)|
| 1:17:13| We simply ask that you turn down the pilot and say, let all the hotels compete on an even basis in this city, which they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4633)|
| 1:17:22| They are very competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| And by granting a pilot, you're, in effect, favoring one over the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4644)|
| 1:17:30| I sent a letter out today, and I was probably wrong on one aspect in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| Mr. Wetzel told me that Cisco had received a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| I thought they'd gotten a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| But anyway, that was for economic redevelopment and JFG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4663)|
| 1:17:47| But they didn't have competitors right down the street who are paying a regular tax rate who were opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4667)|
| 1:17:56| These were both projects to bring new jobs to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| The applicants may argue, we're bringing new jobs, construction jobs, et cetera, to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| Well, every other hotel in this town has brought that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| The Cumberland House spent $15 million on their project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| Land acquisition and construction did not make money for four or five years, but they planned on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4693)|
| 1:18:21| They knew what they were up against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| But you're going to give a competitor here an advantage that no other hotel in the city has at this time in a very competitive situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4704)|
| 1:18:36| And we would ask that you turn down the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| We're certainly not opposed to the competition or opposed to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4719)|
| 1:18:45| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| Okay, Mr. Jordan, Paul Jordan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4729)|
| 1:18:54| Hi, Paul Jordan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| Excuse me just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| Did you want to speak now, Councilman Della Vopi, or wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| I'll wait for the speaker to say his piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| You have name and address, please, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| Valley Woods Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| I'm here opposed to the resolution, as was the last gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| Under the same pretences, I'm representative of the ownership group that recently bought the hill to Knoxville, downtown Knoxville, and 501 West Church Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4755)|
| 1:19:24| As a member of the business community here in the city, the downtown committee, and even a member of the exact industry that this development is proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4764)|
| 1:19:35| I'm in objection because I feel it creates an unfair playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| It gives them financial assistance to start up their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| It also gives them unfair tax benefits going forward for a number of years that, again, none of the other businesses in the industry have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4783)|
| 1:19:51| New competition we welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| It's part of the business, and it's part of every industry, and that's our business, and that's our job to compete with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4792)|
| 1:19:59| But we ask that there be a level playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| Again, this is not a market that is void of ample hotel rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| The market typically runs 50 to 60 percent on a weekly basis and sometimes even lower than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4806)|
| 1:20:11| There are some peak days such as football weekends, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| But by and large, month in, month out, weekend, week out, and throughout the year on a consistent basis, the market is not full, which means there's not a demand for additional hotel rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4814)|
| 1:20:24| It doesn't mean we can't have new competitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| We welcome that, and we want you as our city council members to welcome new business just as we would if we were starting a new business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4826)|
| 1:20:32| But as a representative of an ownership group just over a year ago who spent a substantial amount of money, much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4832)|
| 1:20:39| It's a bigger project, but much more than what's proposed in this to join the Knoxville business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4839)|
| 1:20:45| and then turn right around and immediately spend just over $3 million in renovation with more planned on top of that just to be part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4845)|
| 1:20:52| and be proud to be a part of the Knoxville business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| They do that based on the fact that they're operating under existing tax laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| We generate a substantial amount of tax revenues as we should and as we're proud to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4859)|
| 1:21:05| They're very proud to be a part of this Knoxville community and the business community and supporters of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4865)|
| 1:21:10| and they feel that this ownership group should be the same as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| In addition, for the same reasons he mentioned, for the sake of time, I won't read them all out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| I don't think it meets the provisions as I see them as criteria for being granted a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4877)|
| 1:21:24| In addition to that, these types of programs should be in order to bring business into the city that otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4884)|
| 1:21:31| without this financial aid, would not be coming into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| My understanding is that this group is well down the line in terms of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| already got approval from the brand which they want to go with, which is the same brand family flag that I operate under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4900)|
| 1:21:47| So this is just almost on a whim, but why not try for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| If we can get this, if we can't get this handout, then why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| If we can try for this handout, why not get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| Again, I feel that it's a very unfair advantage to a startup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| and I think it's somewhat of a slap in the face to an ownership group who's paid a substantial amount of money to be a part of this business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4920)|
| 1:22:06| part of this community, and is very proud to pay the taxes that they pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| My last objection is that of just a simple taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| If there's this kind of money, which is substantial over the course of a several-year period, to spend to bring business to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4933)|
| 1:22:20| there's a lot of ways we could spend that that would benefit the city much more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| even to the point of maybe a few years down the road we would have need for more hotel rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4944)|
| 1:22:30| I just ask you as city council members to be considerate of the business operators in the community like myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4950)|
| 1:22:37| and the business owners like the owners that I represent who have been happy to be a part of your community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4957)|
| 1:22:43| support your tax dollars, and not take money from the very tax pool that our businesses create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4963)|
| 1:22:49| and give it to our competitors and give them an unfair advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| Councilman Dellavalti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| I see Bob Wetzel at the ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| I must say that I find it somewhat surprising, but I agree with what Mr. Seymour said, and I don't always say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4984)|
| 1:23:11| But this is a concern because we are giving away tax dollars, presumably as an incentive to help them fix a building that's not in great shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=4991)|
| 1:23:23| On the other hand, it's not part of our downtown, and it is in an area along Cumberland Avenue that has a number of prosperous businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5003)|
| 1:23:33| And I know that you all are looking at radiating rings and everything out from the center city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| but we are giving dollars to a competitor of a number of businesses in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5018)|
| 1:23:43| And I want to hear your justification why you think it's a good deal for the city and for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5023)|
| 1:23:50| I appreciate that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| I appreciate the comments made earlier here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| Obviously, we're proud of all the hotels in this town and what they do and the services they provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5034)|
| 1:23:59| You've heard me stand up in front of you many times and say our goal in the Office of Redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| by the way, Bob Wetzel, Director of Redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| our goal in the Office of Redevelopment is to move from disinvestment to investment in the core of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5046)|
| 1:24:12| After going through our review process, we felt like this was a great project to do that in the heart of our city along the Cumberland Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5052)|
| 1:24:19| And we believe this does help our policy goals of redeveloping Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| and revitalizing buildings in the middle of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| The building is blighted and is set vacant for most of the last ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| not too different from most of our downtown buildings that we've had under these kind of programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| The current owner anticipates spending close to $16 million in acquisition and development costs at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5075)|
| 1:24:41| That would be a significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| That's equal to the amount of dollars we're talking about spending on Cumberland Avenue ourselves in our major road project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5082)|
| 1:24:48| Under the current proposal, we're going to continue to receive the same $40,000 a year in taxes that we've been receiving on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5088)|
| 1:24:55| And that will happen for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| This is just a five-year pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| Many of those in the past have been 10-, 15-year pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| This one is just the request is for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| In five years, it will move up to $100,000, $120,000 a year in taxation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| And we will have that cash flow for a long period of time to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| For the sake of clarity, let me state that the pilot is a tool that can be used anywhere in our community to support economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5114)|
| 1:25:21| It is not restricted to redevelopment areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| Only TIFs are restricted to redevelopment areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| If there was a TIF on the table here, it would have to be in a redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| This is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| But I would say that we have worked, Ann Wallace and I, and Ann is with me here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| we have worked hard to try to work on redevelopment in Cumberland for the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| We certainly consider it a redevelopment district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| And we will be bringing a proposal to you probably in the next year to make it a redevelopment district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5142)|
| 1:25:46| It's a very important commercial corridor in our city, at the heart of our university, our major employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5146)|
| 1:25:52| And this is the kind of project that can kind of help move all of our goals along on that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5152)|
| 1:26:00| A couple of other things I want to mention here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| Mr. Seymour has made the issue out of a couple of questions on our application form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| If you'll look, there's no one on the application form that says these are requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| They just are asking for information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| Is it a historic building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5172)|
| 1:26:13| Is it a brownfield site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| You know, it used to be, was it an empowerment zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| That question is still on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5177)|
| 1:26:18| So those are not qualifications to receive a pilot or a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| Those are simply questions that we need to know as we're going through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| There are considerations that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| There are absolutely considerations, but they're not the only ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| The consideration here is you have a blighted property that's set vacant for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| had numerous code violations to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| In fact, when we first met the potential developer and owner last fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5197)|
| 1:26:41| we started looking at the codes enforcement actions against that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| It's not too dissimilar to some of the earlier discussion we had tonight on how we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| with remediating blighted properties in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| But those are just questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| If you look on the front page of our website where you find this development assistance application form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5216)|
| 1:27:01| it really states our policy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| It says the City of Knoxville, working in conjunction with local economic development agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| including the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| and Knoxville Community Development Corporation, considers incentives to certain development projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| It goes into a number of things, pilots and TIFs, and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| These incentives are considered for projects determined to have economic development benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| to the areas of the city that have been targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| Clearly, Cumberland is an area we targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| We targeted a fair amount of money there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| We felt like this was a program to help move that program along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| So, with that said, that was kind of our justifications for where we got into this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5250)|
| 1:27:36| We felt like it moved from disinvestment to investment in the core of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| We certainly realize the hotel market is a competitive market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| Cumberland Avenue is a competitive environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| We felt like this is a good way to kind of help jump start our redevelopment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| Haven't they already bought the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| They have currently bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5272)|
| 1:27:53| What they're asking for is a pilot so they can finance the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| A pilot would just simply freeze their taxes for the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| What it helps is with the operating costs over the first five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| I think the gentleman alluded to that just a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| It does help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| But they're losers in the beginning and you have to build up the business, the trade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| I'm not an expert in the hotel business by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| Like most businesses, your cash flow at the beginning is usually not as good as it becomes as you build up your trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5294)|
| 1:28:20| So this is a way to help that redevelopment get off the ground over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| I don't want to answer the prospect that you are disadvantaging people who invested their own dollars and took the risk themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5304)|
| 1:28:32| There's still a considerable amount of risk on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| This is still we're not talking about any direct subsidy on the front end at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| There's no cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| There's no check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5319)|
| 1:28:40| There's no money on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5320)|
| 1:28:41| We're simply saying that we want this hotel to have a good chance to operate at a high level over the coming years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5321)|
| 1:28:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| Mr. Wallace has pictures of the existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| Ann might want to pass those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| So you'll just remind us what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| Mr. Laca is here, who is a potential developer, who is the owner of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| and potential developer of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| And he'd like to make a few comments as well, if that's appropriate at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| But we may have questions if that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| Did you think his contingency fee of $390,000, which is less than 10 percent of the construction cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5349)|
| 1:29:16| is reasonable in his application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5356)|
| 1:29:19| Do you think this is a well-financed operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| I think this will be a well-financed operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| I'll turn this over to Mr. Nick Laca with Paramount Hospitality and Knoxville Hotels to make a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5367)|
| 1:29:32| Well, did you say you have finished drawings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| Why don't we wait on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5376)|
| 1:29:37| You want to wait on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5377)|
| 1:29:38| Let's let council call on him if they would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| Should I have him sign up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5380)|
| 1:29:41| We have a Mr. Laca has a rendering of what it's going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| That's simply pictures of what the existing condition is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| That's the blighted property we're trying to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5393)|
| 1:29:54| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| And, Bob, I appreciate the conversations that we had today also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| A couple of questions that I had, I noticed under the assistance requested, one of the things that's troubling me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5402)|
| 1:30:07| it says we're requesting financial assistance in the form of a pilot to bridge the gap of operational losses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5407)|
| 1:30:14| And this is one of the things that the other hotel operators have commented on, that they went into an investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5414)|
| 1:30:19| and they did lose money in operations in the first couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5419)|
| 1:30:24| And so there is a sense of fairness that I think we should look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| The one thing I'm concerned about is that, and correct me on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| but it's my understanding that previous administrations had kind of guidelines for what would be a pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5432)|
| 1:30:39| or what would be a TIF, and part of them are listed here on your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| And so the question I have is, is the present administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5443)|
| 1:30:48| are we going to be setting a precedent by doing this individual building that doesn't meet these guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5448)|
| 1:30:54| Are you coming up with a new set of guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| I mean, where are we going to draw the line between if someone else comes in and has an abandoned building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| and wants to do something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5462)|
| 1:31:03| I mean, where are you going to draw the line on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| I think a couple of things to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| Our redevelopment policies are the same right now as they were this time a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| the same as they were this time four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| Where was the pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| The pilots were used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5477)|
| 1:31:18| The last several projects we did in downtown were pilots as opposed to TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| Certainly, our downtown market pilots became more popular as a gap tool once you couldn't sell as many condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5483)|
| 1:31:31| That's why it became popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5491)|
| 1:31:32| So we had to use those in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| Did you use them mostly for residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| Primarily for residential, some for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| Dr. Lyons might like to make a comment as well on this about our ongoing policy for redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5498)|
| 1:31:44| Bill Lyons, we haven't had any policy change here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| I might add a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5509)|
| 1:31:50| There has been a pilot used previously for a hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| It was for the Hampton Inn downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| That was one, and that was used as part of our policy that is there a public interest in what we're pursuing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5517)|
| 1:32:05| And as Mr. Wetzel pointed out, this is a redevelopment of Cumberland Avenue that the pilot facilitates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5525)|
| 1:32:11| In the case of the Hampton, that facilitated some very critical design elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| That is the original design had the hotel on top of a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5535)|
| 1:32:19| The later design, as you'll see now, brought it down and addressed the streetscape at one of our key corners appropriately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5539)|
| 1:32:26| also provided for another garage, also provided for saving Mary Boyce Temple House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5546)|
| 1:32:31| So it didn't help with saving the house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5551)|
| 1:32:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| But that pilot was used at dealing with the question, does this advance the city's interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5553)|
| 1:32:39| That's the only reason to get involved, and they almost always involve, in this case, an interest beyond just the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5559)|
| 1:32:48| On Cumberland, we're talking about the blighted structure that's there and the Cumberland redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5568)|
| 1:32:53| That would be the equivalent or be the parallel to what happened with the Hampton Inn and that pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5573)|
| 1:32:59| Wasn't the Hampton, though, what you were saying, though, that money was used for construction purposes, not for operational purposes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5579)|
| 1:33:06| Well, I think that is a distinction, but it was talking about making the project viable, economically viable for the operator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5586)|
| 1:33:16| for the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5596)|
| 1:33:17| That could be looked at in terms of initial construction costs or operating costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5597)|
| 1:33:23| however the cash flow would go to make the project work from an economic standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| In either case, neither of these, that project didn't work, and the project, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5607)|
| 1:33:32| needs this assistance to work in a way that would be advantageous to the Cumberland District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| I guess what I'm looking for is that when you talk about the Hampton and we talk about some of the other projects downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5617)|
| 1:33:43| we're talking about bricks and mortar versus operational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| What this request is, what I read on the application is, they're asking for money for operational costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5626)|
| 1:33:51| What the other individuals are telling us that have hotels downtown is that their operational costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5631)|
| 1:33:58| they had to eat that, in essence, to make it go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| And so they did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| And so what we're looking at or what I'm struggling with is a sense of fairness in what we're doing with our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5642)|
| 1:34:08| I do realize that, you know, we take a piece of property, we fix it up, we have additional income in five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5648)|
| 1:34:14| we have employment, we have more people down on Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| But at the same time, these folks also, you know, have spent quite a bit of investment and took quite a bit of risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5658)|
| 1:34:24| Well, I would say to that, I think the overall economic viability of the project is a combination of the construction costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5664)|
| 1:34:30| and the ongoing operating costs and the way that pro forma works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| So, I mean, that is a distinction drawn here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| I think in turn, I don't know that I think it's a defining distinction that would lead to a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5676)|
| 1:34:42| I think it's whether the project becomes economically viable in a way that would benefit the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| is the more global approach that we would take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| Are the owners of this project, are they here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5697)|
| 1:34:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5698)|
| 1:34:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5699)|
| 1:35:00| Since this is my district, I wanted to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| To the gentleman from the Hilton, let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| I worked at the Hilton for about two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| And I'll never forget this Saturday, Tennessee was playing Notre Dame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5711)|
| 1:35:17| And the guy didn't know me from anything, but I would just stand around the lobby and he asked me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5717)|
| 1:35:22| where can I go to spend money in this town?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| And this was before what had transpired on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5725)|
| 1:35:32| I mean, and all that happened because of public investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| We have spent in excess of probably $20 million, $25 million to enhance, develop, create,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5737)|
| 1:35:46| and make a beautiful downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| And every day that you all are in business, you get the benefit of those public dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5749)|
| 1:35:55| So, you know, I hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5755)|
| 1:35:59| But you've got to remember, too, you know, it works both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| So there's been huge investment from the public sector to enhance what you all sell every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5763)|
| 1:36:11| And I understand what you go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| I know it's a hard business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| But let me say this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| You know, we're not writing a check here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| It's, you know, currently the tax rolls, this property is on the tax rolls for $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5780)|
| 1:36:27| So they're going to pay $40,000 a year for five years, and then it goes to $160,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5787)|
| 1:36:34| Now, you know, I understand that, you know, perhaps we turn the first gentleman down that Mr. Seymour spoke to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5794)|
| 1:36:41| If I'd been on council, I would have probably helped him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| I would have probably, if the administration brought it forward, I'd have been fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| But we're getting ready to spend $14 to $15 million, $13 to $15 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| whatever it is, on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| We've got a blighted, boarded building that has been sitting there empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| It's been an eyesore to the University of Tennessee, one of the greatest employers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5821)|
| 1:37:07| one of the greatest institutions that is in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5827)|
| 1:37:11| And we can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| Again, we're not writing a check at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| All we're doing is freezing the tax rate there to enable them to take this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5835)|
| 1:37:22| that otherwise is probably going to sit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| And I don't know what will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| So, you know, for, again, I hear what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5849)|
| 1:37:34| but you've got to remember the amount of money that this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| and the taxpayers of the city of Knoxville has put into downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5857)|
| 1:37:41| and to the area where Cisco is located and old Central Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5861)|
| 1:37:48| And this is what this is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| And sometimes it's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| I mean, the monies that we've given downtown, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| there was other industries that had the same argument, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5876)|
| 1:38:01| could have made the same argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| But when you look at what we got down there now, we got there because of this public investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5883)|
| 1:38:08| So I urge my fellow council members to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5888)|
| 1:38:16| It's going to create good jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| I don't know how many, probably in excess of 100 jobs, 100, 125 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| But at the end of the day, we're going to dovetail off a $13 million to $15 million investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5904)|
| 1:38:31| And this is going to be a nice addition to not only the University of Tennessee's campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5911)|
| 1:38:38| but to an area that we have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| we're defining it as something that we want to invest in and redevelop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| So I urge you to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| Thank you, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| I'm going to ask Dr. Lyons, just for public information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5929)|
| 1:38:53| since we're talking about TIFs and pilots, if you would define the difference between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5933)|
| 1:39:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| What happens is, take with a pilot, it's very simpler to get to grasp, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5942)|
| 1:39:07| because what it means is you just freeze the taxes at the present level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5947)|
| 1:39:11| And whoever owns the property and develops that property doesn't pay the increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5951)|
| 1:39:17| that would go with the reappraisal of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| They keep paying it at the present level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| And then after a number of years, the taxes return and go to what the appraised value would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5962)|
| 1:39:28| With a TIF, it is money that the similar thing happens, the taxes are frozen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5968)|
| 1:39:37| but those dollars the developer uses to get a loan, what's called a TIF loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5977)|
| 1:39:42| where future taxes pay that loan off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| So a TIF is a little more complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| and that allows there to be what's called tax increment financing so that the increase in taxes that do come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5986)|
| 1:39:53| the taxes are paid in a TIF where they're not paid in a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| In a TIF they're paid, but then they're turned around and go back to pay off a loan to help get that project started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=5996)|
| 1:40:02| So I guess the major difference is in a pilot the taxes are not paid, they're frozen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| in a TIF they're paid, but then they are redirected back to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6006)|
| 1:40:11| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| And I want to ask the owner, I guess, of the Hilton Garden, who is here, if everything is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6012)|
| 1:40:21| how soon do you expect to be up and running?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| And you have already started some improvements there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| How soon do you expect to be up and running if everything is approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| Hi, my name is Nick Locka.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| I'm 140 Dalrymple Road, Sandy Springs, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| To answer your question briefly, my competitor pointed out, yes, we are down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6041)|
| 1:40:48| But before I answer your question, we are down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| However, this pilot is very important to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| and without the pilot we could very well stall out on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| So this has a lot to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| If the pilot is approved, we'd like to start possibly as early as June, July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6060)|
| 1:41:05| potentially open first to second quarter of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| That's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| If it would please the Council, I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| and my request for the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| Pleasure, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| I see heads nodding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| So go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| I'll give you up to five minutes, so you can take less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| Like Mr. Wetzel said, my goal is to take this vacant building, which is a blighted building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6094)|
| 1:41:41| It's been deemed by the city as blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| As a matter of fact, the first week after acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| I received a letter from the city that was sent to the previous ownership that this building is blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6106)|
| 1:41:52| There are broken windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| There's trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6113)|
| 1:41:54| There's undesirable activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| I'll tell you, we cleaned that up in the first week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| We'd like to feel that it's continued to stay clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| And we see a real opportunity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| We see an opportunity that this is the first impression for a lot of visitors coming into the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6125)|
| 1:42:11| which I know is a very big component, important component of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6131)|
| 1:42:15| We also recognize an opportunity to coincide with what Ann Wallace and Bob and Bill Lyons are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6135)|
| 1:42:21| with the Cumberland Avenue Improvement Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| We're hotel developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| We're hotel acquirers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| We redevelop properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| We see this as an opportunity to really make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| We can do hotels in Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| The reason we came out of Atlanta is clearly there is an economic benefit to us down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6154)|
| 1:42:41| But we see an opportunity to really do something special here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| And that's the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| The strip can be so much better, I think, with the Cumberland Avenue Improvement Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| And our project is a catalyst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| I see this really taking off, getting kick-started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| To talk a little bit about the operational gap that was sort of focused on, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6177)|
| 1:43:05| most hotels do lose money in the first four to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6185)|
| 1:43:09| I've got in my pro forma that we will lose money in the first four to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6189)|
| 1:43:14| Even with the pilot, we will lose money in the first four to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6194)|
| 1:43:18| Inherently, we'll lose less because of the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| But I think what's most important, and if it pleases the council, I'd like to hand you something to distribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6200)|
| 1:43:26| It's an e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6206)|
| 1:43:31| It's an e-mail, and it's the terms of my loan, non-binding loan commitment from a relationship lender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6211)|
| 1:43:39| who you'll see listed on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| It's very important to note that my lender has point blank told us that without the pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6221)|
| 1:43:47| or failure to obtain the pilot could dramatically affect and impact the loan amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6227)|
| 1:43:52| If we don't get that loan amount that we're talking about, the property won't look like what we've got rendered here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6232)|
| 1:44:00| if Jamaica will show the council what we plan to do with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6240)|
| 1:44:04| You can see what you've got in front of you is the exterior skin of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6244)|
| 1:44:09| We don't want to keep it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6249)|
| 1:44:10| We want to do something that we can be both proud of as well as the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| and hopefully impact the strip positively and, again, make a good first impression for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6254)|
| 1:44:22| To quickly point out some numerics just to get some of the boring things out of the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| we'll have 150 construction jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| We'll have at least 40 full-time hotel jobs, 750,000 plus in payroll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6269)|
| 1:44:37| 500,000 plus in sales and lodging tax generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6277)|
| 1:44:43| And, again, I think it's very important for everyone to recognize that we're not coming here seeking corporate welfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6283)|
| 1:44:48| which to me is hat in hand looking for you or the city to provide us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6288)|
| 1:44:53| We're merely asking for some relief in the form of freezing the taxes for a short five-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6293)|
| 1:45:00| and after that it will ramp back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| I guess I go back to Bill first and say you brought out the Hampton in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6308)|
| 1:45:15| I mean, these guys bought this property in September for $5.6 million with no contingency, I presume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6315)|
| 1:45:23| no contingency of getting this pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| I mean, so they committed then to building this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| The Hampton, was that done pre-construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| Were those terms that you all talked about prior to building that as a way to finance it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| You know, go back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| Thank you, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| I want to make one thing really clear about the Hampton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| That was in no way a model for what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| It was very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6349)|
| 1:45:50| In fact, the fact is that the Hampton was originally granted a pilot by the county IDB, not through the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6350)|
| 1:45:56| and for reasons I can't really explain goes back a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| And we got involved at the city level in order to use the additional pilot, a couple of additional pilot years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6359)|
| 1:46:08| to obtain a public benefit of the design, to get the design altered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6368)|
| 1:46:13| The project was underway at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| It wasn't comparable to this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| Well, give me one that's comparable to this where he's already bought the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6377)|
| 1:46:21| and he's already doing some work to the property, and now we're asking for a pilot almost after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6381)|
| 1:46:29| Well, I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6389)|
| 1:46:30| Bill, I mean, or Bob, or I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| Well, we've had a number of projects where, and by definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| anybody who asks for the aid owns the property when they ask to it, so it's post-purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6395)|
| 1:46:41| So, Bob, you can give a couple of examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| Just typically the ones that we've dealt with the most, obviously, have been the downtown projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6403)|
| 1:46:47| All of those projects have been owned by the developers when they came and asked for whatever type of gap finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6407)|
| 1:46:53| or assistance financing, whether it be the Holston Building, whether it be the Farragut Hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| whether it be the BMC Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| Those properties were owned by people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| They know that the pilot or the TIF is out there as a tool, and they know how to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6422)|
| 1:47:06| and the thought is if you own the property, here's a tool that can help you use to get an old building fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| So it's not unusual to own a building and then look for the assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| and become a relatively recent owner of the building and then look for the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6434)|
| 1:47:19| The point is it's a tool that's worked effectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| and that's why we've recommended it here in this redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| Well, I think everybody wants to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6444)|
| 1:47:25| I mean, it is blighted, and everybody wants to see it redeveloped and for it to look like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6445)|
| 1:47:29| I guess it wasn't expressed in anywhere that the critical need of it until we got this e-mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6449)|
| 1:47:35| or until you handed this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6455)|
| 1:47:36| I mean, I haven't seen that expressed anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6456)|
| 1:47:39| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| It's an evolving process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6461)|
| 1:47:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| Help me with my math a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| There's a difference of, what, about $300,000 on taxes that would be over the next five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| like under the current situation would garner around, I mean, around, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6478)|
| 1:48:04| I'm trying to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| The numbers we've been using have been roughly 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| Currently, that's city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| It's city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6491)|
| 1:48:12| It's 22 city, 18 county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| If the appraisal, it depends on what the appraisal is at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| it's what the property is actually worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| If it's appraised in the $14 million range, we're talking about ongoing taxes in the range of $120,000 to $140,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6500)|
| 1:48:28| So we are talking in the range of easily probably $100,000 a year for five years is the operational gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6508)|
| 1:48:34| But, once again, it goes to the idea that we're going to get a higher level facade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6514)|
| 1:48:39| and a higher level product that helps us kick off the Cumberland Avenue Redevelopment Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6519)|
| 1:48:44| Yeah, no, I want to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| I believe, but I believe in free enterprise and, you know, competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| And I think, you know, it just doesn't seem that this is a deal breaker for these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6531)|
| 1:48:56| They've already started construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| No, they have not started construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| They've cleaned up the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6541)|
| 1:49:02| I was out there today, and it looked like when I walked in that things are beginning to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| Some of the interior structures of the walls and the ceiling are going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6546)|
| 1:49:12| And, I mean, at least from what I could tell, and things are starting to move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6552)|
| 1:49:18| I just feel like that this doesn't meet the criteria that would support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6558)|
| 1:49:23| I mean, if they're so reliant on this, then, I mean, they have started construction, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6563)|
| 1:49:28| No, just to talk to Mr. Locke, that's from the old construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| The N.K. that had the group, they did start some construction back in 2006 and stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6571)|
| 1:49:40| We've not completed our blueprints, our drawings, our construction drawings yet by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6580)|
| 1:49:46| We've got preliminary renderings and things in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| but we would not start construction without a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| We don't have a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| We don't have an ability to start any work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6591)|
| 1:49:54| We do have the ability just to clean up the place, and that's all we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| What you've seen in the building has been that way since 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6597)|
| 1:50:01| It's been sitting in that same condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| Okay, well, I guess that answers some of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| Back to the redistricting, for this to be a redevelopment area where it would qualify more for a pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6609)|
| 1:50:16| did you say that that would happen if, I mean, to help it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6616)|
| 1:50:20| For clarity here, you do not have to be in a redevelopment district to receive a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| If it's a TIF, you do have to be in a redevelopment district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6626)|
| 1:50:27| We have discussed creating a redevelopment district along the Cumberland corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| basically run from Lake to White, 17th to 20th, 17th, really, to the railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6631)|
| 1:50:37| We have not done that for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| One, there have been a lot of things going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| You're going to have a ñ here in two weeks, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| you're going to have a redevelopment district at the far western end of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6643)|
| 1:50:48| So we decided we didn't want to run those parallels, so we run them on a separate track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6648)|
| 1:50:53| So it's ñ and they're investing, Mr. Lockwood, up 14 to 16 million, you say, ultimately, over time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6653)|
| 1:51:04| The total project cost will be just slightly north of 16 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6667)|
| 1:51:08| Well, that, I mean ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| And the equity, the actual equity going in is going to be very close to $4.5 million from the ownership group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6670)|
| 1:51:17| I mean, that's the money we are putting in as equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| and the remainder you can see there is coming in the form of financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| Well, the $300,000 to $500,000, I mean, doesn't seem to be a deal-breaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| I can't imagine that, again, I'm not a loaner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| I think it's safe to say that this hotel in this location is going to do very well, having its proximity to UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6691)|
| 1:51:40| And I think it will do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| So if they were to go forward, they will lose money in the front end, but then they will make money in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6701)|
| 1:51:47| It may not be a deal-breaker, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| But if my financing amount lessens by not a whole lot, this is pretty tight, the building will not be able to look like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6709)|
| 1:51:57| It's going to end up being, and I use this term somewhat loosely, it's going to be more of a patch job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6717)|
| 1:52:01| And it's not going to be something that I'm going to be very proud of, quite honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| and I don't know that it's going to be something that the city can be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| And if the pilot doesn't go through, and if I don't get the financing that I need, the full amount, I've got two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6727)|
| 1:52:14| One is sort of patch it up and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| Because as a hotel operator and someone who's trying to build a company and a platform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6737)|
| 1:52:21| we're only going to do deals that are compelling and that we're proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6741)|
| 1:52:25| We're not going to operate suboptimal hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| And without the pilot, I think I'll end up with a suboptimal product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6747)|
| 1:52:30| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| And with that suboptimal product, if I can't get that done, I may let the building stay as it is and put it back on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6752)|
| 1:52:38| It's been on the market since 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| And my competitors included, a lot of local folks have looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| A lot of people have had an opportunity to take a shot at this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| I'm telling you, I went out on a limb and I'm taking a shot at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6767)|
| 1:52:52| And I'm hoping that the pilot happens so we can make it what it needs to be and what it deserves to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6772)|
| 1:52:57| I mean, you're in a tough business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6777)|
| 1:52:59| And a lot of people go forward and they have the bank roll to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6779)|
| 1:53:03| And it is tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| I want to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6785)|
| 1:53:06| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6786)|
| 1:53:07| I think it is an unfair advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6789)|
| 1:53:10| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6790)|
| 1:53:11| The last thing I want to do is leave the building the way it is, continue to pay the $40,000, put it on the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6791)|
| 1:53:15| and it will sit that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6795)|
| 1:53:16| I mean, it's just not good for my investment, and it's certainly not good for Cumberland Avenue or the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6796)|
| 1:53:23| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6803)|
| 1:53:25| Yeah, just either Bob, could you talk a little bit about the But-For test as part of a pilot and explain that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6805)|
| 1:53:34| As you know, when we go into these products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6814)|
| 1:53:36| there's the two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| Colloquially, there's the who cares, which is the public interest question, obviously, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6818)|
| 1:53:42| That's the redevelopment of Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6822)|
| 1:53:44| Then there's the But-For.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6824)|
| 1:53:45| Would this project go forward but for our support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| I think what you just heard from the developer is the project may or may not go forward but for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6828)|
| 1:53:54| but certainly it would not go forward at the level that we would need to help kickstart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6834)|
| 1:53:58| we feel like, help us kickstart the Cumberland Avenue redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| The But-For is to the level of finish that we will get when the project occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6841)|
| 1:54:05| And also it drops back, as Councilman Wallace has said here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6845)|
| 1:54:09| the financing, the amount of money available on the front end will have a lot to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6849)|
| 1:54:14| Well, you know, I certainly am sympathetic with the other hotel owners in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6854)|
| 1:54:19| but I think the fact this is in such an area that's really going to be targeted over the next couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6859)|
| 1:54:25| I mean, you know, every pilot or TIF we do, you know, potentially gives an unfair advantage to a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6865)|
| 1:54:32| I think in this instance, and I certainly think these photos don't do justice to the blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6872)|
| 1:54:37| I went there today and the building is very blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6877)|
| 1:54:41| You know, Councilman Campbell just talked about it's in a great area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| If it's in such a great area and it's such an easy project, why has it been sitting vacant for years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6884)|
| 1:54:51| You know, we can sit, you know, we can deny this pilot today and it may sit vacant for another five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6891)|
| 1:54:58| And what good does that do us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| I hope we can approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6900)|
| 1:55:01| It sounds like it's going to get done and it will be on the tax rolls in five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6901)|
| 1:55:04| and we'll have a hotel in this area that we're proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| So I'm going to be supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6910)|
| 1:55:11| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6911)|
| 1:55:12| Mr. Wessel, I guess, is the question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6912)|
| 1:55:17| Let's assume for a moment that I'm wavering on my original comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6917)|
| 1:55:22| I don't understand why the pilot has to be a flat waiver of taxes for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6922)|
| 1:55:29| I assume that if they start this business up, the first year is going to kind of stink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6929)|
| 1:55:34| and then over time they're going to build a business so that their revenue stream is going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6934)|
| 1:55:39| Why doesn't the amount of the pilot or the amount of forgiveness change over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6939)|
| 1:55:44| so that it kind of zeroes out after the fifth year when it's got its largest impact in the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6944)|
| 1:55:50| and its diminished impact later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| In other words, why isn't it stair-stepped somehow so that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6952)|
| 1:55:56| Certainly you can structure a deal that way if you chose to structure one that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| I will tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6960)|
| 1:56:01| When the developer first came to us, he was hoping there might be a 10- to 15-year pilot in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6961)|
| 1:56:06| Hope springs eternal, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6966)|
| 1:56:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| So as we worked our way through this process, we felt like the five years was an appropriate way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6968)|
| 1:56:13| We've only done one project so far with the stair-step to get to completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6973)|
| 1:56:18| As we go forward, I think that may be something we need to explore more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| This one seems this is the way we move forward with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| and this is the way we have it in front of you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6983)|
| 1:56:26| Your answer is you compressed it to five years instead of dragging it out a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6986)|
| 1:56:30| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6990)|
| 1:56:31| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6991)|
| 1:56:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6992)|
| 1:56:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6993)|
| 1:56:34| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6994)|
| 1:56:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6995)|
| 1:56:36| Bob, what's the bottom line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6996)|
| 1:56:37| How much money do they actually get over this five-year period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=6997)|
| 1:56:42| It depends on post-project appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7002)|
| 1:56:45| So I don't really know that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| But it will be close to the operating benefit to them will be close to $100,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7007)|
| 1:56:52| which will be the same $100,000 a year the city and county will get every year thereafter after year five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7012)|
| 1:56:58| There's no, once again, no check on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| There's just the taxes are at $40,000 instead of $140,000 or $160,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7021)|
| 1:57:06| And what do you do to check these folks out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7026)|
| 1:57:10| I mean, from finances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| How do we know who these people are and their background?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7036)|
| 1:57:17| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| We ask them to provide documentation and information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| We do a little Internet searching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| We talk some with some other folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| This one, we did some Internet searching and talked with these developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| And they have good projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7049)|
| 1:57:33| And we also had an independent bank review on this project, which said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7053)|
| 1:57:37| this operational gap is real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7057)|
| 1:57:40| They looked at the numbers and said this operational gap is real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| That's what I was going to ask you about, financial folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7062)|
| 1:57:43| Yeah, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7063)|
| 1:57:44| And they said this operational gap is real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7064)|
| 1:57:45| Now, are we guaranteed that a Hilton Garden Inn is going to be the hotel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7065)|
| 1:57:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7071)|
| 1:57:52| Let's talk process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7072)|
| 1:57:53| If this council approves this going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7073)|
| 1:57:56| the next place it goes will be to the Industrial Development Board for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7076)|
| 1:58:00| If that board approves, their staff working on it, we move towards a non-development agreement similar to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7080)|
| 1:58:08| It's a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7088)|
| 1:58:09| It's a lease because the title to the property will, in effect, go to the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7089)|
| 1:58:13| And the lease will be for the amount of this pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| In that lease, that will be one of the requirements that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| And if we do not produce that, then we back out of the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7100)|
| 1:58:23| They get their property back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| And, therefore, the taxes would be at the new rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7105)|
| 1:58:27| So this is just the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7107)|
| 1:58:28| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7108)|
| 1:58:29| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7109)|
| 1:58:30| This is a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7110)|
| 1:58:31| It's an important step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| The Industrial Development Board wants to do the city's will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| and the city's will is generally reflected by the will of the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| So they're an independent body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| And they'll wait through a lot of these same questions you all are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| My point being, we will have a lease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| The fact that we want it that the facade is to look this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7126)|
| 1:58:49| and that it will be the Hilton Garden Inn is real and be a part of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7129)|
| 1:58:53| And if that fails to happen, then we can cancel the lease and it will be appraised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7133)|
| 1:58:57| and the taxes will start at whatever the taxes are at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7137)|
| 1:59:01| So there are checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| There are checks and balances as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7145)|
| 1:59:06| The other thing, too, is I think that Councilman Pavlis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| I think you brought up a good point over the fact that what we have done in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| for the other hotels, that that is some consideration in terms of what we have downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7153)|
| 1:59:20| and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| So I think that was a good point that you brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| But thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7165)|
| 1:59:26| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7166)|
| 1:59:27| I've listened to all of this patiently for some while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7167)|
| 1:59:32| And there are some points that really kind of stick with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7172)|
| 1:59:38| Councilman Campin made a great point about its location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| and it looks to me like something that can operate and operate fairly quickly into the black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7182)|
| 1:59:49| But most interestingly was what Councilman Della Vopi said just a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7189)|
| 1:59:56| which I've been thinking about for some while as some sort of a we all want this redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7196)|
| 2:00:01| We don't want to see that eyesore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| But I'm very sensitive to other hotels, not just downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| but throughout this community that have done it on their own pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7208)|
| 2:00:12| And, yeah, there's been some public help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| There's been a lot of public help, as Vice Mayor Pavlis said, in the downtown area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7214)|
| 2:00:18| and in other areas of this city for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7218)|
| 2:00:22| But the idea, and Councilman Della Vopi didn't use these words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7222)|
| 2:00:26| but the idea of some sort of a compromise, if you will, to help get this started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7226)|
| 2:00:32| I just can't imagine a good developer doing something less quality over essentially $500,000 on this size project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7232)|
| 2:00:44| That just doesn't compute with me because I think the developer, his own pride that he just expressed, won't let that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7244)|
| 2:00:56| And I'm troubled by the amount, even though, relatively speaking, it's not a huge amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7256)|
| 2:01:03| But I just can't imagine this being a deal breaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7263)|
| 2:01:06| So I'll have to make that decision when we get around to voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7266)|
| 2:01:09| I understand there's a lot of judgment calls in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7271)|
| 2:01:14| I just want to ask one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7274)|
| 2:01:17| Mr. Locke, how many projects similar to this have you done in Atlanta or total around the region?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7277)|
| 2:01:23| Currently, my company owns five hotels, four of which we own and operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7283)|
| 2:01:28| We've never asked for a pilot or any sort of tax incentive or any public incentives at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7288)|
| 2:01:33| So hotel-wise, we've got several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7293)|
| 2:01:36| Public incentive, zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7296)|
| 2:01:39| But let me tell you, Mr. Saunders, what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| It's not really a $500,000 difference over five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7302)|
| 2:01:45| What happens is that $100,000 tax savings over a one-year period equates to a repayability in the bank's mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7305)|
| 2:01:54| That $100,000 on a cap rate, not to get too complicated for you, equals over a million dollars in loan proceeds at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7314)|
| 2:02:04| So that's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7324)|
| 2:02:07| It becomes a significant amount of money that I'm going to borrow from a lender up front to put into that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7327)|
| 2:02:16| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7336)|
| 2:02:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7337)|
| 2:02:18| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| This hotel has sat down there as an eyesore to this community for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7340)|
| 2:02:27| As Councilman Vice Mayor Pavlis pointed out, we've invested a lot of money in downtown areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7347)|
| 2:02:33| and other areas where hotels have been built or remodeled that did not have this benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7353)|
| 2:02:39| I, for one, do not want to see that property sit vacant for one more year because we'll only be getting $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7359)|
| 2:02:49| We wouldn't be getting $100,000 if it sits vacant for two years, three years, four years, five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7369)|
| 2:02:56| We're out that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7376)|
| 2:02:58| We are not out that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7378)|
| 2:02:59| We're enabling this company to be able to get the financing they need to put in a quality hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7379)|
| 2:03:06| Competition is very healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7386)|
| 2:03:09| If you look at the location of fast food stores, if you can get a Burger King and a Wendy's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7389)|
| 2:03:15| it's not long before McDonald's is right on the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| And amazingly, all their drive-thrus are filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7398)|
| 2:03:21| So I really feel like that the addition of another quality hotel in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7401)|
| 2:03:27| will not hurt these other businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7407)|
| 2:03:31| I think it will enhance all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| But most importantly, it will be a good beginning for this Cumberland redevelopment project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7413)|
| 2:03:39| that we have talked about forever and is about to come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7419)|
| 2:03:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7423)|
| 2:03:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7424)|
| 2:03:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7425)|
| 2:03:46| Is there anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7426)|
| 2:03:47| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7427)|
| 2:03:48| Can I just make one remark in response to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7428)|
| 2:03:50| I agree with you, Ms. Palmer, that we all want this redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7430)|
| 2:03:54| There's no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7434)|
| 2:03:55| We want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| I just can't imagine this amount of money putting this thing in the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7437)|
| 2:04:02| So we all want the same thing, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| And we all have put we want we just want a level playing ground is all I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7444)|
| 2:04:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7450)|
| 2:04:11| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7451)|
| 2:04:12| I just want to reiterate, it's not about the actual money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7452)|
| 2:04:14| It's about what that means to a banker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| And a lot of developers will tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| That makes a big impact on the bankers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7460)|
| 2:04:22| And that's money being invested in the brick and mortar of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7462)|
| 2:04:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| Seeing no further lights, I'm sensing we need a roll call on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7469)|
| 2:04:33| I'm going to ask Ms. Mitchell to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7473)|
| 2:04:36| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7476)|
| 2:04:43| I like to be called Les.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7483)|
| 2:04:46| I guess I'm going to give you an aye based on what I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7486)|
| 2:04:50| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7490)|
| 2:04:57| I'm going to say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7499)|
| 2:05:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7500)|
| 2:05:01| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7501)|
| 2:05:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7502)|
| 2:05:03| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7507)|
| 2:05:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7508)|
| 2:05:09| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7509)|
| 2:05:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7510)|
| 2:05:11| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7511)|
| 2:05:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7512)|
| 2:05:13| Councilman Kampen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7513)|
| 2:05:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7514)|
| 2:05:17| Now can I change my vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7517)|
| 2:05:22| Would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7522)|
| 2:05:23| Do we do that in council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7525)|
| 2:05:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7526)|
| 2:05:27| The vote passes eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7530)|
| 2:05:31| That was a really great discussion, I thought, on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| Mayor, I just want to, again, I want to make sure we're going to get a Hilton Garden in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7533)|
| 2:05:41| Hilton Garden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7543)|
| 2:05:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| Better to point it out that I'm already down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7545)|
| 2:05:47| I wouldn't be here if it were potentially going to be a Motel 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7547)|
| 2:05:51| It's going to be a Hilton Garden in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7551)|
| 2:05:52| You'll be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7552)|
| 2:05:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7553)|
| 2:05:54| Nor would we have brought you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7554)|
| 2:05:58| That's good, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7558)|
| 2:06:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7560)|

| 2:07:23| I think, did we get a second there, Tim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7643)|

| 2:07:29| Thank you, Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| Brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7651)|
| 2:07:32| This is an annual update to the One-Year Plan that we do every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7652)|
| 2:07:36| We bring it to you in April of each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7656)|
| 2:07:40| We conduct three public meetings throughout the city to explain changes that have occurred to the One-Year Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7660)|
| 2:07:47| as a result of individual applications and annexations throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7667)|
| 2:07:53| This past year there really haven't been a lot of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7673)|
| 2:07:56| and ironically we got some of the best attendance that we've had in recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7676)|
| 2:08:01| So a lot of people have seen the plan, and it's little changed from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7681)|
| 2:08:08| One of the things we have suggested is a series of general rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7688)|
| 2:08:14| We've identified some in each of the six districts that the city council may wish to pursue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7694)|
| 2:08:20| to help bring the One-Year Plan in alignment with the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7700)|
| 2:08:29| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7709)|
| 2:08:31| Okay, Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7711)|
| 2:08:32| Yes, as long as we've got Mark opining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| I guess I'm troubled because as I read through this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7715)|
| 2:08:38| and there's a lot of good information about both planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7718)|
| 2:08:41| and how we divide up property in terms of different land use categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7721)|
| 2:08:49| we on a regular basis will get an application to rezone a property along with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7729)|
| 2:08:54| a change to the One-Year Plan or the sector plan, the same kind of day meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7734)|
| 2:09:00| whatever you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7740)|
| 2:09:02| And I guess I'm troubled because the purpose of this One-Year Plan is to look out 12 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7742)|
| 2:09:06| and say not only kind of what we have but where we're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7746)|
| 2:09:10| but we seem to be able to reverse course on a dime and change it for an individual track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7750)|
| 2:09:16| Could you address that in terms of the propriety of doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7756)|
| 2:09:20| We set the plan to kind of dictate the future for 12 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7760)|
| 2:09:24| but we seem very flexible in changing course in midstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7764)|
| 2:09:30| Well, on the one hand, things change over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7770)|
| 2:09:35| But more importantly, the language of the charter, which was done back in 1982,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7775)|
| 2:09:40| has a statement that reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| The One-Year Development Plan shall provide the basis for zoning of all properties within the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7782)|
| 2:09:49| And starting in 1982, the One-Year Plan has morphed into a redundant zoning map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7789)|
| 2:09:58| in order to bring the One-Year Plan into compliance with the existing zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7798)|
| 2:10:04| which is a little backwards from generally accepted planning theory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7804)|
| 2:10:11| where the zoning implements the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| So we are constantly struggling with a changing development pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7815)|
| 2:10:23| Our sector plans are updated regularly as well, and we have these three maps then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7823)|
| 2:10:30| the land use plan and the sector plan, the One-Year Plan and the zoning map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| that we are now trying to bring into conformity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7834)|
| 2:10:38| but for a period of time, for decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7838)|
| 2:10:42| the One-Year Plan reflected the zoning that was out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7842)|
| 2:10:47| not necessarily the plan for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7847)|
| 2:10:52| Sometimes we get applications where we have to change the sector plan but not the One-Year Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7852)|
| 2:10:57| and sometimes we get applications where we have to change the One-Year Plan but not the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7857)|
| 2:11:02| and sometimes we get applications where we have to do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7862)|
| 2:11:08| Mr. Frost would like to comment as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7868)|
| 2:11:10| Thank you. This is before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7870)|
| 2:11:11| Could you go to the blackboard and graph that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7871)|
| 2:11:14| This is before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7874)|
| 2:11:15| My comments are before Mr. Donaldson's time and ask Mr. Swanson to correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7875)|
| 2:11:20| I believe the One-Year Plan can be amended four times a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7880)|
| 2:11:25| and when that process was instituted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7885)|
| 2:11:28| some folks advocating being able to amend the One-Year Plan 12 times, once every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7888)|
| 2:11:35| Other folks wanted to do it once a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7895)|
| 2:11:39| and I believe the brokered compromise between all people, which has been the standard since then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7899)|
| 2:11:43| and has been allowing the One-Year Plan to be touched on four times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7903)|
| 2:11:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7910)|
| 2:11:54| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| Is the Law Director frowning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7916)|
| 2:11:57| No, I'm not frowning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7917)|
| 2:11:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7918)|
| 2:11:59| That's what it says in the plan itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7919)|
| 2:12:00| but we regularly pass things that say change the One-Year Plan, change the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7920)|
| 2:12:05| Councilman Campen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7925)|
| 2:12:06| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7926)|
| 2:12:08| Mark, refresh my memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7928)|
| 2:12:11| What is allowed under R1, R1A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7931)|
| 2:12:16| R1 and R1A are both called our low-density residential zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7936)|
| 2:12:21| The R1A allows some residences by right that are uses on review in R1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7941)|
| 2:12:32| and it extends the residential uses to include some very small apartment buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7952)|
| 2:12:37| and row houses that aren't allowed in R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7957)|
| 2:12:40| Okay, or LDR, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7960)|
| 2:12:43| I was just looking in the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7963)|
| 2:12:47| Number 11, it states the currently zoned R2, yada, yada,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7967)|
| 2:12:53| and slope protection surrounded by LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7973)|
| 2:12:57| and then it says rezoned R1, R1A, RP1 at less than 6 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7977)|
| 2:13:02| So is that in essence saying that the slope protection area is being removed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7982)|
| 2:13:09| No, that would be a recommendation that we change the base zoning underneath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7989)|
| 2:13:14| that slope protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7994)|
| 2:13:16| There is a large segment of the city currently zoned R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=7996)|
| 2:13:20| which is our general residential district, developed in neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8000)|
| 2:13:26| and the R2 is essentially an apartment, allows apartment development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8006)|
| 2:13:31| up to 24 units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8011)|
| 2:13:35| We pretty regularly recommend down zonings of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8015)|
| 2:13:41| Okay, I see, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8021)|
| 2:13:42| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8022)|
| 2:13:44| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8024)|
| 2:13:47| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8027)|
| 2:13:48| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8028)|
| 2:13:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8029)|
| 2:13:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8030)|
| 2:13:51| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8031)|
| 2:13:53| 12E is an ordinance approving the request of Graham Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8033)|
| 2:13:56| for an amendment to the Northwest City Sector Plan from office to commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8036)|
| 2:13:59| for property located on the southeast side of Old Callahan Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8039)|
| 2:14:03| north of Clinton Highway, 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8043)|
| 2:14:06| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8046)|
| 2:14:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8047)|
| 2:14:08| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8048)|
| 2:14:10| Yes, I guess I'm a little troubled by this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8050)|
| 2:14:14| We had one from Mr. Graham maybe a month ago that dealt with a section of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8054)|
| 2:14:20| Clinton Highway that had some changes to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| and we divided part of it into C4 and part of it into a different commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8064)|
| 2:14:29| zone that had some use on review protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8069)|
| 2:14:35| I'm concerned that we might be jettisoning the plan zones here just because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8075)|
| 2:14:41| easier for a developer to develop land with no visit to the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8081)|
| 2:14:47| but we're giving up the idea that a visit to the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8087)|
| 2:14:54| and the planning department gives you a chance to make sure that developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8094)|
| 2:14:59| conform in a proper way and are nudged in a direction that works to protect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8099)|
| 2:15:05| overall zoning area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8105)|
| 2:15:07| And that was illustrated by the materials in this package that seemed to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8107)|
| 2:15:12| about the fact that the staff recommended it stay in a plan zone area and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8112)|
| 2:15:18| the adjoining properties, while bigger, were part of a plan zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8118)|
| 2:15:22| and successfully zoned by a Lowe's and another structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8122)|
| 2:15:25| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8125)|
| 2:15:26| Are we just running to dump all of the plan zones and get it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8126)|
| 2:15:31| into a commercial free-for-all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8131)|
| 2:15:33| Or are we doing something positive for the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8133)|
| 2:15:36| There is a value to these plan zones that we may be giving up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8136)|
| 2:15:41| and I'm concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8141)|
| 2:15:42| I hope after the speaker speaks, Mr. Donaldson might address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8142)|
| 2:15:46| but we seem to be going against the grain on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8146)|
| 2:15:49| Mayor Rojero?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8151)|
| 2:15:52| I'd like to respond to Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8152)|
| 2:15:54| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8154)|
| 2:15:55| Did you go out and look at this property, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| I've been down those roads, but I haven't looked today at that property, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8159)|
| 2:16:03| But you've not looked at this specific property recently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8163)|
| 2:16:05| No, but I looked at the maps and the area and the locale, and I know that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8165)|
| 2:16:08| Well, one of the things that's unique about this area is that it's very piecemeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8168)|
| 2:16:14| in the way it's been annexed into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| So we've got a piece of property here that's in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8177)|
| 2:16:20| and a piece that's in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8180)|
| 2:16:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8182)|
| 2:16:24| We also have a great deal of development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8184)|
| 2:16:29| There are adjacent properties that are C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8189)|
| 2:16:32| There are planned commercial properties also, all of which Mr. Graham has developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8192)|
| 2:16:38| He is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| If you would like to hear him respond to your questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8200)|
| 2:16:43| or if you have specific questions about this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8203)|
| 2:16:46| I'm sure that Council would indulge us to allow him to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8206)|
| 2:16:50| I guess I'd rather hear from Mr. Donaldson first because I am concerned that we're going against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8210)|
| 2:16:55| the recommendation of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| We went with the Planning Commission the last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8217)|
| 2:17:00| and I'm concerned that it's been zoned planned commercial in various forms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8220)|
| 2:17:05| whether it's the city or the county flavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| And I don't see what we are doing other than giving up the opportunity to protect the pace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8227)|
| 2:17:17| or the style or the appropriateness of adjoining developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8237)|
| 2:17:22| And I realize that the flip side is flexibility with the developer in this market is their argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8242)|
| 2:17:29| We'll give them a better chance to see it developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8249)|
| 2:17:32| But we do run the risk as a community that we're not taking advantage of the guidance of our planning department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8252)|
| 2:17:39| So maybe I should ask Mr. Donaldson if you would take one or two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8259)|
| 2:17:42| If I could speak before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8262)|
| 2:17:44| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8264)|
| 2:17:45| If you would take 15 minutes, you will note that the Planning Commission on page 402 for 12E| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8265)|
| 2:17:52| and on page 423 for 12F, the Planning Commission itself voted to grant Mr. Graham's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8272)|
| 2:18:01| The staff had a different recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8283)|
| 2:18:04| And the staff are the professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8284)|
| 2:18:05| and the commission is a body of citizens and realtors and others who are pro-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8285)|
| 2:18:10| And we are talking about planning as a protective tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8290)|
| 2:18:14| And so the staff is the pertinent question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8294)|
| 2:18:18| Well, it strikes me then that your comments are pretty disrespectful to the MPC commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8298)|
| 2:18:24| Be that as it may, I'm asking about the planners and the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8304)|
| 2:18:28| And I respect what the commission does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8308)|
| 2:18:29| But it was eight to four, and there were questions there about why abandon a planned zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8309)|
| 2:18:34| And Mr. Donaldson, take a minute if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8314)|
| 2:18:38| Keep in mind that there are two items on the agenda that are related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8318)|
| 2:18:41| The first one that has been read is the plan amendment to go from office to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8321)|
| 2:18:47| And everybody agrees that commercial is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8327)|
| 2:18:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8330)|
| 2:18:51| There was no dispute on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8331)|
| 2:18:52| Then moving on to the zoning, simply it's a case where we have an existing planned commercial zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8332)|
| 2:19:00| in place adjacent to development that occurred in a planned zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8340)|
| 2:19:06| And we believe that the review of a site plan for this property would pay benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8346)|
| 2:19:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8357)|
| 2:19:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8358)|
| 2:19:19| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8359)|
| 2:19:20| Could we have Mr. Graham speak to this issue, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8360)|
| 2:19:24| on why he would like to have the zoning he's requested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8364)|
| 2:19:27| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| If I might clarify one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8369)|
| 2:19:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8371)|
| 2:19:32| Mr. Seymour, you're going to speak instead of Mr. Graham?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8372)|
| 2:19:35| Whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8375)|
| 2:19:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8376)|
| 2:19:37| Yeah, you all had signed up for the other one, but certainly this is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8377)|
| 2:19:43| You know the routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8383)|
| 2:19:44| State your name, address, and I'll give you up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8384)|
| 2:19:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8387)|
| 2:19:48| I'm Tim Graham, 5555 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8388)|
| 2:19:52| Mr. Seymour just passed out two or three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8392)|
| 2:20:02| or one attachment with two or three attachments to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8402)|
| 2:20:04| The first one, the request is if you look at the small little track, it's basically a single family house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8404)|
| 2:20:20| And the CB zone, the neighbor right beside it, is an electrician that operates out another house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8420)|
| 2:20:27| And so it's kind of an island in itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8427)|
| 2:20:30| And so there's no use to have a planned zone for that particular piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| So we requested the C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8434)|
| 2:20:37| And then the larger track that is about five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8437)|
| 2:20:42| No, it's two and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8442)|
| 2:20:43| Well, but only two and a half is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8443)|
| 2:20:46| The rest is in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8446)|
| 2:20:48| And so I feel pretty comfortable we'll get a CA or CB zone in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8448)|
| 2:20:57| So to have a planned zone for only two acres is not really very logical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8457)|
| 2:21:04| The second thing is that the shopping center is not connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8464)|
| 2:21:12| There's cross-easement agreements with our anchor tenants that don't permit cross-access unless they permit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8472)|
| 2:21:23| So we have done a little plan on the, I think, the second page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8483)|
| 2:21:29| which is mainly four pads that we've considered maybe putting our main office at on one of the pads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8489)|
| 2:21:39| But effectively just it's, again, it's just four or five acres that we would develop there and build three or four buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8499)|
| 2:21:50| And then the last plan is the third sheet is basically some businesses right across the street or next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8510)|
| 2:22:02| You can see the house that joins us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8522)|
| 2:22:05| But, again, there's CB zone between our two partials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8525)|
| 2:22:11| And there's CB or CA or C4 next to us or across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8531)|
| 2:22:18| And then in light that there's only two acres, a planned zone, I believe, requires 20 acres or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8538)|
| 2:22:24| So, you know, there's only so much you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8544)|
| 2:22:28| There's a plan that we've had that, quite frankly, we'll probably execute on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8548)|
| 2:22:33| There's nothing fancy about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8553)|
| 2:22:35| It's not really a difficult and especially in light of all our neighbors have a C4 or CB or CA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8555)|
| 2:22:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8568)|
| 2:22:49| If I may just chime in, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8569)|
| 2:22:56| There are three parcels in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8576)|
| 2:22:59| One of them is six-tenths of an acre, and it's disconnected to the other parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8579)|
| 2:23:06| A planned zone, and it's that one just right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8586)|
| 2:23:13| That's the little house we're talking about, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8593)|
| 2:23:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8595)|
| 2:23:16| Right next to it are two parcels separated by a county property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8596)|
| 2:23:21| And this property is jumbled up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8601)|
| 2:23:24| Part of it's in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8604)|
| 2:23:25| Part of it's in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8605)|
| 2:23:27| It's really hard to figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8607)|
| 2:23:29| It's a little over two acres, two and a half acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8609)|
| 2:23:33| That is not property that you would typically develop under a planned zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8613)|
| 2:23:40| which envisions larger mixed-use properties according to the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8620)|
| 2:23:46| And if I may just read the preamble, general description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8626)|
| 2:23:52| the PC-1 district is established to provide for the unified development of uses ranging from retail stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8632)|
| 2:23:59| and services to community shopping centers to business and professional offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8639)|
| 2:24:05| It envisions a larger development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| It also requires deed covenants before as part of the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8647)|
| 2:24:12| Typically, a development like this would be sold to individual owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8652)|
| 2:24:18| unlike your typical shopping center where you would have a unified development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8658)|
| 2:24:25| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8665)|
| 2:24:27| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8667)|
| 2:24:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| Arthur, on this, is the color part county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8671)|
| 2:24:35| It's both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8675)|
| 2:24:36| It's both county and city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| It's just illustrating the prevalence of C-A, C-B, county zoning, C-4, city zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8678)|
| 2:24:48| But now what we're looking at, part of your development that you show on the second page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8688)|
| 2:24:56| part of that's in the county and part of it's in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8696)|
| 2:24:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8698)|
| 2:24:59| Would you be willing to be annexed into the city or your property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8699)|
| 2:25:03| I'm sure we're going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8703)|
| 2:25:04| He's going to be asked to as soon as something starts coming out of the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8704)|
| 2:25:09| Mr. Emmett, did you not see Mr. Emmett come over and inquire of Mr. Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8709)|
| 2:25:13| Did you say he's looking forward to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8713)|
| 2:25:14| Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120403?start=8714)|
