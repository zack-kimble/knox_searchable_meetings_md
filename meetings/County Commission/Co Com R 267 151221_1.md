| 3:05:43| Applicant is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11143)|
| 3:05:49| I'm still here. Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11149)|
| 3:05:53| Here on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11153)|
| 3:05:55| And after you hear the MPC report, I'd like to speak briefly on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11155)|
| 3:05:58| Is there opposition present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11158)|
| 3:06:00| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11160)|
| 3:06:02| Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11162)|
| 3:06:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11165)|
| 3:06:07| The MPC did recommend 11-I, rezoning at a density of up to 3 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11167)|
| 3:06:14| As stated, this property is in the rural growth area of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11174)|
| 3:06:18| which restricts development to 3 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11178)|
| 3:06:21| The Planning Commission was aware of that and wanted to honor that mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11181)|
| 3:06:26| I would agree with Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11186)|
| 3:06:29| I believe he will state to you that the growth policy plan needs to be revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11189)|
| 3:06:33| I agree with that so that the Planning Commission and the staff are not tied to something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11193)|
| 3:06:38| which has not been reviewed for over a dozen years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11198)|
| 3:06:41| and that we can logically identify those areas in which growth is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11201)|
| 3:06:46| and can accommodate that growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11206)|
| 3:06:49| However, given the mandate of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11209)|
| 3:06:52| the Planning Commission and the staff do recommend a density of 3 dwelling units per acre for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11212)|
| 3:06:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11219)|
| 3:07:00| The recommendation is 3 dwelling units from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11220)|
| 3:07:05| Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11225)|
| 3:07:07| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, our request was for 4 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11227)|
| 3:07:13| Upon reflection, we would request 3.6 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11233)|
| 3:07:18| The MPC opposition to this, as I understand, is the urban growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11238)|
| 3:07:24| which was adopted in January of 2000, I believe it was 2000, 15 years ago anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11244)|
| 3:07:34| The urban growth boundary plan or the growth policy plan mandated that every 3 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11254)|
| 3:07:41| it be reviewed and changes made to reflect changes in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11261)|
| 3:07:47| That has not occurred in 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11267)|
| 3:07:50| Speaking to the area we're concerned with, which is off Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11270)|
| 3:07:55| in those 15 years, Pellissippi State has gone from, I suspect, 3,000 students to nearly 10,000 students now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11275)|
| 3:08:05| Hardin Valley Road has been improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11285)|
| 3:08:09| There is now available at this site gas, water, sewer, and electrical, which was not available at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11289)|
| 3:08:19| Since the adoption of the growth policy plan, Hardin Valley High School has been built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11299)|
| 3:08:26| and is open, or Hardin Valley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11306)|
| 3:08:30| The elementary school out there has been constructed and is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11310)|
| 3:08:34| This body has authorized funding for a new middle school for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11314)|
| 3:08:41| This is a very popular area for people to move to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11321)|
| 3:08:48| It's evident by the number of houses going up in the area now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11328)|
| 3:08:53| Mr. McClure, I think, will have his houses sold out as soon as they start coming out of the ground out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11333)|
| 3:09:03| We would ask that the rule designation of the growth policy plan not tie your hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11343)|
| 3:09:11| in the hands of the community as we go forward in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11351)|
| 3:09:17| There has been a complete change in the area in the past 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11357)|
| 3:09:22| Mr. Sanders and I have discussed this at length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11362)|
| 3:09:25| I think by the failure of the growth policy plan committee to consider any changes in the past 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11365)|
| 3:09:35| they have basically abandoned the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11375)|
| 3:09:37| State law regarding annexation has changed considerably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11377)|
| 3:09:43| Now municipalities can only annex with the approval of the property being annexed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11383)|
| 3:09:51| or on request of the property being annexed, even if it is out of the urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11391)|
| 3:09:57| Although not stated explicitly in the enabling legislation for this law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11397)|
| 3:10:05| it was designed to stop aggressive annexations by cities such as Knoxville and other cities throughout the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11405)|
| 3:10:15| State law has today stopped that with the new anti-annexation ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11415)|
| 3:10:21| So what this statute was designed to protect is no longer needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11421)|
| 3:10:28| If calling the urban growth boundary committee back together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11428)|
| 3:10:33| I think maybe one or two of the members are no longer with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11433)|
| 3:10:37| Several have moved out of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11437)|
| 3:10:41| It would require the mayor of Farragut, the mayor of Knox County, and the mayor of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11441)|
| 3:10:46| to reconstitute this committee and consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11446)|
| 3:10:50| I respectfully submit the plan has been abandoned and has been superseded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11450)|
| 3:10:56| and that you all can consider the 3.6 units per acre that my client requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11456)|
| 3:11:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11463)|
| 3:11:05| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11465)|
| 3:11:08| Mr. Seymour and I have discussed this matter at length,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11468)|
| 3:11:12| although he's made an argument that the commission should disregard the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11472)|
| 3:11:19| State law requires us to adopt the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11479)|
| 3:11:22| and it also requires that subsequent land use decisions be made consistent with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11482)|
| 3:11:28| I do not find that the arguments about change in circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11488)|
| 3:11:34| or failure to have meetings to review the growth policy plan from time to time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11494)|
| 3:11:41| are a sufficient basis to disregard the plan altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11501)|
| 3:11:46| So I'm of the opinion that you have to make land use decisions consistent with the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11506)|
| 3:11:54| just like you do with the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11514)|
| 3:11:59| It's been discussed here tonight that the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11519)|
| 3:12:01| only allows densities up to three dwelling units per acre in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11521)|
| 3:12:06| so that is your authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11526)|
| 3:12:09| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11529)|
| 3:12:11| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11531)|
| 3:12:13| My comment is for Mr. Green, the NPC, or the question, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11533)|
| 3:12:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11537)|
| 3:12:18| You said that you kind of feel the same way that Mr. Seymour does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11538)|
| 3:12:21| that it needs to be reviewed and it may not be sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11541)|
| 3:12:25| or the plan may not be where it needs to be today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11545)|
| 3:12:28| I guess my question is what would you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11548)|
| 3:12:30| what would NPC feel comfortable with on a recommendation on that piece of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11550)|
| 3:12:34| had you not been dealing with the urban plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11554)|
| 3:12:37| That I can't answer because we stuck with the mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11557)|
| 3:12:40| and I think the law director stated it very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11560)|
| 3:12:44| it is a mandate from the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11564)|
| 3:12:46| and we stuck with that and said it's suitable for up to three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11566)|
| 3:12:52| as mandated by the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11572)|
| 3:12:55| What is the difference on this piece of property, the 3.6 and the 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11575)|
| 3:12:59| The number of units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11579)|
| 3:13:01| I'll have to do some quick math here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11581)|
| 3:13:04| Oh, that's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11584)|
| 3:13:05| Let's see, it would be 20 times .6 and about 10 lot difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11585)|
| 3:13:13| 10 and 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11593)|
| 3:13:19| I'm done for right now, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11599)|
| 3:13:22| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11602)|
| 3:13:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11605)|
| 3:13:26| Mr. Green, I attended the NPC meeting when this item was heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11606)|
| 3:13:30| and the attorney for the NPC advised the NPC commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11610)|
| 3:13:35| that unless they voted for up to three dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11615)|
| 3:13:40| then that would be illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11620)|
| 3:13:42| That is correct in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11622)|
| 3:13:44| I recollect that there was a motion to approve the ability for dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11624)|
| 3:13:51| which failed and the law director provided the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11631)|
| 3:13:56| and the guidance to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11636)|
| 3:13:58| So in turn, if we voted anything higher than three units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11638)|
| 3:14:02| we would be in violation of the state statutes then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11642)|
| 3:14:05| I would let your law director answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11645)|
| 3:14:08| And that is correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11648)|
| 3:14:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11649)|
| 3:14:10| So if we don't want to be in violation, like something else that happened earlier tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11650)|
| 3:14:16| we would have to then vote for three units or less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11656)|
| 3:14:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11659)|
| 3:14:20| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11660)|
| 3:14:22| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11662)|
| 3:14:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11664)|
| 3:14:26| Mr. Law Director, a possible solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11666)|
| 3:14:31| If we voted for three, is it possible that they could go to the BZA and get the other .6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11671)|
| 3:14:41| No, because subsequent land use decisions must be consistent with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11681)|
| 3:14:47| That would include decisions made by this body and the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11687)|
| 3:14:51| There's not really a way to appeal this decision to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11691)|
| 3:14:55| What they deal with there every month are variances of the rules and regs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11695)|
| 3:15:01| that us and MPC and so forth have set forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11701)|
| 3:15:04| So we're talking, in essence, right here, a variance from that particular number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11704)|
| 3:15:17| It would still be inconsistent with the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11717)|
| 3:15:21| and even if there were a procedure to appeal this decision to the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11721)|
| 3:15:25| they can't make decisions that are inconsistent with the policy plan or the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11725)|
| 3:15:34| Okay, I'm not going to chase that rabbit anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11734)|
| 3:15:37| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11737)|
| 3:15:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11739)|
| 3:15:42| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11742)|
| 3:15:45| I'll sit back over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11745)|
| 3:15:47| Just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11747)|
| 3:15:50| You know, on the MPC in 2000, we discussed the sector plan and this urban growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11750)|
| 3:15:56| and one of the things that came up that we discussed during those meetings is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11756)|
| 3:16:00| we're going to be stuck with this plan, and that was one of the things that the review was initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11760)|
| 3:16:06| what we originally talked about was you had to review the plan because situations changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11766)|
| 3:16:12| and you're saying that it's never been revisited in 15 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11772)|
| 3:16:18| Commissioner Seymour, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11778)|
| 3:16:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for letting me go before Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11779)|
| 3:16:25| The plan itself required that the committee review it every three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11785)|
| 3:16:29| and make recommendations where appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11789)|
| 3:16:32| To our knowledge, and I checked with Mr. Buick, who was involved intimately in the development of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11792)|
| 3:16:39| that committee has never met since January of 2000, and it would be very hard to round them up now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11799)|
| 3:16:48| I know when we talked on MPC about this urban growth because there was vast pieces of land that were being taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11808)|
| 3:16:55| and saying this is how you're going to use it down the road, and I said, well, times will change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11815)|
| 3:16:59| and I know we had a pretty heated discussion about what to do on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11819)|
| 3:17:03| but if it hasn't been reviewed every three years like it's supposed to and like it was recommended to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11823)|
| 3:17:12| now we're in a situation that we can't do what is the best for the use of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11832)|
| 3:17:18| and that's what we did the urban growth plan for is the best use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11838)|
| 3:17:24| So how do we get around that even though the recommendation of what we were to do has not been done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11844)|
| 3:17:32| I'm sorry to Mr. Law Director there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11852)|
| 3:17:35| There is a provision, there is a procedure for amending the policy plan, the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11855)|
| 3:17:42| and it would, as Mr. Seymour indicates, would be difficult to convene the original committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11862)|
| 3:17:50| However, there is also procedure for appointing new members of that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11870)|
| 3:17:54| and if the commission desires to revise the growth policy plan, that's the procedure that we need to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11874)|
| 3:18:01| Okay, and that procedure would be, how hard is it to go through that procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11881)|
| 3:18:08| Well, I can advise you about that with some research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11888)|
| 3:18:16| but there's a procedure for either convening the original coordinating committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11896)|
| 3:18:21| or if you can't convene that coordinating committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11901)|
| 3:18:24| there are absent members or members not willing to serve, you can appoint new members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11904)|
| 3:18:30| It would be a difficult procedure, but it would not be impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11910)|
| 3:18:34| Okay, if we go ahead right now with the way it is and what we have to do by law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11914)|
| 3:18:40| how will this affect to this property if we do something later on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11920)|
| 3:18:46| Well, if the commission amends the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11926)|
| 3:18:53| that would indicate a new development guidelines and policies in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11933)|
| 3:19:00| so it could come back up for rezoning after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11940)|
| 3:19:09| Yeah, Mr. Brown asked that you're talking about several months, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11949)|
| 3:19:14| Likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11954)|
| 3:19:15| A year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11955)|
| 3:19:16| Several dozen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11956)|
| 3:19:18| A year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11958)|
| 3:19:19| More than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11959)|
| 3:19:22| More than a year, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11962)|
| 3:19:24| Maybe not that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11964)|
| 3:19:25| I mean, as he mentioned, you've got to have, and all my life I've known him, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11965)|
| 3:19:29| but you've got to have the mayors and everybody involved putting people on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11969)|
| 3:19:36| I thought we just talked about rocket science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11976)|
| 3:19:38| It's not rocket science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11978)|
| 3:19:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11979)|
| 3:19:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11980)|
| 3:19:41| You're right, Commissioner Brown, your light was not on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11981)|
| 3:19:46| The mic still works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11986)|
| 3:19:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11989)|
| 3:19:50| Commissioner Bussler, please continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11990)|
| 3:19:56| I'm going to ask the applicant, what is your pleasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=11996)|
| 3:20:07| My pleasure is to have the property rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12007)|
| 3:20:13| Well, having heard that, I'm going to turn my light off and recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12013)|
| 3:20:19| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12019)|
| 3:20:21| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12021)|
| 3:20:23| We have a real problem here, because I think it's going to be very hard to reconvene this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12023)|
| 3:20:28| and we're kind of hand-tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12028)|
| 3:20:33| Our goals and objectives have been to move away from sprawl and to save our ridgetops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12033)|
| 3:20:39| and here we have a piece of property that looks relatively flat that we can't put density on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12039)|
| 3:20:48| In an area that is of high growth, where do we go from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12048)|
| 3:20:54| How hard is it to convene this thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12054)|
| 3:20:59| It would take some appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12059)|
| 3:21:02| From whom? Three different mayors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12062)|
| 3:21:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12065)|
| 3:21:07| I think what we could do is approve three points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12067)|
| 3:21:11| If we could approve three and have Arthur challenge it, it may go through the court faster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12071)|
| 3:21:15| than it can go through the appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12075)|
| 3:21:18| Let's pause for just a second, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12078)|
| 3:21:21| Just as a point of clarification, a slope analysis was done for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12081)|
| 3:21:26| and based on that, the recommendation of the density is 2.6 units per acre is set forth in the hillside protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12086)|
| 3:21:33| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12093)|
| 3:21:37| 2.6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12097)|
| 3:21:40| Commissioner Smith, you're finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12100)|
| 3:21:43| I just wonder what we're going to do and how we're going to go about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12103)|
| 3:21:46| and is it going to be that we're going to have to overzone something and it be challenged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12106)|
| 3:21:51| or is a property owner going to have to challenge it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12111)|
| 3:21:58| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12118)|
| 3:22:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12120)|
| 3:22:02| Well, first off, the developer is very well recognized in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12122)|
| 3:22:06| and there's nothing that we're saying, you know, against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12126)|
| 3:22:10| We're just trying to follow what state law is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12130)|
| 3:22:12| Mr. Seymour, the state mandated that all 95 counties had to file a growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12132)|
| 3:22:21| Are you aware of any legal filings where a county has done what we're trying to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12141)|
| 3:22:31| No, I am not aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12151)|
| 3:22:33| I think the counties with metropolitan government, Davidson, Moore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12153)|
| 3:22:39| Trousdale counties may have been exempt, but that still leaves 92 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12159)|
| 3:22:46| And in my discussions with Mr. Buch and Mr. Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12166)|
| 3:22:50| we have not found one way or another whether other counties have their growth committees meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12170)|
| 3:22:59| on any kind of regular basis or not, so I can't advise you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12179)|
| 3:23:03| But the original growth policy committee lasted about 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12183)|
| 3:23:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12188)|
| 3:23:10| And I think they were so tired of one another in the process that they didn't want to get together again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12190)|
| 3:23:19| But, anyways, I'm going to follow state law on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12199)|
| 3:23:22| and I, again, don't have anything against the developer, but I feel like I have to follow state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12202)|
| 3:23:28| I think if I ask Mr. McClure, I mean, we don't have time to challenge this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12208)|
| 3:23:34| There are people out there in Hardin Valley that want to move out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12214)|
| 3:23:38| especially when the new middle school is finished, because you can go K-1 through 12 out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12218)|
| 3:23:44| but there's simply not the time to have a challenge here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12224)|
| 3:23:49| It might be good for Knox County to consider some sort of declaratory action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12229)|
| 3:23:54| and I'm sure some people would be happy to join in with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12234)|
| 3:24:02| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12242)|
| 3:24:03| Yes, I'd like to make a recommendation, please, that we approve three per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12243)|
| 3:24:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12249)|
| 3:24:14| The motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12254)|
| 3:24:16| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12256)|
| 3:24:20| Mr. Seymour, you hear the motion, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12260)|
| 3:24:23| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12263)|
| 3:24:24| For a density as recommended by MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12264)|
| 3:24:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12269)|
| 3:24:33| If there be no further discussion, the motion is properly before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12273)|
| 3:24:37| to approve this rezoning per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12277)|
| 3:24:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12283)|
| 3:24:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12284)|
| 3:24:45| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12285)|
| 3:24:48| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12288)|
| 3:24:49| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12289)|
| 3:24:50| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12290)|
| 3:24:51| Yes, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12291)|
| 3:24:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12292)|
| 3:24:53| Could we also make a move that somebody re-look at our urban growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12293)|
| 3:25:00| so we don't run into this problem again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12300)|
| 3:25:04| We can have that as a discussion item in the January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12304)|
| 3:25:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12307)|
| 3:25:08| One other suggestion, Mr. Chairman, is maybe ask our state legislature to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12308)|
| 3:25:16| whether or not the chapter establishing these growth policy plans should not be amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12316)|
| 3:25:24| or the act repealed, part of it has been implicitly repealed on annexations by the state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12324)|
| 3:25:33| and I think it's just an oversight they haven't looked at this chapter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12333)|
| 3:25:39| It might be worth asking them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12339)|
| 3:25:41| I intend to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12341)|
| 3:25:43| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12343)|
| 3:25:44| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12344)|
| 3:25:45| Okay, we're on page 17, and we're going to hear item 11-F-15-UR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12345)|
| 3:25:53| which is a request of aggregates USA LLC for approval of plan of operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12353)|
| 3:25:58| for expansion of mining and mineral extraction operation in the A agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12358)|
| 3:26:03| and I industrial zones as shown on the plan of operations, amendment one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12363)|
| 3:26:08| The property is located north side of East Raccoon Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12368)|
| 3:26:11| east of Interstate 75 in the 7th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12371)|
| 3:26:16| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12376)|
| 3:26:21| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12381)|

| 3:26:30| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12390)|
| 3:26:34| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12394)|
| 3:26:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12398)|
| 3:26:39| As mandated by the county's ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12399)|
| 3:26:42| aggregates USA has presented a plan of operations to permit the expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12402)|
| 3:26:47| of their mining and mineral extraction operation in the agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12407)|
| 3:26:51| and industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12411)|
| 3:26:53| The planning commission, Metropolitan Planning Commission, reviewed that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12413)|
| 3:26:57| heard from staff, and recommended that that plan be accepted by a unanimous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12417)|
| 3:27:03| vote on consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12423)|
| 3:27:05| The recommendation was subject to ten conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12425)|
| 3:27:08| Most of those conditions are standard conditions that they comply with various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12428)|
| 3:27:12| state and local ordinances and laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12432)|
| 3:27:14| There was one that no new access to Raccoon Valley Drive be constructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12434)|
| 3:27:19| without amending the plan of operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12439)|
| 3:27:22| and that the quarry expansion be subject to any change that would be revised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12442)|
| 3:27:28| to reflect any changes mandated by Knox County Departments as part of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12448)|
| 3:27:32| review and compliance with their standards and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12452)|
| 3:27:36| The plan does provide for some screening and buffering of adjacent properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12456)|
| 3:27:41| through berms of vegetation and also existing un-vegetated berms will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12461)|
| 3:27:47| vegetated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12467)|
| 3:27:48| The plan does comply with all standards set forth in the county's ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12468)|
| 3:27:52| and again, the Metropolitan Planning Commission has unanimously recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12472)|
| 3:27:56| approval of that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12476)|
| 3:28:02| Seeing no lights, no discussion, is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12482)|
| 3:28:07| I make a motion that we accept MPC's recommendation in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12487)|
| 3:28:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12493)|
| 3:28:16| We properly have before us a motion and second to accept the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12496)|
| 3:28:23| or excuse me, the plan as recommended by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12503)|
| 3:28:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12507)|

| 3:29:03| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12543)|
| 3:29:07| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12547)|
| 3:29:11| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12551)|
| 3:29:17| Thank you, sir, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12557)|
| 3:29:20| The request before you is for a sector plan amendment from Low Density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12560)|
| 3:29:24| Residential and Office to Business Park Type 1 for approximately 345 acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12564)|
| 3:29:30| parcel located on the north side of Interstate 40 near the Midway Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12570)|
| 3:29:34| interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12574)|
| 3:29:36| The Metropolitan Planning Commission has recommended approval of the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12576)|
| 3:29:40| change request by a vote of 8-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12580)|
| 3:29:43| There were discussion and comments regarding the standards for amendment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12583)|
| 3:29:53| a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12593)|
| 3:29:55| The majority of the planning commission did feel the conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12595)|
| 3:29:59| particularly with the changes in utilities in that area and the need for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12599)|
| 3:30:05| employment in that area necessitated and justified a change in the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12605)|
| 3:30:10| plan for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12610)|
| 3:30:14| The property has been identified in the 2005 industrial potential locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12614)|
| 3:30:21| for business park development prepared by MPC as a site for potential business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12621)|
| 3:30:27| park development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12627)|
| 3:30:29| That plan, again, was done in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12629)|
| 3:30:32| The 2010 sector plan amendment, I guess in spite of that recommendation in an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12632)|
| 3:30:38| earlier publication, did recommend or designate the area for low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12638)|
| 3:30:43| residential and office uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12643)|
| 3:30:45| Again, with the changes as reflected with utility upgrades and the needs for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12645)|
| 3:30:50| employment in that area and some other items that justified the change in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12650)|
| 3:30:56| sector plan amendment, the majority of the planning commission did recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12656)|
| 3:31:00| approval of that sector plan amendment, noting that the need for industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12660)|
| 3:31:05| development and business employment in Knox County, particularly in that section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12665)|
| 3:31:11| of Knox County, called for revisions and new looks at the sector plan and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12671)|
| 3:31:17| way it treated the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12677)|
| 3:31:19| The uses of that property under the sector plan amendment would be dictated by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12679)|
| 3:31:26| the zoning that the commission might approve for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12686)|
| 3:31:30| The sector plan amendment would allow for rezoning of the property to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12690)|
| 3:31:34| employment center, which sets a high bar for development of the property as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12694)|
| 3:31:39| business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12699)|
| 3:31:41| The plan for development of that property would be a use on review and would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12701)|
| 3:31:45| subject to review and approval by the Metropolitan Planning Commission staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12705)|
| 3:31:49| and the commission itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12709)|
| 3:31:51| There are standards set forth in the employment center zoning for landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12711)|
| 3:31:56| for infrastructure, for buffering, and for signage and lighting that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12716)|
| 3:32:02| protect adjacent properties and be consistent with the proposed sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12722)|
| 3:32:07| amendment or the requested sector plan amendment and with assuring compatibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12727)|
| 3:32:13| with adjacent properties and uses on those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12733)|
| 3:32:16| With that, I'll stop on the sector plan amendment and provide additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12736)|
| 3:32:20| information regarding the proposed zoning request when that comes before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12740)|
| 3:32:24| board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12744)|
| 3:32:25| I'd be happy to answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12745)|
| 3:32:29| Seeing no questions, the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12749)|
| 3:32:35| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12755)|
| 3:32:37| Good evening, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12757)|
| 3:32:39| Todd Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12759)|
| 3:32:40| The address is 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12760)|
| 3:32:43| And also, Mr. Tom McAdams, who is representing Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12763)|
| 3:32:47| I'd like for him to make some comments immediately following mine if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12767)|
| 3:32:52| As I stated, my name is Todd Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12772)|
| 3:32:54| I'm here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12774)|
| 3:32:56| My capacity as President and CEO of Development Corporation of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12776)|
| 3:33:00| And also, I'm here representing our board of directors in support of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12780)|
| 3:33:04| Development Corporation's application for a sector plan amendment and rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12784)|
| 3:33:08| of its property along Interstate 40 at exit 402.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12788)|
| 3:33:12| The Development Corporation was chartered in 1991, as I believe most of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12792)|
| 3:33:16| know, five of the 13 board members served by virtue of elected office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12796)|
| 3:33:20| And this was really by design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12800)|
| 3:33:22| Because the Development Corporation's desire and intent to carry out activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12802)|
| 3:33:25| for the greater benefit of the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12805)|
| 3:33:28| And we want to do this to make our county a better place to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12808)|
| 3:33:31| provide greater opportunities for employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12811)|
| 3:33:33| and to help our citizens maintain a higher standard of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12813)|
| 3:33:36| And the reason I mention this is just to reinforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12816)|
| 3:33:39| Development Corporation is a public benefit organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12819)|
| 3:33:42| And its mission is to facilitate job creation and incentivize private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12822)|
| 3:33:46| development activities throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12826)|
| 3:33:50| As you know, one significant way that we are engaged in this process is by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12830)|
| 3:33:54| facilitating job creation is through the development and ownership of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12834)|
| 3:33:58| business park properties to ensure that Knox County will have business-ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12838)|
| 3:34:02| sites for the recruitment of businesses and accommodate the expansion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12842)|
| 3:34:06| existing companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12846)|
| 3:34:09| We work very closely with Knox County, the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12849)|
| 3:34:12| the Industrial Development Boards, Tennessee Valley Authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12852)|
| 3:34:15| our Innovation Valley Partners, KUB, State of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12855)|
| 3:34:20| Knoxville Chamber, and a host of others to make sure that Knox County can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12860)|
| 3:34:24| remain competitive in attracting, growing, and retaining businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12864)|
| 3:34:28| and job opportunities they bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12868)|
| 3:34:31| The decision to pursue development of a business park at this location was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12871)|
| 3:34:35| not a decision that we made lightly or without considerable planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12875)|
| 3:34:39| Two separate county-wide studies, as Mr. Green mentioned, one in 2002 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12879)|
| 3:34:44| a subsequent in 2005, both identified the Midway Road property as a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12884)|
| 3:34:49| location for business park development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12889)|
| 3:34:52| And there were five primary criteria used to identify sites within Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12892)|
| 3:34:56| County under this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12896)|
| 3:34:59| They included terrain, large tracts of vacant land, compatibility with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12899)|
| 3:35:03| surrounding land uses, accessibility, and utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12903)|
| 3:35:07| This property is near the Midway Road interchange, either currently meets or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12907)|
| 3:35:11| can easily meet all five of these criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12911)|
| 3:35:14| So Knox County is really well-positioned in many ways to make the most of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12914)|
| 3:35:17| growth economy and to increase local jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12917)|
| 3:35:21| But one very fundamental way we're not as well-positioned, Knox County does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12921)|
| 3:35:25| not have an abundance of real estate options to offer companies looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12925)|
| 3:35:29| sites where they can locate and or expand their operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12929)|
| 3:35:33| Most of the buildings that become vacant as part of the Great Recession have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12933)|
| 3:35:37| since become reoccupied, including the recent acquisition of the former| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12937)|
| 3:35:42| General Electric building in Eastbridge Business Park by Lifetime Products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12942)|
| 3:35:47| which I'm happy to say over the next five years is poised to create 500 new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12947)|
| 3:35:52| jobs in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12952)|
| 3:35:55| But most of these existing buildings have become reoccupied, so we're seeing a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12955)|
| 3:35:58| shift in demand toward land options upon which to be able to build new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12958)|
| 3:36:02| facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12962)|
| 3:36:04| And over the years, various factors have changed regarding how important any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12964)|
| 3:36:09| particular factor might be when looked and ranked by the eyes of companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12969)|
| 3:36:13| looking for places to locate their facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12973)|
| 3:36:17| However, there's one factor that has remained consistently important and near| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12977)|
| 3:36:20| the top, and that's proximity to highway and interstate access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12980)|
| 3:36:25| Interstate Exit 402 is the last remaining undeveloped track of interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12985)|
| 3:36:30| interchange in Knox County, and we're so very fortunate that we really have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12990)|
| 3:36:34| this opportunity to be able to develop this property in such a way that it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12994)|
| 3:36:37| leveraged job creation for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=12997)|
| 3:36:40| Developing property, particularly when it's a business park, as we all know, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13000)|
| 3:36:44| not quick, it's not easy or inexpensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13004)|
| 3:36:47| In fact, it's very involved, very lengthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13007)|
| 3:36:50| It was in 2006, actually, when a development corporation first identified and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13010)|
| 3:36:55| then got this property initially rezoned, acquired the property, and then took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13015)|
| 3:37:03| ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13023)|
| 3:37:06| It's not in the best interest of Knox County to delay this any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13026)|
| 3:37:10| It's been going on for nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13030)|
| 3:37:12| This property meets all the criteria for a business park site as well as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13032)|
| 3:37:15| criteria for the requested sector plan and zoning changes being sought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13035)|
| 3:37:20| The requested action before you this evening will allow us to begin the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13040)|
| 3:37:23| steps toward realizing a business park at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13043)|
| 3:37:27| Your approval does not mean that the opportunity for review and public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13047)|
| 3:37:31| is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13051)|
| 3:37:32| In fact, a positive vote of this evening on your part is really what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13052)|
| 3:37:35| necessary for the process to truly begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13055)|
| 3:37:39| It's not possible to have meaningful discussion about site-specific design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13059)|
| 3:37:44| issues if we don't even know whether the development of a business park would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13064)|
| 3:37:48| even be supported and approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13068)|
| 3:37:50| It is only after we have the requested sector plan amendment and employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13070)|
| 3:37:53| center zoning in place that we can seriously begin working on the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13073)|
| 3:37:58| plan for the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13078)|
| 3:38:00| So the development plan would be the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13080)|
| 3:38:02| A development plan is a blueprint for the public and private aspects of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13082)|
| 3:38:05| development and the process proposed business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13085)|
| 3:38:10| Development plan would have to be approved, as Mr. Green said, by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13090)|
| 3:38:13| Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13093)|
| 3:38:15| It will detail road locations, building lots, conservation areas, walking areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13095)|
| 3:38:20| storm water control, signage, landscaping, setbacks, lighting, building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13100)|
| 3:38:26| materials, building heights, types of uses permitted, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13106)|
| 3:38:31| So I respectfully request your support for application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13111)|
| 3:38:34| We can finally move forward with this very important and much-needed project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13114)|
| 3:38:38| As I said, Mr. McAdams is going to follow me with some additional comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13118)|
| 3:38:42| in support of our application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13122)|
| 3:38:44| I would like to also mention that we do have with us several of the different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13124)|
| 3:38:47| consultants that we've used throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13127)|
| 3:38:50| We have our engineer from Vaughn and Melton here handling general engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13130)|
| 3:38:56| We have someone from Cannon and Cannon who can talk about traffic impacts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13136)|
| 3:39:00| if you're so interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13140)|
| 3:39:02| We have someone from S&ME who can talk about environmental, geotechnical issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13142)|
| 3:39:07| We have Ms. Childress here from KUB who can answer questions related to utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13147)|
| 3:39:13| And also Rhonda Rice here from the Nassau Chamber, if you have questions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13153)|
| 3:39:17| economic development and recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13157)|
| 3:39:19| So with that, I'll turn it over to Mr. McAdams, if you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13159)|
| 3:39:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13169)|
| 3:39:30| I'm Tom McAdams with Bernstein Stair McAdams, 116 Agnes Road, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13170)|
| 3:39:37| Our firm serves as counsel to the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13177)|
| 3:39:40| I want to give you a little background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13180)|
| 3:39:42| I know this property has been in the news for a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13182)|
| 3:39:46| It was acquired in 2006 by the Development Corporation after going through the zoning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13186)|
| 3:39:56| and that was followed by litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13196)|
| 3:39:58| And the litigation challenged the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13198)|
| 3:40:02| and the rezoning that were adopted at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13202)|
| 3:40:05| The Chancery Court ruled that MPC, in effect, took no action at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13205)|
| 3:40:11| and therefore the sector plan was not amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13211)|
| 3:40:14| And it also held that if the sector plan was not amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13214)|
| 3:40:19| then there was not support for the rezoning that followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13219)|
| 3:40:23| The question of what's different today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13223)|
| 3:40:26| The answer is that the Chancery Court ruling indicated two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13226)|
| 3:40:29| One was that MPC did not follow the proper procedure at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13229)|
| 3:40:36| It followed the procedure it had followed for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13236)|
| 3:40:38| which was to recommend sector plan amendments to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13238)|
| 3:40:43| In fact, state law said MPC had to adopt it, not just recommend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13243)|
| 3:40:48| So the Chancery Court ruling was based on the technical issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13248)|
| 3:40:53| that it was not approved and adopted by MPC, but was simply recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13253)|
| 3:41:00| This time, MPC has adopted the proposed sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13260)|
| 3:41:05| A change in the state law now submits it to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13265)|
| 3:41:09| and the adopted plan does not become operative unless you also adopt that sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13269)|
| 3:41:16| So we think we have cured the technical issue that led to the dismissal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13276)|
| 3:41:21| The court's other finding was that there was not adequate evidence in the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13281)|
| 3:41:27| to support the changed circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13287)|
| 3:41:30| and other factors that support a sector plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13290)|
| 3:41:34| So if you'll bear with us, we want to ensure that the record does adequately reflect the changed circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13294)|
| 3:41:44| And a lot of this will just be summarizing because we've submitted to you in advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13304)|
| 3:41:49| the statements that were filed with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13309)|
| 3:41:53| We've submitted the appendix that was filed with MPC, the supplemental appendix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13313)|
| 3:41:59| and other information, and those have been filed with the clerk tonight as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13319)|
| 3:42:04| Those were part of your agenda package, and we hope you've had the opportunity to review those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13324)|
| 3:42:12| Another change in the process this time has been the Development Corporation's approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13332)|
| 3:42:17| The first time this went through, the Development Corporation was trying to buy land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13337)|
| 3:42:21| and like anyone, trying to make prudent use of their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13341)|
| 3:42:25| So they couldn't go out and announce in advance what they were doing or the prices would have gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13345)|
| 3:42:31| So admittedly, it was something of a surprise to the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13351)|
| 3:42:35| that they just could not tell them in advance what they were doing or it would have impacted the prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13355)|
| 3:42:41| This time, the Development Corp., with the assistance of the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13361)|
| 3:42:45| conducted an extensive public input process on numerous occasions, tours of other business parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13365)|
| 3:42:53| tours of this particular site, to community meetings to discuss issues, find out questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13373)|
| 3:43:01| and then to respond to those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13381)|
| 3:43:04| The mayor was very helpful in facilitating an on-site meeting and dinner for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13384)|
| 3:43:10| who were interested in discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13390)|
| 3:43:12| So there has been extensive public input and an extensive number of questions asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13392)|
| 3:43:18| The Development Corporation has heard that and intends to address many of the issues that were raised at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13398)|
| 3:43:25| and has already addressed some of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13405)|
| 3:43:28| For example, there were concerns expressed about a cemetery which adjoins the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13408)|
| 3:43:33| and the Development Corporation has agreed to accommodate the expansion of that cemetery on its property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13413)|
| 3:43:41| through its development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13421)|
| 3:43:45| They also have heard a lot about concerns about the karst soil, about closed depressions on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13425)|
| 3:43:54| which are common throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13434)|
| 3:43:56| They're common throughout other Development Corporation business parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13436)|
| 3:44:00| It's something that is addressed during the engineering process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13440)|
| 3:44:04| and it's something that you either have to avoid or deal with on an engineering basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13444)|
| 3:44:11| and that is what the Development Corporation would do if this is approved through the development plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13451)|
| 3:44:18| The zoning requested is EC Employment Center, which is, in my opinion, the most planned of the planned zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13458)|
| 3:44:26| It requires a list of proposed permitted uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13466)|
| 3:44:29| You have to submit architectural, landscaping, lighting, and signage plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13469)|
| 3:44:34| a development plan showing the location of buildings, loading docks, driveways, parking lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13474)|
| 3:44:39| an estimate of the maximum number of employees on the site, a storm drainage plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13479)|
| 3:44:44| and such other information as MPC may request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13484)|
| 3:44:49| When a development plan gets approved, those conditions are part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13489)|
| 3:44:55| So if this sector plan amendment and if this rezoning are approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13495)|
| 3:45:00| the next step is another public input process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13500)|
| 3:45:03| and the Development Corporation will have another public input process with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13503)|
| 3:45:09| that will be more site-specific, more fact-driven about how will it be laid out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13509)|
| 3:45:15| what will the lighting look like, how will the drainage be handled, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13515)|
| 3:45:20| One of the biggest issues that was discussed in the previous rezoning effort was wastewater treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13520)|
| 3:45:26| and at that time we did not have the capability to deal with wastewater from the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13526)|
| 3:45:34| in any manner other than an on-site wastewater treatment facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13534)|
| 3:45:38| And there was particular concern expressed about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13538)|
| 3:45:41| particularly given the karst soil, which is permeable, and the closed depressions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13541)|
| 3:45:46| which could link to other waterways, in particular concerns expressed about the Holston River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13546)|
| 3:45:52| In this case, the Development Corporation has committed, and KUB has committed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13552)|
| 3:45:57| that there will not be an on-site wastewater treatment facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13557)|
| 3:46:02| All of the wastewater from the site, if the development is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13562)|
| 3:46:06| will be transferred to the East Bridge Wastewater Treatment Plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13566)|
| 3:46:11| It's currently operating at a capacity of, I think, approximately 300,000 gallons per day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13571)|
| 3:46:17| and has a capacity of 1,300,000 gallons per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13577)|
| 3:46:22| Julia Childers from KUB is here to address it if you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13582)|
| 3:46:27| But since the last effort and since the sector plan, KUB has determined that it is feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13587)|
| 3:46:33| to extend the wastewater treatment system to that property to transport wastewater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13593)|
| 3:46:40| to East Bridge and to treat it at that plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13600)|
| 3:46:43| A significant change in the circumstances affecting the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13603)|
| 3:46:49| Just to briefly review the requirements for a sector plan amendment, a sector plan is required by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13609)|
| 3:46:56| You're required to adopt a general plan, which you do, and then you amend through sector plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13616)|
| 3:47:03| The conditions that warrant an amendment to the general plan or to a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13623)|
| 3:47:08| are introduction of significant new roads or utilities that were not anticipated in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13628)|
| 3:47:14| and that make development more feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13634)|
| 3:47:16| Well, that has certainly happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13636)|
| 3:47:19| The electrical capability for this site is a huge multiple of what it was before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13639)|
| 3:47:27| and there's detailed information, but both KUB and TVA have constructed large facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13647)|
| 3:47:35| in the last three years immediately adjacent to this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13655)|
| 3:47:39| The extension of the sewer facility is a major change in utilities servicing the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13659)|
| 3:47:45| Water was already, prior to 2010, improved, so potable water, wastewater treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13665)|
| 3:47:53| and electrical are all available to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13673)|
| 3:47:57| As part of the process and as part of this plan zone, we anticipate that road improvements will be required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13677)|
| 3:48:03| and we anticipate that the development corporation will make those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13683)|
| 3:48:06| That was not previously anticipated, so there have been significant changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13686)|
| 3:48:12| MPC, another basis for amending is an obvious or significant error in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13692)|
| 3:48:18| As Mr. Green noted, MPC considers that it was a mistake in the 2010 plan not to include reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13698)|
| 3:48:26| to the business park studies that identified this as a potential business park site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13706)|
| 3:48:32| particularly given the adjacency to a major interstate exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13712)|
| 3:48:37| The third basis is changes in government policy, such as a decision to concentrate development in certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13717)|
| 3:48:44| This board sets policy for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13724)|
| 3:48:47| The county commission and the mayor are where the policy comes from that drives our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13727)|
| 3:48:53| and what you have done as a group is to approve development at every interstate exchange in Knoxville but this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13733)|
| 3:49:01| You've recognized the importance of transportation and of use of those sites available adjacent to the interchanges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13741)|
| 3:49:09| and this is the last interchange that has not been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13749)|
| 3:49:14| You've also voted substantial funds for educational facilities in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13754)|
| 3:49:18| many of which are directed toward job training and job creation with significant county expenditures in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13758)|
| 3:49:29| Those are the basis on sector plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13769)|
| 3:49:32| We'd like to, if this is approved, address the zoning issues when that item comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13772)|
| 3:49:39| but there are similar requirements, change circumstances being the one that really drives it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13779)|
| 3:49:45| There have been a number of expressions of opposition from the community, and you'll undoubtedly hear more tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13785)|
| 3:49:52| We would like to put to rest a couple of items that have been circulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13792)|
| 3:49:58| One is that the development corporation currently owns approximately 290 acres of development sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13798)|
| 3:50:05| Approximately half of that is in the East Bridge business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13805)|
| 3:50:09| East Bridge is a good park for some types of businesses and not for others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13809)|
| 3:50:13| and that's why it's important to have a variety of business park sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13813)|
| 3:50:18| East Bridge does not have the interstate access that this one at Midway Road would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13818)|
| 3:50:26| but there's approximately 290 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13826)|
| 3:50:28| The development corporation does not have 750 acres of business sites available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13828)|
| 3:50:34| In fact, since the 2010 sector plan, the number of acres available for businesses has dropped significantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13834)|
| 3:50:41| and that's a driving factor in this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13841)|
| 3:50:45| There have never been any discussions concerning the sale of the property to Pilot Flying J for construction of a truck stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13845)|
| 3:50:53| A truck stop is not permitted in the EC Employment Center zone that the development corporation is requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13853)|
| 3:51:01| The project will not cost $100 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13861)|
| 3:51:05| The development corporation has invested approximately $9 million in the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13865)|
| 3:51:10| and total development cost would be about $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13870)|
| 3:51:15| KUV does not discharge toxic waste from any of its facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13875)|
| 3:51:20| and it will not discharge toxic waste from the East Bridge Wastewater Treatment Plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13880)|
| 3:51:26| The development corporation, KUV, Knox County are all subject to federal regulations regarding those discharges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13886)|
| 3:51:34| They're closely monitored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13894)|
| 3:51:35| They will be in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13895)|
| 3:51:37| Knox County has its own regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13897)|
| 3:51:39| The state of Tennessee has its own regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13899)|
| 3:51:42| This is not a problem at other business parks, and it won't be a problem at this business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13902)|
| 3:51:47| It certainly will not be a problem from the KUV plants, which KUV goes to great lengths to ensure compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13907)|
| 3:51:56| The East Bridge plant has never or has not had any permit violations in over 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13916)|
| 3:52:03| We monitor nearly 6,000 parameters at that plant to ensure that the discharge water quality complies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13923)|
| 3:52:12| The bottom line of this is that the development corporation and Knox County need business sites for our economy to continue to grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13932)|
| 3:52:21| for people to continue to have jobs and better jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13941)|
| 3:52:25| We need places for businesses to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13945)|
| 3:52:27| There's been much success in recent years, many announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13947)|
| 3:52:31| To keep that up, we need sites for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13951)|
| 3:52:34| The question is, is this site suitable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13954)|
| 3:52:36| The legal questions to you are, are there changed circumstances that justify a sector plan amendment for this site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13956)|
| 3:52:45| We believe there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13965)|
| 3:52:46| We think the record that we filed with you indicates that, and we hope you'll support the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13966)|
| 3:52:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13972)|
| 3:52:54| Thank you, Mr. McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13974)|
| 3:52:58| Keep your seat, Mr. Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13978)|
| 3:53:00| The starting time was 8.35, and it's now 8.55, so that's been 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13980)|
| 3:53:07| Speaking to opposing the sector plan change, who wishes to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13987)|
| 3:53:14| Will that be Mr. Jason Long, the attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=13994)|
| 3:53:21| Jason Long, attorney, would you give your address, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14001)|
| 3:53:25| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14005)|
| 3:53:26| Jason Long with Lowe, Yeager & Brown, 900 South Gay Street, 2102, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14006)|
| 3:53:33| Actually, I would like to request that the commission first permit me to allow our expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14013)|
| 3:53:40| Ms. Terry Brown, to speak to this issue, and then I will follow after her if that's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14020)|
| 3:53:46| That is most appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14026)|
| 3:53:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14028)|
| 3:53:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14030)|
| 3:53:56| I will say that Ms. Brown has prepared a PowerPoint slide presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14036)|
| 3:54:00| that will be appearing on the screen behind you and behind me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14040)|
| 3:54:05| The materials that are being handed out to you in Section 2, or Exhibit B, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14045)|
| 3:54:11| of those materials contain her report with these slides as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14051)|
| 3:54:15| although they are not colored, so you may want to look up on the screens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14055)|
| 3:54:24| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14064)|
| 3:54:25| Terry Brown, 7521 Badgett Road, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14065)|
| 3:54:30| And I'm a karst hydrogeologist that's been here to represent the 8th District Preservation Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14070)|
| 3:54:37| and talk a little bit about the technical issues behind our serious concerns about this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14077)|
| 3:54:42| I know being commissioners from Knox County, you all know about karst,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14082)|
| 3:54:46| but just to make sure we're all working from the same piece of paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14086)|
| 3:54:50| we're talking about a landscape that's created by the dissolution of rocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14090)|
| 3:54:54| When rock dissolves out, we have a landscape that basically has a lack of surface streams on the surface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14094)|
| 3:55:01| especially in these upland areas like the proposed office park is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14101)|
| 3:55:05| And so it's predominantly drained by sinkholes, and these are directly connected to the subsurface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14105)|
| 3:55:11| and when you have an area where people are dependent on aquifers for their drinking water supplies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14111)|
| 3:55:16| this is a major concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14116)|
| 3:55:22| We have a lot of karst in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14122)|
| 3:55:23| About half of the county is underlain by limestone and dolomite, but not all karst is created equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14123)|
| 3:55:31| Some of it is definitely more intense than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14131)|
| 3:55:33| And so back in the early 1970s, this map, the Knox County karst map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14133)|
| 3:55:40| it's areas with abundant sinkholes in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14140)|
| 3:55:43| was created by the U.S. Geological Survey specifically for municipal planning purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14143)|
| 3:55:49| and it was about the time that I-40 was being constructed through the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14149)|
| 3:55:54| And so you'll see the blue bands are basically the limestone and dolomite formations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14154)|
| 3:56:00| that are basically running from southwest to northeast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14160)|
| 3:56:04| which represents the regional trend of the rock in the Appalachians, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14164)|
| 3:56:10| But there are stippled areas that represent these more intense areas are basically sinkhole plains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14170)|
| 3:56:18| where there's really intense karst development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14178)|
| 3:56:20| and one of those is the Midway Business Park area there in Thorn Grove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14180)|
| 3:56:26| So one of the best examples of how the topography reflects the underlying geography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14186)|
| 3:56:35| is you can visualize on this KGIS hill shape map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14195)|
| 3:56:40| And so you can see in the upper right-hand corner there's a line of depressions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14200)|
| 3:56:46| those dark sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14206)|
| 3:56:48| There are more sinkholes on the left-hand side of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14208)|
| 3:56:51| and this is all running along the geologic strike from southwest to northeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14211)|
| 3:56:55| Then you have some linear features, such as this canyon-type feature going to the northwest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14215)|
| 3:57:02| and those are representing joints in the rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14222)|
| 3:57:04| And so they basically line right up with the geologic structure of the rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14224)|
| 3:57:08| So now I throw the approximate site boundaries on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14228)|
| 3:57:11| The linear sinkholes outlined in pink are the funnel-type, really deep, steep-sided sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14231)|
| 3:57:18| The sinkholes outlined in red are more basin-like, flat-type sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14238)|
| 3:57:23| and they make up a considerable part of this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14243)|
| 3:57:28| And so if we look at what those sinkholes might look like in a schematic diagram,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14248)|
| 3:57:32| you can see that the steep-sided sinkholes that were circled in the pinkish-purple color| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14252)|
| 3:57:36| are basically directly connected to the bedrock in the underlying karst system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14256)|
| 3:57:42| The more flat-lined sinkholes that have that 6% lesser grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14262)|
| 3:57:46| they're basically buried funnel-type sinkholes that are covered with deep soils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14266)|
| 3:57:51| And so each of these types of sinkholes are present on this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14271)|
| 3:57:55| and they're all connected to the subsurface in different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14275)|
| 3:57:58| And so they can be reactivated once construction starts on a site like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14278)|
| 3:58:03| and you start having hydrologic modifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14283)|
| 3:58:05| moving water around, moving soil around, things changing the subsurface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14285)|
| 3:58:09| And it's unknown how that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14289)|
| 3:58:13| This slope map I know you all have seen before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14293)|
| 3:58:15| but we have concerns about how this site is being represented as being a relatively flat site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14295)|
| 3:58:21| And so I got the GIS guys to basically color it in with the dark areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14301)|
| 3:58:26| being the areas that are 6% slope or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14306)|
| 3:58:29| And everything else, light green, yellow, orange-red, just gets even steeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14309)|
| 3:58:36| And even using a rough calculation based on the contour lines that they gave me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14316)|
| 3:58:41| I get about 115 feet of relief from the top of the ridge to Worthington Road there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14321)|
| 3:58:47| and that's significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14327)|
| 3:58:48| That is not a relatively flat site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14328)|
| 3:58:53| So we're concerned that this particular site, being on a broad ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14333)|
| 3:58:59| is a recharge area for the local aquifers in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14339)|
| 3:59:02| It has not been mapped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14342)|
| 3:59:04| We don't know which way the water flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14344)|
| 3:59:06| It's all drained internally to these sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14346)|
| 3:59:08| and there are no surface water bodies leaving the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14348)|
| 3:59:12| So it's really like throwing a dart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14352)|
| 3:59:15| If you're going to try to design a site without knowing who's going to be impacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14355)|
| 3:59:19| which water supplies in which part, it could be in any one of four directions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14359)|
| 3:59:24| in terms of where this water is going, and that's a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14364)|
| 3:59:28| If we look at the drainage maps, if we look at the watershed basin maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14368)|
| 3:59:33| so the site boundaries approximately are outlined in orange there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14373)|
| 3:59:36| and then you have in the dark black, I think they're supposed to be purple lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14376)|
| 3:59:41| are the sub-watersheds, and you've got the western part of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14381)|
| 3:59:46| going to Manifold Branch, which drains to the French Broad River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14386)|
| 3:59:50| The center part of the site may be going to, what's the name of that creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14390)|
| 3:59:57| What's the name of the creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14397)|
| 3:59:58| Lyons Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14398)|
| 3:59:59| Lyons? No, the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14399)|
| 4:00:01| That's the T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14401)|
| 4:00:03| Tuckahoe Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14403)|
| 4:00:04| I never can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14404)|
| 4:00:05| People want to call it Tuckaleechee Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14405)|
| 4:00:06| It's Tuckahoe Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14406)|
| 4:00:08| It also goes to the French Broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14408)|
| 4:00:11| And then you've got the Lyons Creek watersheds just across the other side of the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14411)|
| 4:00:17| But in reality, because we don't know where these sinkholes drain to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14417)|
| 4:00:21| these sub-watersheds have been only based on the topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14421)|
| 4:00:25| So we really don't know where any of these sinkholes go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14425)|
| 4:00:30| So is this end of the site going to the southwest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14430)|
| 4:00:33| or is it going to the northwest along that big linear feature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14433)|
| 4:00:37| Is this part of the site going to the southwest or to the south?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14437)|
| 4:00:41| Is this part of the site going along that line of sinkholes to the east, northeast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14441)|
| 4:00:47| or is it going to Carter Mill Cave, which is only a half a mile away to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14447)|
| 4:00:52| and has a significant amount of discharge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14452)|
| 4:00:54| Those are major questions that we have about the site that need to be answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14454)|
| 4:00:59| before we decide what kind of land use is going to be applied here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14459)|
| 4:01:03| And so this is just a little cartoon that can show you how these topographic watershed divides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14463)|
| 4:01:09| don't necessarily line up with groundwater basins in karst areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14469)|
| 4:01:14| So you see the ridge there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14474)|
| 4:01:16| You could draw a watershed divide across that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14476)|
| 4:01:19| but the water is sinking on each side and going to an absolutely different direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14479)|
| 4:01:25| So it's an enigma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14485)|
| 4:01:27| Karst areas are difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14487)|
| 4:01:29| They can be figured out with enough hydrogeologic investigation and enough forethought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14489)|
| 4:01:34| And we have a long history in Knox County of dealing with stormwater issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14494)|
| 4:01:38| sometimes good and sometimes in a bad way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14498)|
| 4:01:41| Contaminant transport is an issue, despite what people say may or may not happen on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14501)|
| 4:01:47| There are truck accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14507)|
| 4:01:49| There are spills and leaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14509)|
| 4:01:51| And, you know, I hate to bring up bad memories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14511)|
| 4:01:55| but remember the Koster Shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14515)|
| 4:01:57| You know, that was a contaminated debris and soil pile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14517)|
| 4:02:01| that was used as fill material in a sinkhole in the Burnett's Creek area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14521)|
| 4:02:05| It's the same band of rock, exactly the same band of rock, that this site is located in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14525)|
| 4:02:13| And it's basically an illustration of how fast water can travel in the subsurface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14533)|
| 4:02:19| Sinkhole collapse is not only likely, it's almost inevitable at this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14539)|
| 4:02:24| due to the network of sinkholes and the connectivity of the subsurface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14544)|
| 4:02:28| And we just feel like rezoning at this point without the proper knowledge of the subsurface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14548)|
| 4:02:35| is placing an undue risk on the local population who depends on water supplies there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14555)|
| 4:02:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14560)|
| 4:02:45| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14565)|
| 4:02:48| Of course, I'll defer to any questions that the commission may have for Ms. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14568)|
| 4:02:53| If there are none, I'll continue with my presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14573)|
| 4:02:59| I'd like to state that there is at least one point tonight that Mr. McAdams and I are going to agree on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14579)|
| 4:03:04| and that's the legal standard by which this commission can look at changes to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14584)|
| 4:03:10| And I believe he's correct, or I agree with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14590)|
| 4:03:14| that changed circumstances to a site can justify a change to the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14594)|
| 4:03:20| and where we would disagree, at least with respect to this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14600)|
| 4:03:24| is that those changed circumstances need to be material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14604)|
| 4:03:28| I'd like to refer the commission to the materials that we've submitted, and in particular Exhibit A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14608)|
| 4:03:37| and that is a statement from the 1995 East Knox County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14617)|
| 4:03:43| And if you look on page three of those materials, there's a section highlighted there in yellow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14623)|
| 4:03:50| and I'll read to you what the sector plan used to say about this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14630)|
| 4:03:56| We're talking about the precise location that we're dealing with in this proposed resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14636)|
| 4:04:03| Many parts of the sector contain sinkholes, solution channels, and caverns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14643)|
| 4:04:08| These formations are especially concentrated in the Thorn Grove area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14648)|
| 4:04:13| between Interstate 40 and Asheville Highway and immediately south of the Holston River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14653)|
| 4:04:18| Intensive land development, such as industrial plants and uses which could impact groundwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14658)|
| 4:04:24| are not usually suited to such terrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14664)|
| 4:04:28| Now that was a statement from the 1995 sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14668)|
| 4:04:31| It does not appear in the current sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14671)|
| 4:04:35| We don't know when it went away or why particularly it went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14675)|
| 4:04:39| No statement has been made as to why this is no longer a concern for this particular parcel of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14679)|
| 4:04:47| We would suggest that changes in circumstances should impact the topography or the geology of the region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14687)|
| 4:04:55| to address these concerns before a decision is made to change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14695)|
| 4:05:02| So the change circumstances need to be material and not simply arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14702)|
| 4:05:07| My clients are here opposing this particular development for two reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14707)|
| 4:05:12| or this particular change of sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14712)|
| 4:05:14| One, they believe this is the wrong concept for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14714)|
| 4:05:17| And two, they believe it's important that citizens have a meaningful opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14717)|
| 4:05:22| to express their voice in the planning for a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14722)|
| 4:05:27| As to the issue of wrong concept, Ms. Brown has explained to you the geography of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14727)|
| 4:05:33| And I've read to you what the NPC, or what the 1995 sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14733)|
| 4:05:38| nothing about the geography has changed in the last 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14738)|
| 4:05:41| If anything, we'd suggest that it's less stable for the development of heavy commercial or industrial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14741)|
| 4:05:50| Moreover, as pointed out by Ms. Brown, there are very few portions of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14750)|
| 4:05:56| which would meet the NPC guidelines of 6% slope or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14756)|
| 4:06:00| which is required for large tracts of land if you're looking at a BP designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14760)|
| 4:06:11| In addition, as explained by Ms. Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14771)|
| 4:06:15| there are potentially dangerous effects of the development of this property at this site as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14775)|
| 4:06:21| NPC has suggested that when fully developed, we'd be looking at 1,600 truck trips per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14781)|
| 4:06:27| We'd be looking at construction and industry and manufacturing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14787)|
| 4:06:31| and all those things that are permitted by an EC zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14791)|
| 4:06:35| There is no doubt that there's a potential for pollution of ground wells in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14795)|
| 4:06:41| And this area is somewhat unique, not only due to its topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14801)|
| 4:06:45| but also the fact that a large number of residents in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14805)|
| 4:06:49| depend upon their own private wells for drinking water, for farming, for gardening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14809)|
| 4:06:54| and for other activities, whether it be raising cattle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14814)|
| 4:06:57| or the many other rural activities that go on in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14817)|
| 4:07:01| The issue of how these ground wells could be contaminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14821)|
| 4:07:06| or whether they may be contaminated was not addressed in the expert studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14826)|
| 4:07:11| that have been submitted by the applicant to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14831)|
| 4:07:14| Those studies are limited to those water resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14834)|
| 4:07:18| over which the EPA or the state of Tennessee may have jurisdiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14838)|
| 4:07:22| but do not address the concerns of the local residents as to their private water wells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14842)|
| 4:07:28| And this touches upon the second issue that I want to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14848)|
| 4:07:32| with respect to my client's concerns over this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14852)|
| 4:07:35| and that is a meaningful participation in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14855)|
| 4:07:38| Yes, several meetings have been held regarding this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14858)|
| 4:07:43| and yes, discussions have been had for several years over potential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14863)|
| 4:07:48| And in fact, the residents in this area, many of them, thought the issue was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14868)|
| 4:07:53| It not only had been defeated in the courts when the original change took place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14873)|
| 4:07:59| but it also came before this commission and was not approved at that time subsequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14879)|
| 4:08:06| The residents of the area were initially under the impression that the issue had been resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14886)|
| 4:08:11| and that development would not take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14891)|
| 4:08:14| When these meetings subsequent, the bus tour and the dinner meetings took place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14894)|
| 4:08:19| reservations were expressed about the groundwater wells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14899)|
| 4:08:23| and what would happen with respect to the karst formations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14903)|
| 4:08:27| and the potential contamination of those groundwater wells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14907)|
| 4:08:31| I think it is significant that there's no mention of those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14911)|
| 4:08:36| in the report that was submitted by the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14916)|
| 4:08:38| or in the recommendations of MPC at this stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14918)|
| 4:08:41| Those are issues important to the local residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14921)|
| 4:08:44| that they do not feel have been addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14924)|
| 4:08:46| and of course they'll have an opportunity to speak shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14926)|
| 4:08:51| Additionally, this is the wrong development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14931)|
| 4:08:53| because it's out of character with the surrounding neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14933)|
| 4:08:58| The land in this area is largely zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14938)|
| 4:09:01| There is a commercial parcel, but it's significant to note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14941)|
| 4:09:04| that the only thing that has been developed on that parcel are billboard signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14944)|
| 4:09:10| There has been no further commercial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14950)|
| 4:09:12| and I think that speaks volumes to the topography of this region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14952)|
| 4:09:16| and the wisdom of economically developing this particular land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14956)|
| 4:09:21| that no private developers have stepped in in the dozens of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14961)|
| 4:09:26| that property has been zoned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14966)|
| 4:09:28| to try to develop property off the interstate for a commercial purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14968)|
| 4:09:37| And finally, well, not finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14977)|
| 4:09:40| but we would suggest that this is not the right development for this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14980)|
| 4:09:44| because it won't accomplish the stated objectives of the development corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14984)|
| 4:09:49| in seeking to build a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14989)|
| 4:09:52| As has been stated and as was referenced by Mr. McAdam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14992)|
| 4:09:55| there are other business parks in the area located within five miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14995)|
| 4:09:59| You have Forks of the River and you have the East Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=14999)|
| 4:10:02| Those are unfilled business parks at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15002)|
| 4:10:05| and perhaps a portion of that reason is that they're located off the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15005)|
| 4:10:10| Perhaps a portion of that reason is they're located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15010)|
| 4:10:12| in a very rural agricultural area of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15012)|
| 4:10:16| and we don't need further business parks in East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15016)|
| 4:10:20| The numbers that were submitted by the development corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15020)|
| 4:10:23| showing a growing population for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15023)|
| 4:10:26| to justify a change in circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15026)|
| 4:10:30| don't specifically deal with a growing or decreasing population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15030)|
| 4:10:34| out in East Knox County, at least not since 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15034)|
| 4:10:38| And I would suggest that when you look at what substantial changes have occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15038)|
| 4:10:43| you have to look post-2010 when the last East County sector plan was put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15043)|
| 4:10:50| and when this property was not at that time designated as BP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15050)|
| 4:10:56| In short, there's not any evidence in this record that I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15056)|
| 4:11:00| that would show that a business park would enjoy the type of success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15060)|
| 4:11:04| that the development corp is seeking approval from this commission to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15064)|
| 4:11:10| Without some firm or proof of a potential for success for this business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15070)|
| 4:11:14| it would be imprudent at this time to develop it for that purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15074)|
| 4:11:18| especially when, as has been stated by Ms. Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15078)|
| 4:11:22| there are not large swaths of land that can be dedicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15082)|
| 4:11:27| because of the slope on this property to single businesses coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15087)|
| 4:11:31| We're talking about several small tracts of plant land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15091)|
| 4:11:34| rather than large tracts that are preferred for business park development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15094)|
| 4:11:40| As to the other change conditions that have been cited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15100)|
| 4:11:44| we reference those in our materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15104)|
| 4:11:46| I'm not going to take up your time with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15106)|
| 4:11:48| other than to say that the changes must be substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15108)|
| 4:11:52| or the changes must be material to the zoning of the property itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15112)|
| 4:11:58| In our opinion, they should have taken place post-2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15118)|
| 4:12:05| In short, we think there's not a sufficient basis for amending the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15125)|
| 4:12:09| Certainly, we don't believe that the development of business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15129)|
| 4:12:12| based upon the evidence that's presented to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15132)|
| 4:12:14| would promote the public health, safety, and welfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15134)|
| 4:12:17| as is required under a change to the zoning laws or to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15137)|
| 4:12:22| As to our second point to oppose this particular development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15142)|
| 4:12:27| we believe it's important for the citizens to have a voice in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15147)|
| 4:12:31| When a sector plan is put in place, when the general plan is put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15151)|
| 4:12:35| they should have the ability to rely upon it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15155)|
| 4:12:37| in absence of significant change circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15157)|
| 4:12:40| Certainly, if this body can set governmental policy, which it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15160)|
| 4:12:45| and that governmental policy can in and of itself be a basis to change a sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15165)|
| 4:12:50| then there really is no purpose to having the sector plans in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15170)|
| 4:12:54| at least for the security of the residents in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15174)|
| 4:12:57| They depend upon these sector plans, they have input in that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15177)|
| 4:13:00| and they want to know that their input is being heard, being listened to, and being relied upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15180)|
| 4:13:06| Finally, I'll say that I understand EC is a less restrictive zoning in the sense that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15186)|
| 4:13:17| or a more coordinated zoning in the sense that it requires the submission of site plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15197)|
| 4:13:24| specific plans, prior to further development of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15204)|
| 4:13:27| However, to go forward with the rezoning at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15207)|
| 4:13:31| we still believe is imprudent on its face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15211)|
| 4:13:34| And I'd like to refer to the statements from MPC Commissioner Cain when this matter was before MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15214)|
| 4:13:42| He stated, we have no tools in place currently that essentially will help maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15222)|
| 4:13:47| the rural residential character of this area outside of the business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15227)|
| 4:13:51| Once this business park is approved, if it's approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15231)|
| 4:13:55| then there will be all kinds of justifications for sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15235)|
| 4:14:00| And he, of course, means sector plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15240)|
| 4:14:02| The point being that we don't have enough information at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15242)|
| 4:14:06| to guarantee that a business park could succeed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15246)|
| 4:14:09| or even to suggest that one could succeed without further study and investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15249)|
| 4:14:14| And if this commission goes forward and changes the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15254)|
| 4:14:18| to then rely upon the development corporation to come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15258)|
| 4:14:21| with additional information to show the potential for success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15261)|
| 4:14:24| in the meantime, there are going to be properties in the East Knox County area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15264)|
| 4:14:28| which may be subject to rezoning just as a result of the BP designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15268)|
| 4:14:33| being placed upon this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15273)|
| 4:14:36| We think that's a step too far, and this commission should require further investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15276)|
| 4:14:42| and study as to the potential for success of this business park before going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15282)|
| 4:14:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15286)|
| 4:14:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15287)|
| 4:14:51| Thank you, Mr. Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15291)|
| 4:14:54| Commencing at 8.56 and 9.17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15294)|
| 4:14:59| You're right on the minute with the development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15299)|
| 4:15:04| Does the development corporation wish to speak again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15304)|
| 4:15:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Tom McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15314)|
| 4:15:16| Only to say that we recognize, as with any development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15316)|
| 4:15:20| there are challenges to the development of a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15320)|
| 4:15:23| The success of the park will ultimately depend on how well it can be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15323)|
| 4:15:29| The development corporation has done this in many locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15329)|
| 4:15:32| It engages engineers and other professionals to address the very issues that were mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15332)|
| 4:15:39| and those will be discussed as part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15339)|
| 4:15:41| The development corporation is convinced it can be a successful business park site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15341)|
| 4:15:46| and that there has been substantial change in that area and in the county generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15346)|
| 4:15:51| that support the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15351)|
| 4:15:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15353)|
| 4:15:54| Mr. Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15354)|
| 4:15:59| Only to make sure I submitted the materials for commissioners to review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15359)|
| 4:16:03| but I want to make sure they're made a part of the record as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15363)|
| 4:16:06| the letter and supplements that I attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15366)|
| 4:16:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15370)|
| 4:16:12| The clerk has that information as passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15372)|
| 4:16:17| We will now look at the list of those who have asked to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15377)|
| 4:16:22| and we will begin with former Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15382)|
| 4:16:40| Name and address for the record, please, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15400)|
| 4:16:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15402)|
| 4:16:43| Mark Harmon, 1714 North Hills Boulevard, Knoxville 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15403)|
| 4:16:49| As you've suggested, I suppose on this Dickens of a long agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15409)|
| 4:16:53| I am the ghost of commissions past, and from that commission past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15413)|
| 4:16:59| I remind you that although we've heard a lot of talk about changed circumstance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15419)|
| 4:17:04| what we really have is just one more disrespecting the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15424)|
| 4:17:09| and the same old circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15429)|
| 4:17:12| We have substantial community opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15432)|
| 4:17:14| That hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15434)|
| 4:17:16| We have slope and runoff issues with local waterways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15436)|
| 4:17:18| Not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15438)|
| 4:17:20| We have millions in costs for extending sewage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15440)|
| 4:17:22| It's not out there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15442)|
| 4:17:24| We have green space and sprawl issues, and we have karst geology and sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15444)|
| 4:17:28| That's all been presented to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15448)|
| 4:17:30| We do not dwell on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15450)|
| 4:17:32| We also have a second ghost, if you will, the ghost of failed business parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15452)|
| 4:17:38| Take a look at Tommy Shumpert Park, now a recreational park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15458)|
| 4:17:41| attempted to be a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15461)|
| 4:17:44| These half-empty business parks are a testament to the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15464)|
| 4:17:46| that sometimes we just don't get this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15466)|
| 4:17:49| and here may be a case where we definitely don't have it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15469)|
| 4:17:52| and we're not respecting past decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15472)|
| 4:17:55| This was rushed past so quickly that a court had to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15475)|
| 4:17:59| no, you followed wrong procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15479)|
| 4:18:01| And then when we voted against it again and respected the will of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15481)|
| 4:18:07| now the development corporation comes back for a second, third, or fourth bite at the apple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15487)|
| 4:18:11| It's disrespectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15491)|
| 4:18:13| And these half-empty business parks are testament to that failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15493)|
| 4:18:17| We have 95 acres at Hardin, 82 at Pellissippi, 150 in Eastbridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15497)|
| 4:18:21| More importantly, we also have lots of non-business park opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15501)|
| 4:18:25| such as many of the industrial and business-owned areas along Interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15505)|
| 4:18:28| such as the Cherry Street exit off I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15508)|
| 4:18:31| And the final of the three ghosts that we face today are the ghosts of missed opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15511)|
| 4:18:38| I know you want to see money come out of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15518)|
| 4:18:41| I know you don't want to see the county's purchase of it go to waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15521)|
| 4:18:44| And I've actually presented to each of you a missed opportunity that we're not talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15524)|
| 4:18:49| which is a better use of this property, which I believe is agritourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15529)|
| 4:18:53| We can do that within the existing zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15533)|
| 4:18:57| And think about how that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15537)|
| 4:18:59| Now, you might scoff at the idea of agritourism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15539)|
| 4:19:02| but think about it in terms of this particular statistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15542)|
| 4:19:06| Claiborne County alone decided to push geotourism and agritourism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15546)|
| 4:19:11| and added its uptick in tourism to $17 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15551)|
| 4:19:16| Our state has been committed to agritourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15556)|
| 4:19:19| In the very first year we pushed agritourism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15559)|
| 4:19:22| it added $17 million to our economy and brought in 3 million visitors a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15562)|
| 4:19:27| We're talking about things like harvest festivals, hayrides, mazes, farm tours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15567)|
| 4:19:32| petting zoos, hiking and horseback riding, historical reenactments, bird watching, stargazing, bed and breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15572)|
| 4:19:37| These tourist-operated farms often directly market fresh food to consumers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15577)|
| 4:19:42| and create their own ciders, jams, jellies, preserves, beef jerky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15582)|
| 4:19:47| Think about where Midway Road is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15587)|
| 4:19:49| It's right out there in that tourist zone and adding to tourists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15589)|
| 4:19:54| So the kids want to go with dad to the amusement park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15594)|
| 4:19:58| but mom would like to spend a day out at a real farm and take one of the kids with her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15598)|
| 4:20:03| and they have a great experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15603)|
| 4:20:05| That's the kind of opportunity we can prevent there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15605)|
| 4:20:08| And by doing agritourism, what we're talking about is more effectively using the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15608)|
| 4:20:13| something that makes sense for the use of this land, this landscape, the water underneath it, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15613)|
| 4:20:18| It just fits better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15618)|
| 4:20:20| Think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15620)|
| 4:20:21| We can send this back to development corporations and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15621)|
| 4:20:23| you haven't properly considered this really good land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15623)|
| 4:20:26| And the agri portion of agritourism gives you the idea that this really is a better option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15626)|
| 4:20:30| Not only do you get property taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15630)|
| 4:20:32| but you'll get sales taxes from people who buy stuff at agritourist facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15632)|
| 4:20:37| Need I remind you, this is something that as politicians we all understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15637)|
| 4:20:43| Sales taxes on tourists, taxes on people who can't vote against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15643)|
| 4:20:49| Those are the best types, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15649)|
| 4:20:53| But even beyond that little silly point about how we raise taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15653)|
| 4:20:57| let's look at the very serious point about land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15657)|
| 4:21:00| That is what we do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15660)|
| 4:21:01| We make land use choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15661)|
| 4:21:03| I've been in the seats you've been in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15663)|
| 4:21:05| I sat there right beside Sam and Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15665)|
| 4:21:08| And Randy, you'll have to talk to Tony about those times when we got really distracted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15668)|
| 4:21:13| and started playing lumpy bingo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15673)|
| 4:21:16| But by and large, we listen and we make decisions about land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15676)|
| 4:21:21| Here is an opportunity to create an alternate use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15681)|
| 4:21:24| one that doesn't bring in these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15684)|
| 4:21:27| And if we have some business park opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15687)|
| 4:21:29| we still have plenty of space and non-business park space to put them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15689)|
| 4:21:33| The wiser alternative, the less intrusive alternative I present to you is an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15693)|
| 4:21:38| I present this to you as a reason to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15698)|
| 4:21:40| no, you've had enough shots at trying to make this a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15700)|
| 4:21:43| Let's look at a more reasonable, better opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15703)|
| 4:21:46| and let that be agritourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15706)|
| 4:21:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15708)|

| 4:22:13| I'd like to yield my time to my friend and neighbor, Ed Reed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15733)|
| 4:22:17| I think he's going to speak some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15737)|
| 4:22:21| He's my neighbor, my friend in our historic neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15741)|
| 4:22:24| of which I restore some of the old buildings there, history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15744)|
| 4:22:33| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15753)|
| 4:22:35| My name is Ed Reed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15755)|
| 4:22:36| I live at 435 Southeast End Road in Strawberry Plains, Tennessee, 37871.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15756)|
| 4:22:42| Our home is approximately one mile from the interchange of the Midway Road exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15762)|
| 4:22:45| It's our exit that we use on a regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15765)|
| 4:22:48| and our families lived in the area for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15768)|
| 4:22:51| I might say also that my mother and my wife's both of her parents are in Thorn Grove Cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15771)|
| 4:22:56| and so we've got a lot of deep roots in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15776)|
| 4:22:59| I'm standing to express my concern and to speak against the TDC's plan for business park at Exit 402.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15779)|
| 4:23:07| I attended the MPC meeting on November 12, and I was quite shocked at what I discovered there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15787)|
| 4:23:15| I'm going to actually tell you that the application that was presented by the law firm, by TDC's law firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15795)|
| 4:23:23| had many false statements that were apparently understood by the majority of the MPC members as being true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15803)|
| 4:23:30| And so since I've said that, I will tell you what I feel is a false statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15810)|
| 4:23:34| First of all, the TDC's quest for rezoning changes in the Midway Road area contained an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15814)|
| 4:23:41| and supporting documents that were 83 pages long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15821)|
| 4:23:45| They were not numbered sequentially, as several different documents were put together in support for the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15825)|
| 4:23:51| But I numbered them and have them in my book here, and likely most of you have them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15831)|
| 4:23:56| so I'm just going to refer to the pages that I put, knowing that they are in the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15836)|
| 4:24:01| And I'm just going to tell you seven of them right now, real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15841)|
| 4:24:04| There are false and misleading statements to induce the MPC to seek the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15844)|
| 4:24:10| First one, the land at Midway Road is relatively flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15850)|
| 4:24:13| That's already been addressed, but to say that is an intentional misrepresentation of material facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15853)|
| 4:24:20| The second one, roads in the area have been substantially improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15860)|
| 4:24:23| These are quotes from their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15863)|
| 4:24:25| This was on page 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15865)|
| 4:24:27| Actually, Midway Road, Kodak Road, Thorngrove Pike were specifically mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15867)|
| 4:24:30| as having substantial improvements since the last TDC application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15870)|
| 4:24:35| Just as a little bit of history, the Midway Road portion of I-40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15875)|
| 4:24:39| along with three other sections in East Tennessee, were completed in December of 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15879)|
| 4:24:44| Governor Winfield Dunn flew in the state helicopter from Nashville over and landed on the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15884)|
| 4:24:49| to open this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15889)|
| 4:24:51| Many of you probably remember that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15891)|
| 4:24:53| That was 41 years ago this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15893)|
| 4:24:56| Since that time, no improvements have been made to the rural roads at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15896)|
| 4:25:01| Midway Road is not a through road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15901)|
| 4:25:03| It's only about two-tenths of a mile north of the exit at Dead Ends and Thorngrove Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15903)|
| 4:25:07| which is another narrow 20-foot wide road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15907)|
| 4:25:10| The supporting documentation provided by the Development Corporation states that the intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15910)|
| 4:25:14| that support Business Park should have major arterial roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15914)|
| 4:25:19| To state that the roads at Midway Road have been substantially improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15919)|
| 4:25:22| is another intentional misrepresentation of material fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15922)|
| 4:25:26| No changes have occurred at all in 41 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15926)|
| 4:25:30| The third point that I find quite disturbing is development proposal is compatible with community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15930)|
| 4:25:35| because substantial changes have taken place in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15935)|
| 4:25:39| In reality, no business of any kind exists at the exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15939)|
| 4:25:43| A truck terminal truck stop, which has just been denied as having to take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15943)|
| 4:25:48| but in the document itself, their document on page four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15948)|
| 4:25:51| it says there would be 1,600 trucks using the exit every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15951)|
| 4:25:55| and 33,000 cars exiting the exit every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15955)|
| 4:25:59| Why would they stop? 33,000 cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15959)|
| 4:26:02| It's incompatible. It's about as incompatible as one could think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15962)|
| 4:26:06| The supporting documentation also provided by TDC states that Business Park should avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15966)|
| 4:26:11| adjacent low-density residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15971)|
| 4:26:14| So that's, of course, a conflict there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15974)|
| 4:26:17| No road changes, no improvements, no businesses of any kind have occurred at the Midway Road exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15977)|
| 4:26:22| As a matter of fact, there are no traffic lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15982)|
| 4:26:24| There are not even street lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15984)|
| 4:26:26| If you were to go out there today, the only lights you would see is your headlights of your car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15986)|
| 4:26:30| The only change that we have been able to observe is the electrical substation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15990)|
| 4:26:33| that now serves the Kodak community better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15993)|
| 4:26:36| Listen carefully. Public sewer is still miles away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=15996)|
| 4:26:41| To say that there have been substantial changes to the exit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16001)|
| 4:26:44| is another intentional misinterpretation of a material fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16004)|
| 4:26:48| Now here's another one that came up in their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16008)|
| 4:26:51| They state since a portion of the land at Midway is Zone C4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16011)|
| 4:26:55| the area will change whether we go forward with the business park or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16015)|
| 4:26:59| It has not changed in over 40 years and would not change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16019)|
| 4:27:02| unless the county spends millions of dollars to the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16022)|
| 4:27:06| The TDC application states that KUB will not provide sewage to the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16026)|
| 4:27:10| unless the VP is developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16030)|
| 4:27:13| In order to state the area will be developed anyway does not change the utility situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16033)|
| 4:27:17| or improve the land from solid rock, sinkholes, and drainage area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16037)|
| 4:27:21| This is another intentional misrepresentation of material fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16041)|
| 4:27:25| The fifth point, and I'm on page four of my document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16045)|
| 4:27:28| is the Midway Road is one of the top three busiest exits on I-40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16048)|
| 4:27:33| on Interstate 40 East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16053)|
| 4:27:35| There are only three exits. It's going to be in the top no matter what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16055)|
| 4:27:40| Nashville Highway 394, Strawberry Plains 398, and Midway Road 402.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16060)|
| 4:27:45| So Midway Road is going to be in the top no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16065)|
| 4:27:48| There has not been a noticeable increase in traffic at Midway exit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16068)|
| 4:27:51| in spite of what they've stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16071)|
| 4:27:53| Very few through travelers exit at Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16073)|
| 4:27:56| There are no services there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16076)|
| 4:27:58| To state that Midway Road has become one of the top three most trafficked areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16078)|
| 4:28:01| in East Knox County is simply not true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16081)|
| 4:28:04| and an intentional misrepresentation of material facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16084)|
| 4:28:08| Page number six, the nearest interchange is at Strawberry Plains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16088)|
| 4:28:12| and they state it is fully developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16092)|
| 4:28:15| The fact is that of yesterday, the fact is of today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16095)|
| 4:28:20| there are three large tracts of land with frontage on Strawberry Plains Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16100)|
| 4:28:24| available for sale and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16104)|
| 4:28:26| On the south side of the exit, there is a 36.5-acre tract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16106)|
| 4:28:30| another 9.5-acre tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16110)|
| 4:28:32| On the north side, there's a 60-acre tract available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16112)|
| 4:28:35| a total on that site right now on the market of 106 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16115)|
| 4:28:39| All infrastructure is in place with no additional cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16119)|
| 4:28:42| to the taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16122)|
| 4:28:44| Based on Knox County's zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16124)|
| 4:28:46| a business park must have a minimum of five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16126)|
| 4:28:49| Using the criteria, that criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16129)|
| 4:28:52| there could now be an additional 21 business parks at Strawberry Plains exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16132)|
| 4:28:56| Accordingly, to say that the nearest exit to Midway Road is fully developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16136)|
| 4:29:01| is yet another intentional misrepresentation of material fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16141)|
| 4:29:05| And the final one that I will mention is as stated again from the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16145)|
| 4:29:10| page 20, as of 2010, 0% of East Knox County population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16150)|
| 4:29:15| reported farming as an occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16155)|
| 4:29:17| The fact there are many farmers in East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16157)|
| 4:29:19| Farmers raise cattle, make hay, plant crops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16159)|
| 4:29:22| There are large farm operations that use Midway Road exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16162)|
| 4:29:25| A large cattle ranch joins my property on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16165)|
| 4:29:28| To indicate the area is changing and there are no farms there is simply not true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16168)|
| 4:29:32| and an intentional misinterpretation or misrepresentation of material fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16172)|
| 4:29:38| There are a lot of people here tonight opposing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16178)|
| 4:29:40| They're just here for our support, but there would be many more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16180)|
| 4:29:42| except they thought it was settled nine years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16182)|
| 4:29:45| And then the other group feels that there's nothing that can be done about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16185)|
| 4:29:48| Due to time constraints, I'm not going to mention the 12 reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16188)|
| 4:29:50| why I think it should not be there except for number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16190)|
| 4:29:54| And that's on page 7, my last page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16194)|
| 4:29:57| A travel center truck stop is not needed at Midway Road for the traveling public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16197)|
| 4:30:01| There's already a travel center truck stop four miles away at Strawberry Plains Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16201)|
| 4:30:05| There's another travel center truck stop 10 miles east at 312 Deep Springs Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16205)|
| 4:30:10| And just 33 miles away at exit 369, Watt Road is the largest truck stop in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16210)|
| 4:30:16| Now I'm going to close with this little statement that I put here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16216)|
| 4:30:18| Don't think the project's gone too far to stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16218)|
| 4:30:21| Remember the Bridge to Nowhere, the project in 2005 in Ketchikan, Alaska?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16221)|
| 4:30:26| U.S. Senator Ted Stevens proposed in the U.S. Congress that funding be made available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16226)|
| 4:30:30| to build a bridge across the Inside Passage through Gravina Island.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16230)|
| 4:30:34| He was able to get an earmark for the $398 million project through Congress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16234)|
| 4:30:39| However, when the taxpayers of America heard of this pork barrel spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16239)|
| 4:30:42| they raised such a response that the project was defunded by Congress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16242)|
| 4:30:46| even after much money had been expended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16246)|
| 4:30:48| So let's not put good money after bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16248)|
| 4:30:51| And finally, I will say thank you very much for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16251)|
| 4:30:54| And now that you are more familiar with the facts surrounding the Midway Road Exchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16254)|
| 4:30:58| I urge you to deny the rezoning request of the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16258)|
| 4:31:02| regarding Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16262)|
| 4:31:03| And thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16263)|
| 4:31:14| Bob Wolfenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16274)|
| 4:31:19| Bob Wolfenbarger, 8416 Kodak Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16279)|
| 4:31:22| Appreciate you all staying late, bearing with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16282)|
| 4:31:27| This is about the fifth time I've been up here before you discussing Midway Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16287)|
| 4:31:31| in the last 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16291)|
| 4:31:32| And as everybody said, circumstances haven't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16292)|
| 4:31:37| Back in 2000, a lot of us came to a meeting at Carter High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16297)|
| 4:31:41| and started a sector plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16301)|
| 4:31:44| And we spent the summer, about nine meetings, get to the end of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16304)|
| 4:31:50| and myself and another community leader got pulled aside by the lead planner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16310)|
| 4:31:56| and shared with us that the Development Corporation was planning to include a concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16316)|
| 4:32:00| for an industrial park at Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16320)|
| 4:32:04| And, of course, we were stunned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16324)|
| 4:32:08| They haven't been at the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16328)|
| 4:32:09| They haven't had anything to discuss with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16329)|
| 4:32:12| They're just going to add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16332)|
| 4:32:14| And the plan was going to draft stage, and so they stuck it on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16334)|
| 4:32:19| And we hired an attorney, spent about five more weeks negotiating with MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16339)|
| 4:32:24| and they removed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16344)|
| 4:32:26| All this happened about the same time that that component of the 95 sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16346)|
| 4:32:33| that Jason read to you disappeared from the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16353)|
| 4:32:38| There's oversight on our part to let that happen, but it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16358)|
| 4:32:42| But it didn't change the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16362)|
| 4:32:43| The facts are that the previous MPC staff was very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16363)|
| 4:32:50| They saw the geological maps, and they were aware that this site is not suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16370)|
| 4:32:55| I'm not sure that Ms. Brown pointed it out as clearly as I would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16375)|
| 4:33:01| but she did share with me this is an exceptionally more than normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16381)|
| 4:33:07| for Knox County karst area, and it has far more sinkholes than average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16387)|
| 4:33:12| You want to shake your head to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16392)|
| 4:33:14| And with that said, we get on through the sector plan, and we get past it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16394)|
| 4:33:20| MPC agrees to remove the sector plan from the 2000 sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16400)|
| 4:33:24| remove the developed business part from the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16404)|
| 4:33:28| And as a community, we thought it was over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16408)|
| 4:33:30| We trusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16410)|
| 4:33:32| You know, we thought it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16412)|
| 4:33:34| Then 2006 rolls around, and these guys pop up again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16414)|
| 4:33:37| and they're going to tell us that it's a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16417)|
| 4:33:40| And we mustered our troops and tried to have a conversation and couldn't get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16420)|
| 4:33:47| Once again, we had to hire an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16427)|
| 4:33:50| And as you all know Mr. Boock, all know him very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16430)|
| 4:33:54| He represented us well, and I think Mr. McAdams has explained how it went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16434)|
| 4:34:00| And then in 2008 and 2009, MPC together with the Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16440)|
| 4:34:06| decided they were going to amend the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16446)|
| 4:34:09| and include a business part in that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16449)|
| 4:34:14| Then they were going to engage in a process that nobody had ever done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16454)|
| 4:34:17| And at that point, I'd done three sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16457)|
| 4:34:19| and they were going to engage a countywide survey to influence the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16459)|
| 4:34:25| And we opposed that and pushed and pushed and pushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16465)|
| 4:34:29| Next thing you know, it's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16469)|
| 4:34:33| And then in 2010, right about the same time that Judge Fansler ruled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16473)|
| 4:34:39| we came back to county commission, and you guys supported us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16479)|
| 4:34:43| and removed it from the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16483)|
| 4:34:46| So then 2012 rolls around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16486)|
| 4:34:49| And once again, the Development Corporation tried to slide one in on the side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16489)|
| 4:34:56| and came to you all and asked you to approve a tax incentive for K-Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16496)|
| 4:35:03| And, of course, the K-Tom people were playing the Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16503)|
| 4:35:07| and the Development Corporation was playing us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16507)|
| 4:35:09| And what happened was is that K-Tom got a better deal on some variables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16509)|
| 4:35:13| so that went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16513)|
| 4:35:17| And here we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16517)|
| 4:35:19| We're back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16519)|
| 4:35:21| You know, this is something that's happened to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16521)|
| 4:35:24| that shouldn't happen to any community in a democratic society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16524)|
| 4:35:27| We have been abused emotionally and financially trying to do the right thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16527)|
| 4:35:34| We have known as farmers and as people that have lived off the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16534)|
| 4:35:38| my family's been there for 200 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16538)|
| 4:35:40| we've known that there's something odd about this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16540)|
| 4:35:44| In all the years, I'm 60 years old and I grew up around this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16544)|
| 4:35:47| there's never been anything done on that site except hay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16547)|
| 4:35:52| Most farmers don't run their cattle on the major portion of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16552)|
| 4:35:56| because of the sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16556)|
| 4:35:58| And it's never been tilled in my lifetime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16558)|
| 4:36:01| because it has soil deposits sometimes that are six or eight inches deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16561)|
| 4:36:05| Maybe somewhere they're 25 feet deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16565)|
| 4:36:09| But it's so unreliable, when you plow it, the ground sinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16569)|
| 4:36:14| It goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16574)|
| 4:36:16| So what I would ask you to do is consider the turmoil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16576)|
| 4:36:19| consider the controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16579)|
| 4:36:21| There's a reason for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16581)|
| 4:36:23| And there's another reason that that property has not been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16583)|
| 4:36:26| Private developers know what the development corporation should have known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16586)|
| 4:36:29| and what the sector's plans in the past have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16589)|
| 4:36:32| This site is not suitable for this kind of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16592)|
| 4:36:36| We as a community are begging you, let's be done with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16596)|
| 4:36:40| Say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16600)|
| 4:36:42| Let us find another way to get the county out of this mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16602)|
| 4:36:45| We will work with conservation groups and the USDA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16605)|
| 4:36:50| and try to get your money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16610)|
| 4:36:53| And let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16613)|
| 4:36:55| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16615)|
| 4:36:58| Vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16618)|
| 4:37:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16620)|
| 4:37:07| Mark Crockett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16627)|
| 4:37:16| My name is Mark Crockett, 7801 Kodak Road, Riverdale, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16636)|
| 4:37:22| I've heard it said several times that this is a NIMBY issue, not in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16642)|
| 4:37:30| And to some extent, that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16650)|
| 4:37:33| My backyard is not too far from this proposed business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16653)|
| 4:37:38| But I have a slightly different take on the not in my backyard point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16658)|
| 4:37:43| If you would please, if you take a look at the map on the wall here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16663)|
| 4:37:47| between the Holston River and the French Broad River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16667)|
| 4:37:50| that's the area we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16670)|
| 4:37:52| We're talking about a region of Knox County that is unspoiled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16672)|
| 4:37:56| It's a place you can go and ride your bike and not see an industrial park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16676)|
| 4:38:00| not see a condo complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16680)|
| 4:38:04| You can float the French Broad River, you can float the Holston River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16684)|
| 4:38:08| and you see pristine pastures and farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16688)|
| 4:38:12| My point is that that region of Knox County is our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16692)|
| 4:38:16| That's Knox County's backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16696)|
| 4:38:19| We don't need an industrial park there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16699)|
| 4:38:22| We need to maintain that backyard for what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16702)|
| 4:38:26| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16706)|
| 4:38:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16707)|
| 4:38:35| Elaine Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16715)|
| 4:38:48| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16728)|
| 4:38:49| My name is Elaine Clark, 8003 Thorn Grove Pike, Knoxville 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16729)|
| 4:38:55| I represent the French Broad Preservation Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16735)|
| 4:38:58| an organization whose mission is to protect, preserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16738)|
| 4:39:02| and enhance the rural agriculture and historic character of the French Broad River corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16742)|
| 4:39:07| and its surrounding communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16747)|
| 4:39:10| It is with great pride that the FBPA and others have been active in this mission for over 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16750)|
| 4:39:17| This is the last rural agricultural area in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16757)|
| 4:39:21| and to date continues to support viable farming operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16761)|
| 4:39:25| that contribute to our overall economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16765)|
| 4:39:29| This area has a firm sense of place with multiple generations of families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16769)|
| 4:39:34| well-rooted in the rural community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16774)|
| 4:39:37| This area is also home to over 20 significant historic structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16777)|
| 4:39:42| that are listed and are eligible for the National Historic Register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16782)|
| 4:39:46| The archaeological significance has been studied by the State of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16786)|
| 4:39:50| and the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16790)|
| 4:39:52| Native Americans established settlements dating back 12,000 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16792)|
| 4:39:57| and qualify for National Historic Registration as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16797)|
| 4:40:01| The river itself holds its own significance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16801)|
| 4:40:05| First and foremost, the French Broad provides a significant portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16805)|
| 4:40:09| of the drinking water to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16809)|
| 4:40:12| The upper French Broad River is a state historic river in North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16812)|
| 4:40:16| The lower French Broad watershed has tributaries like Tuckahoe Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16816)|
| 4:40:21| that are under the state scenic river program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16821)|
| 4:40:24| The river, its tributary creeks, and the lands in this corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16824)|
| 4:40:28| are home to nine rare species listed by the State of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16828)|
| 4:40:32| and 12 species listed by the federal government as in danger of extinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16832)|
| 4:40:39| These are some of the reasons the citizens of East Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16839)|
| 4:40:42| have remained opposed to development that is insensitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16842)|
| 4:40:46| to the protection of these vital resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16846)|
| 4:40:50| With these factors in mind, it is imperative that we work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16850)|
| 4:40:54| in establishing new protections for this river corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16854)|
| 4:40:58| and its surrounding communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16858)|
| 4:41:01| The community has requested funding from Mayor Burchett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16861)|
| 4:41:04| for the implementation of the French Broad River Corridor Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16864)|
| 4:41:08| Turning this study into a small community plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16868)|
| 4:41:11| as part of the East County Sector Plan will provide these needed protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16871)|
| 4:41:16| The mayor has agreed to fund this implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16876)|
| 4:41:19| and MPC Director Green will begin the process in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16879)|
| 4:41:24| Help us protect these important resources that will enhance economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16884)|
| 4:41:29| in Knox County just as other communities like Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16889)|
| 4:41:33| have proven to be successful in economic development, growth, and quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16893)|
| 4:41:40| The FBPA is definitely opposed to the Midway Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16900)|
| 4:41:45| However, you have a resolution before you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16905)|
| 4:41:48| that is requesting amending the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16908)|
| 4:41:51| If that is approved, we are asking for your help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16911)|
| 4:41:54| and we want to request that County Commission adopt this plan implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16914)|
| 4:41:59| into this resolution before you so you can continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16919)|
| 4:42:03| to protect this vital area for Knox County for future generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16923)|
| 4:42:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and fellow commissioners, for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16927)|
| 4:42:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16931)|
| 4:42:16| Ms. Clark, the next name, is it Mike Loveday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16936)|
| 4:42:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16944)|
| 4:42:48| Mike Loveday, 1815 Midway Road, Strawberry Plains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16968)|
| 4:42:53| 37871.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16973)|
| 4:43:00| I'm here concerned about the runoff, the stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16980)|
| 4:43:11| My home is actually, I guess, two miles south of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=16991)|
| 4:43:21| The waterway that runs underneath I-40 on Midway Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17001)|
| 4:43:26| if you follow Midway, it runs right beside of it to my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17006)|
| 4:43:31| Limestone Creek that comes in the other direction, it runs to my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17011)|
| 4:43:43| My grandparents bought the place in 1942, so the history of the place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17023)|
| 4:43:50| none of the buildings have been touched by the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17030)|
| 4:43:57| But my belief is if this construction is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17037)|
| 4:44:02| there's an immediate threat to my property and at least six other homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17042)|
| 4:44:12| So I just hope you take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17052)|
| 4:44:14| I don't know what you guys plan when you build things like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17054)|
| 4:44:19| how you're going to control this water, but it is, it's a major threat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17059)|
| 4:44:25| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17065)|
| 4:44:27| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17067)|

| 4:44:37| Dale Lawton, 6227 Norwood Drive, Knoxville, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17077)|
| 4:44:42| My family hadn't been here for 200 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17082)|
| 4:44:44| My wife and I came to East Tennessee about 25 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17084)|
| 4:44:47| and decided this is where we wanted to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17087)|
| 4:44:50| Now, we've been on three continents, numerous foreign countries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17090)|
| 4:44:53| about 25 of these great United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17093)|
| 4:44:56| and other than about a one-week love affair with Pagosa Springs, Colorado,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17096)|
| 4:45:00| this is always where we decided to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17100)|
| 4:45:03| So about nine years ago, my son graduated from UT, got his law degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17103)|
| 4:45:09| and he owns the grandkids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17109)|
| 4:45:11| So we decided to go ahead and retire while we were still working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17111)|
| 4:45:15| And here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17115)|
| 4:45:16| We've been here about nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17116)|
| 4:45:17| And I was talking with one of my neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17117)|
| 4:45:19| and they told me about this business, this industrial park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17119)|
| 4:45:22| that's supposed to come out there on Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17122)|
| 4:45:24| I couldn't believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17124)|
| 4:45:26| It's like why would anybody that weren't right in mind want to put a business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17126)|
| 4:45:29| an industrial park, whatever kind of park you want to call this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17129)|
| 4:45:32| out here in this spot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17132)|
| 4:45:34| It was just crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17134)|
| 4:45:35| Then I heard about how it happened, you know, the subversive tactics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17135)|
| 4:45:38| and we're hearing about all that today about how the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17138)|
| 4:45:40| the development corporation bought the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17140)|
| 4:45:43| and kind of snuck around their neighbors and all this kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17143)|
| 4:45:46| It's like why are we still talking about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17146)|
| 4:45:49| Why are we still talking about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17149)|
| 4:45:51| I mean, it's nine years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17151)|
| 4:45:54| Like Mr. Wolfenbarger said, we've been through this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17154)|
| 4:45:56| How many times have the residents of East Knox County got to be put through this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17156)|
| 4:46:00| before you guys come and say enough is enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17160)|
| 4:46:03| Enough is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17163)|
| 4:46:05| Vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17165)|
| 4:46:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17166)|
| 4:46:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17168)|
| 4:46:09| Frank Haskers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17169)|
| 4:46:14| Frank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17174)|
| 4:46:19| Zacharias.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17179)|
| 4:46:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17184)|
| 4:46:27| Frank Zacharias with a T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17187)|
| 4:46:30| Frank Zacharias, 1001 Smith School Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17190)|
| 4:46:35| actually Strawberry Plains, 37871 for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17195)|
| 4:46:42| Thank you, Chairman, for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17202)|
| 4:46:45| I'm a new resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17205)|
| 4:46:47| My wife and I just acquired a farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17207)|
| 4:46:50| It's the old Sherrod and Flynn Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17210)|
| 4:46:56| About 250 acres close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17216)|
| 4:46:59| We did this in hopes to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17219)|
| 4:47:02| Now, again, new to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17222)|
| 4:47:08| I attended these two meetings I think that were discussed here for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17228)|
| 4:47:16| and even a third meeting to discuss positives and negatives regarding the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17236)|
| 4:47:22| and the zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17242)|
| 4:47:25| These meetings were intended, and again, this is my objective review of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17245)|
| 4:47:30| because I'm new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17250)|
| 4:47:32| I'm just trying to understand some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17252)|
| 4:47:35| So these meetings were intended to gain community input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17255)|
| 4:47:39| and it was stated again tonight to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17259)|
| 4:47:41| So what happened to this community input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17261)|
| 4:47:45| How were the concerns addressed and how was that shared with the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17265)|
| 4:47:53| So let's talk about my concern and the reason I'm speaking tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17273)|
| 4:47:57| because they didn't really expect me to come forward being a new guy on the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17277)|
| 4:48:04| My concern is the protection of the aquifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17284)|
| 4:48:07| My concern, our concern, is the protection of the wells, the drinking water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17287)|
| 4:48:16| for all the people in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17296)|
| 4:48:24| Groundwater intrusion and contaminants are significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17304)|
| 4:48:28| can be significant to affecting the lives of people in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17308)|
| 4:48:34| From these meetings, it became clear to me that the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17314)|
| 4:48:38| and this commission may be making a zoning decision on minimal facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17318)|
| 4:48:43| And let me give you some examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17323)|
| 4:48:45| We heard about the sinkholes in the area that will present significant challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17325)|
| 4:48:53| through construction and groundwater and wastewater control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17333)|
| 4:49:00| We also heard there was significant vacant acreage available at Strawberry Plains exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17340)|
| 4:49:09| So why is there a push, again, to eliminate farmland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17349)|
| 4:49:14| and potentially challenge and contaminate wells and drinking water or the aquifer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17354)|
| 4:49:23| No apparent technical studies such as dye tests, core drilling tests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17363)|
| 4:49:29| those kinds of things have been completed to determine factually the suitability of this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17369)|
| 4:49:36| as an industrial park or a potential industrial park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17376)|
| 4:49:39| that the community is very much opposed to from what I've heard at all these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17379)|
| 4:49:45| Lastly, as a person new to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17385)|
| 4:49:48| and a relative objective observer to these development meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17388)|
| 4:49:51| it's amazing to me that a decision is being brought to a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17391)|
| 4:49:57| based on an apparent lack of technical land facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17397)|
| 4:50:02| with an apparent political motive to utilize this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17402)|
| 4:50:08| Since this investment was made about 10 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17408)|
| 4:50:13| you've heard from several different people about some potential alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17413)|
| 4:50:20| We heard one of the ex-commissioners actually provided some alternative solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17420)|
| 4:50:27| You have those before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17427)|
| 4:50:30| Now a little bit about my background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17430)|
| 4:50:34| I have a doctorate in radiological engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17434)|
| 4:50:38| I did some work out at Oak Ridge National Laboratories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17438)|
| 4:50:42| and saw and monitored wells, wells that had been contaminated during the Cold War| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17442)|
| 4:50:51| and even the 1940s when they were developing nuclear tests, nuclear bombs back in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17451)|
| 4:51:00| Again, we also had the situation at Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17460)|
| 4:51:05| that affected the groundwater from some of the non-radiological contaminants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17465)|
| 4:51:12| which are still causing problems to those communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17472)|
| 4:51:16| I'm not suggesting that you have that kind of situation with an industrial park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17476)|
| 4:51:21| but you certainly have a potential of contaminating the wells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17481)|
| 4:51:28| through groundwater intrusion and certainly sinkholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17488)|
| 4:51:32| that you have to be concerned about when you're trying to transport wastewater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17492)|
| 4:51:39| a significant distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17499)|
| 4:51:42| Those are my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17502)|
| 4:51:44| I hope that you will at least give pause and consider alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17504)|
| 4:51:51| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17511)|
| 4:52:04| Is there anyone else that has signed up for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17524)|
| 4:52:13| Do you have a question, Mr. Reed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17533)|
| 4:52:15| Yes, I just wanted to make sure that you understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17535)|
| 4:52:17| that I would like to have my document in the record tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17537)|
| 4:52:20| I gave a copy to everyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17540)|
| 4:52:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17542)|
| 4:52:23| They have that for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17543)|
| 4:52:25| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17545)|
| 4:52:29| If there's no one else that has assumed they've signed up for public forum of this particular subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17549)|
| 4:52:39| of these eight or ten people that have spoken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17559)|
| 4:52:44| one of the questions that was raised, and I need to clarify this with Mayor Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17564)|
| 4:52:51| if I could please, that the work or study around this proposed site and on the French Broad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17571)|
| 4:53:04| are you going to be presenting to county commission requests for $50,000 in the next budget year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17584)|
| 4:53:16| And the reason I ask that question is because I do not want to see the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17596)|
| 4:53:21| Mr. Green, go out and make an expenditure and then let's not be on board with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17601)|
| 4:53:27| Tim Burchett, 501 Princeton Court, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17607)|
| 4:53:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17611)|
| 4:53:32| I've talked to Gerald about that, and that is what we're planning on doing, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17612)|
| 4:53:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17618)|
| 4:53:39| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17619)|
| 4:53:42| The time is 9.56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17622)|
| 4:53:46| We need to take a break, and we'll resume at 10.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17626)|
| 4:53:52| I'd like to pause this for just a second to say that we've mixed and matched several things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17632)|
| 4:54:00| as we've proceeded along here over how long we've been discussing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17640)|
| 4:54:05| and speaking of, in general terms, things that are related to the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17645)|
| 4:54:12| and other items that are related to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17652)|
| 4:54:17| I've allowed that to occur because with both items, the sector plan change and zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17657)|
| 4:54:26| sort of being discussed together, then hopefully we'll have a better understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17666)|
| 4:54:31| as we move on through where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17671)|
| 4:54:34| We are through the introduction of public comment, and based on those public comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17674)|
| 4:54:42| I would allow the applicant time to speak if the applicant wishes to talk about what has occurred during public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17682)|
| 4:54:57| Mr. McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17697)|
| 4:54:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17698)|
| 4:54:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17699)|
| 4:55:00| We would just like to briefly respond to a couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17700)|
| 4:55:04| You heard a lot of statements about geologic conditions on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17704)|
| 4:55:10| and about the development potential of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17710)|
| 4:55:12| The Development Corporation has engaged licensed professional engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17712)|
| 4:55:16| who have surveyed the site very carefully and have conducted over 45 borings on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17716)|
| 4:55:22| geotechnical borings, to determine whether the site could be developed as a business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17722)|
| 4:55:28| and the engineers have confirmed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17728)|
| 4:55:30| Mike Stomer with S&ME is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17730)|
| 4:55:33| If you have any questions about that at all, he'd be happy to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17733)|
| 4:55:37| One of the other significant comments you heard related to the impact of this proposed development on water in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17737)|
| 4:55:47| One of the engineers on the project is Brent Johnson with Vaughan & Melton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17747)|
| 4:55:52| who for many years was with the city engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17752)|
| 4:55:55| and is an expert in stormwater drainage and runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17755)|
| 4:55:59| and we'd like to ask Mr. Johnson to make a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17759)|
| 4:56:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17763)|
| 4:56:05| Thank you all. I know it's getting late, so I'll try to be really, really brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17765)|
| 4:56:10| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17770)|
| 4:56:11| As Mr. McAdams said, I'm Brent Johnson at 1909 Ayler Avenue, Knoxville 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17771)|
| 4:56:18| I was with the city of Knoxville for over 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17778)|
| 4:56:22| and I was the city's first stormwater engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17782)|
| 4:56:25| So we've looked at this real closely, and I promise you that at this stage in my career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17785)|
| 4:56:31| I'm not going to design or propose anything that's going to contaminate the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17791)|
| 4:56:37| That's just not going to happen based on our design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17797)|
| 4:56:40| And some of the ways we're going to do that, we're very sensitive to the sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17800)|
| 4:56:44| and we're not planning to use the sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17804)|
| 4:56:47| There's going to be a belt and suspenders approach, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17807)|
| 4:56:50| First of all, we're going to take the overall site plan, the master plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17810)|
| 4:56:54| and consider that impervious area, and we're going to treat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17814)|
| 4:56:58| We're going to treat that in such a way that it exceeds the Knox County regulations by far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17818)|
| 4:57:03| Additionally, I heard some talk about steep slopes and sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17823)|
| 4:57:07| We are going to set aside 55 acres so that we don't disturb the steepest slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17827)|
| 4:57:13| and that we do preserve and protect the sinkholes based on regulations as they are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17833)|
| 4:57:21| Some of the things that we'll be using, again, we'll be using detention ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17841)|
| 4:57:27| Again, not directing anything toward the subsurface any more so than it naturally falls and flows today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17847)|
| 4:57:34| We will be using grassline ditches and those type of soft controls in order to treat our stormwater quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17854)|
| 4:57:43| Quantity, the regulations require that it be no more post-development than it was pre-development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17863)|
| 4:57:49| and we will actually make sure that we will adhere to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17869)|
| 4:57:54| That's one approach. That's just our approach for the master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17874)|
| 4:57:57| In addition to that, every developable site or every development that comes on and develops their individual site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17877)|
| 4:58:04| will also have to comply with those Knox County rules for water quantity and water quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17884)|
| 4:58:10| I want to say one more thing and then I'll close briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17890)|
| 4:58:14| but I was around the city and helped them clean up Coster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17894)|
| 4:58:19| Coster was a Superfund site where somebody intentionally dug something up and took it and dumped it in a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17899)|
| 4:58:28| We are not doing that. We are going to propose to protect the sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17908)|
| 4:58:32| We're not going to dump anything in them, and we're not on a Superfund site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17912)|
| 4:58:36| So there's a lot of difference in those characterizations as well as Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17916)|
| 4:58:42| This isn't Oak Ridge out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17922)|
| 4:58:44| We're not going to have things, industry and manufacturing of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17924)|
| 4:58:49| And then the last thing that I'll say briefly is that, you know, in my expert opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17929)|
| 4:58:56| if I am downstream of this and I have a well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17936)|
| 4:59:00| I am much happier having treated stormwater coming toward my well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17940)|
| 4:59:06| than I am wastewater from septic systems every time something flushes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17946)|
| 4:59:10| Additionally, I heard a lot of talk about farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17950)|
| 4:59:14| Farm runoff is the number two pollutant in the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17954)|
| 4:59:18| All the fecal from the farm waste as well as the pesticides and the herbicides used for a farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17958)|
| 4:59:25| So all that to say, we're talking about surface water runoff that's well treated versus some existing conditions today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17965)|
| 4:59:34| And in my expert opinion, I would feel much safer with the runoff we are proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17974)|
| 4:59:40| than the runoff that currently exists today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17980)|
| 4:59:42| And I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17982)|
| 4:59:45| Mr. Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17985)|
| 4:59:56| Just briefly in response to the last comments, I don't think anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=17996)|
| 5:00:02| I don't think it's the intention of the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18002)|
| 5:00:04| and I don't think anyone can guarantee the safety of the stormwater runoff in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18004)|
| 5:00:10| They can't guarantee that these wells won't be polluted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18010)|
| 5:00:15| It can't be done because the necessary testing to even know how that groundwater flows has not occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18015)|
| 5:00:21| These are the type of issues that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18021)|
| 5:00:23| And when we look at the studies that have been referenced and undertaken by the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18023)|
| 5:00:29| I'm referring to the site feasibility study performed on July 25, 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18029)|
| 5:00:35| Those studies are only concerned with jurisdictional streams and wetlands, as quoted in the study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18035)|
| 5:00:42| not with private wells that are owned by the residents who have vocalized their opposition continuously to this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18042)|
| 5:00:49| and who have expressed their very serious concerns about the preservation of those water resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18049)|
| 5:00:56| Furthermore, that same study advises that stripping, grubbing, demolition operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18056)|
| 5:01:02| and other required excavations may be necessary to reach subgrade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18062)|
| 5:01:07| And even after all that, subsequent structural soil fill may be necessary to prepare the site for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18067)|
| 5:01:15| The point being, this is a difficult piece of property to prepare for this type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18075)|
| 5:01:22| I think everyone will agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18082)|
| 5:01:25| And we would suggest that it's not an ideal piece of property for the proposed construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18085)|
| 5:01:31| for the proposed plan that is there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18091)|
| 5:01:35| And that study goes on to note that even after such substantial operations have taken place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18095)|
| 5:01:41| quote, there is some inherent risk associated with building on any site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18101)|
| 5:01:46| underlain by formations containing carbonate rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18106)|
| 5:01:49| If sinkhole conditions are encountered, the type of corrective action should be determined by S&ME| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18109)|
| 5:01:56| during subgrade construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18116)|
| 5:01:58| The point being that there are always concerns when dealing with sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18118)|
| 5:02:04| when dealing with this particular type of karst formation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18124)|
| 5:02:08| As Ms. Brown pointed out, they're elevated in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18128)|
| 5:02:12| because this particular piece of property is not your common Knox County karst formation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18132)|
| 5:02:18| It's intensified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18138)|
| 5:02:20| And that's why the residents believe that it's an inappropriate area for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18140)|
| 5:02:25| The Foundation Systems Engineering PC study noted that with respect to future sinkhole activity that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18145)|
| 5:02:35| quote, this risk is real and can be increased due to construction-related activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18155)|
| 5:02:42| Again, these are the applicants' own experts acknowledging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18162)|
| 5:02:45| there are some very real risks in going forward with these developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18165)|
| 5:02:50| And then finally, in the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18170)|
| 5:02:54| it was noted by the experts that the movement of groundwater is assumed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18174)|
| 5:02:59| in approximately the same direction as the dip of the natural topographic map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18179)|
| 5:03:04| I think this is where our experts actually would disagree on this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18184)|
| 5:03:10| and we can ask Ms. Brown if necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18190)|
| 5:03:12| to actually explain to the Commission that when you're dealing with sinkholes and karst formations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18192)|
| 5:03:17| that what goes on on the surface isn't necessarily what goes on underneath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18197)|
| 5:03:23| Those are the points I wanted to bring out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18203)|
| 5:03:25| This site is recognized as difficult by both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18205)|
| 5:03:30| The opposition to the application would simply point out that additional study can be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18210)|
| 5:03:35| to determine how feasible this project really is before we take the next significant step of rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18215)|
| 5:03:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18222)|
| 5:03:43| Or changing the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18223)|
| 5:03:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18224)|
| 5:03:49| Thank you, Mr. Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18229)|
| 5:03:51| As you stated, whether this be rezoning or whether this be the changing the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18231)|
| 5:03:58| I need to back up for just a second and say that where have we been all this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18238)|
| 5:04:04| We've been at this for 6, 8, 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18244)|
| 5:04:07| Since 2006, it's almost like all of this predates us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18247)|
| 5:04:12| and it does not mean that something that happened in years gone by make it stay like it is forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18252)|
| 5:04:26| If I look back on my being on Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18266)|
| 5:04:31| I think I've pushed for everything from let's get away from the mulch facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18271)|
| 5:04:37| which was not going to bring us any money, but I went to the auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18277)|
| 5:04:40| It brought $1.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18280)|
| 5:04:42| Or we were going to do something with Beverly Park Place, as it's now referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18282)|
| 5:04:48| a dollar a year and never made any money out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18288)|
| 5:04:53| But we pushed on that for another year, and it raised significant dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18293)|
| 5:04:57| and is the most improved health care facility in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18297)|
| 5:05:02| Continuing on down the road, that's Tazewell Pike headed north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18302)|
| 5:05:06| The Knox County Convenience Center was moved across the road and closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18306)|
| 5:05:11| The county sent out another piece of property there for 2 1⁄2, 3 more years saying it was leased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18311)|
| 5:05:17| and we no longer sat on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18317)|
| 5:05:20| Well, KGIS said it was Knox County, and it was sold at auction for $22,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18320)|
| 5:05:27| The only reason I say any of that is because whether it be rural high school or Oakwood School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18327)|
| 5:05:34| or this piece of property, 345 acres at Midway Road, it's now come to a time of I'm pushing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18334)|
| 5:05:43| It's do it or divest it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18343)|
| 5:05:46| Now, that, commissioners, is a question that's up to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18346)|
| 5:05:51| But I'm fully, well, I'm sitting in the driver's seat right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18351)|
| 5:05:58| I'm asking that we look at just one part right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18358)|
| 5:06:03| We can only look at the sector plan because that is what's now before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18363)|
| 5:06:07| If you'll remember a moment ago, I said something about we've talked a lot about zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18367)|
| 5:06:13| and the things that will handle wastewater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18373)|
| 5:06:21| Or we've talked about are we going to drill and study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18381)|
| 5:06:27| Are we going to set aside commercial space, which hasn't been talked about yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18387)|
| 5:06:34| but I've got a list of questions that go with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18394)|
| 5:06:38| But right now what we have before us is the sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18398)|
| 5:06:44| And it's not that there is a veil between us and the rest of the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18404)|
| 5:06:50| but now is the time for discussion amongst commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18410)|
| 5:06:54| to talk about where it is that we're wanting to get to and what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18414)|
| 5:06:59| So we're right at the moment open for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18419)|
| 5:07:02| And I do see a light from Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18422)|
| 5:07:11| I don't know where to start here, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18431)|
| 5:07:14| Over the years, some of us have been around a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18434)|
| 5:07:16| We've seen a lot of changes and a lot of changes in ways to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18436)|
| 5:07:21| When I was a kid looking at Buck Rogers comic books, I never thought man would fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18441)|
| 5:07:28| Some of you all remember Kaz Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18448)|
| 5:07:31| The building sitting right here, according to Kaz Walker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18451)|
| 5:07:33| should have been 300 feet underground by now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18453)|
| 5:07:37| We've learned to deal with these projects over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18457)|
| 5:07:41| and learned how to deal with them effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18461)|
| 5:07:45| As the General from Stormwater mentioned, they've done some core drilling there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18465)|
| 5:07:51| They know what they're getting into, and I feel confident that whatever they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18471)|
| 5:07:57| they're going to do it in the right way or else you're all going to be back up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18477)|
| 5:08:00| or in court against them for not doing it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18480)|
| 5:08:03| So we've got a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18483)|
| 5:08:08| We're in the discussion phase right at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18488)|
| 5:08:11| I'll make a motion if we can get through discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18491)|
| 5:08:14| I can make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18494)|
| 5:08:15| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18495)|
| 5:08:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18504)|
| 5:08:25| I guess I'm a little confused as to what sounded like you wanted us to limit the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18505)|
| 5:08:32| which is extremely hard to do because we've kind of had it, as you said earlier, all thrown at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18512)|
| 5:08:37| So, you know, a lot of my questions may be on either side, zoning or a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18517)|
| 5:08:46| So I'm struggling with how to proceed, and I'll look to your guidance for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18526)|
| 5:08:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18532)|
| 5:08:54| If you'd permit me, Commissioner McKenzie, the sector plan change will be to approve or deny or send back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18534)|
| 5:09:08| Those will be our only three choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18548)|
| 5:09:10| Do you agree with me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18550)|
| 5:09:12| Yeah, yeah, I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18552)|
| 5:09:13| I just have several questions, and I don't know if, you know, it may be over on the zoning side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18553)|
| 5:09:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18561)|
| 5:09:22| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18562)|
| 5:09:23| So I'll start out with KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18563)|
| 5:09:27| If someone wants to speak for them, unless someone's still here from KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18567)|
| 5:09:34| Mr. McAdams had mentioned that it goes – there's currently a 300,000-gallon capacity –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18574)|
| 5:09:45| I mean, flow out of East Bridge, and it could take 1.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18585)|
| 5:09:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18593)|
| 5:09:56| I think that's what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18596)|
| 5:09:57| I don't know that that's the capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18597)|
| 5:10:01| Is that a true statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18601)|
| 5:10:03| I'm Julie Childers with the Knoxville Utilities Board, 4505 Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18603)|
| 5:10:10| The current capacity out at East Bridge is 1.33 million gallons a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18610)|
| 5:10:17| So far, we're used up capacity of about a third of a million gallons a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18617)|
| 5:10:22| So there's reserve capacity out there of over a million gallons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18622)|
| 5:10:26| The new development will use about another third of a million gallons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18626)|
| 5:10:30| So that will put us up to around 0.65 or so out of the total of 1.33 capacity that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18630)|
| 5:10:37| So, you know, I'll state in general, I'm getting very wishy-washy on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18637)|
| 5:10:44| And the reason being, this is one of the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18644)|
| 5:10:47| We did the same thing at Forks of the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18647)|
| 5:10:50| I guess they had a sewage treatment plant that they shut down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18650)|
| 5:10:53| and now you all are pumping that over to Loves Creek maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18653)|
| 5:10:58| It stinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18658)|
| 5:11:00| And you hadn't been able to do anything about the stink for a decade or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18660)|
| 5:11:05| I think that's about how long it's been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18665)|
| 5:11:07| And I don't know what that flow is from Forks of the River to Loves Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18667)|
| 5:11:14| but right there at the Williams Creek Golf Course, we hadn't been able to do anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18674)|
| 5:11:18| And those neighbors have lived with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18678)|
| 5:11:23| How much flow goes from Forks of the River over to Loves Creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18683)|
| 5:11:29| I'm not sure of that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18689)|
| 5:11:30| It's much greater than the flow we're talking about at East Bridge, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18690)|
| 5:11:34| What's the reason for the continued smell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18694)|
| 5:11:37| And what assurance can we have that pumping 300,000 gallons per day over three or four miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18697)|
| 5:11:46| is not going to yield that same product?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18706)|
| 5:11:49| The forest main we're talking about going up to East Bridge is shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18709)|
| 5:11:53| It's smaller in diameter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18713)|
| 5:11:55| And so the time of the wastewater in the pipe will be less, which causes less odor to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18715)|
| 5:12:02| Will we also be using chemical treatment to control the odor as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18722)|
| 5:12:07| Well, you all are doing that currently at Forks unsuccessfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18727)|
| 5:12:12| A measure better, but, you know, on a scale of 10, if we're down to a 6, it's still tough on the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18732)|
| 5:12:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18741)|
| 5:12:23| That's probably all that I have for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18743)|
| 5:12:27| So that kind of brings me to my second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18747)|
| 5:12:31| If we're not talking about as much as Forks Silver River, then I'm struggling with what are we going to be doing there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18751)|
| 5:12:42| We're only talking about something similar to what East Bridge, which it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18762)|
| 5:12:47| You're anticipating a flow similar to East Bridge, 300,000 gallons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18767)|
| 5:12:52| She said it would sound like there would be another 300,000 gallons coming from Midway over to East Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18772)|
| 5:12:58| So we're talking about doubling the sewage flow is all we're talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18778)|
| 5:13:08| And Todd, you and I talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18788)|
| 5:13:11| If I'm behind this, I'm wanting something big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18791)|
| 5:13:16| I don't, I don't, you can keep, like I told you, we can have some capacity for a move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18796)|
| 5:13:23| You can have those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18803)|
| 5:13:25| But I'm wanting something big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18805)|
| 5:13:27| And it doesn't sound like 300,000 gallons big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18807)|
| 5:13:31| And, you know, so neighbors, I do want something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18811)|
| 5:13:34| But if it's not going to be big and we can't build it, then I'm not necessarily in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18814)|
| 5:13:39| So that's another one of my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18819)|
| 5:13:42| And then just a question for SM&E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18822)|
| 5:13:45| What's the largest business plot of land can we build there with all these conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18825)|
| 5:13:54| What's the biggest thing we can do there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18834)|
| 5:13:57| What, you know, what's the rainmaker that we can bring in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18837)|
| 5:14:02| So this is a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18842)|
| 5:14:10| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18850)|
| 5:14:12| About the largest single site that we can put together out there is about 50 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18852)|
| 5:14:19| So we don't have any sites in our business parks that are currently developed now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18859)|
| 5:14:25| that are larger than 50 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18865)|
| 5:14:29| Lifetime is going in on a site that when you look at the development portion of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18869)|
| 5:14:37| I mean, they're going to go up to 500 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18877)|
| 5:14:39| Exedy America Corporation, there's 600, 700 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18879)|
| 5:14:43| So, I mean, you get pretty big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18883)|
| 5:14:45| I mean, and to judge the size, the number of employees based on wastewater flow is not really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18885)|
| 5:14:51| it's not a metric by which you can judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18891)|
| 5:14:56| Capacity is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18896)|
| 5:14:58| I mean, if you all don't know the business, you have to have capacity to have large flows or maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18898)|
| 5:15:05| So if you're only going after small flows, then that's, I think it would depend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18905)|
| 5:15:09| The flow would be dictated based on the type of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18909)|
| 5:15:12| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18912)|
| 5:15:13| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18913)|
| 5:15:14| I don't want to limit you is my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18914)|
| 5:15:16| If you're only planning a small layer diameter pipe, then you've just limited the types of businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18916)|
| 5:15:23| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18923)|
| 5:15:24| Like a food processing company is probably not going to be a target company for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18924)|
| 5:15:31| I mean, you recognize types of business parks depending on what they were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18931)|
| 5:15:35| what your utility loads are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18935)|
| 5:15:37| If you had one that had a huge power demand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18937)|
| 5:15:39| then it might not be suitable for one of the other business parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18939)|
| 5:15:42| If you've got one that's got a huge power demand and it's not got an enormous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18942)|
| 5:15:47| it's got more of your typical wastewater flow, I mean, this site, there's nothing better than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18947)|
| 5:15:52| So, you know, companies look at this all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18952)|
| 5:15:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18955)|
| 5:15:56| So with the, so what we're saying from a geotechnical standpoint, we're, I know there are no absolutes in life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18956)|
| 5:16:07| but we're darn sure, pretty darn sure that we can get a 50-acre swath out of here without depressions, sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18967)|
| 5:16:19| potential for dropouts, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18979)|
| 5:16:23| So that's, is that what we're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18983)|
| 5:16:25| We're saying that we've got a site that lays out in about 50 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18985)|
| 5:16:29| So within that, you're going to have side yards, front yards, building pads, parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18989)|
| 5:16:36| So, yeah, we can get a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18996)|
| 5:16:37| That would be the largest, but, you know, or that site might make sense that it gets developed into two 25-acre parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=18997)|
| 5:16:46| It really kind of depends on the prospect you have and what their needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19006)|
| 5:16:52| I mean, you could have a very large building that wouldn't necessarily have a lot of people in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19012)|
| 5:16:56| or you could have a smaller building that could, depending on the number of shifts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19016)|
| 5:16:59| type of operations they do, you know, if you have something that has a mix of the office of manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19019)|
| 5:17:07| So there's a lot of variables in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19027)|
| 5:17:09| They're not just, they don't necessarily, square footage doesn't necessarily completely equate to number of employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19029)|
| 5:17:17| but maybe it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19037)|
| 5:17:18| It depends on what's going on inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19038)|
| 5:17:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19040)|
| 5:17:21| You know, I just look at the history, as Commissioner Wright pointed out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19041)|
| 5:17:26| I guess we did some type of geotech study before we did the green waste facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19046)|
| 5:17:31| and they had a nice big man-made lake there that they showed up one morning and it was drained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19051)|
| 5:17:37| So I struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19057)|
| 5:17:42| Again, I walked in here for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19062)|
| 5:17:45| I'm going to be clear, and I think I've been clear to everyone, but I'm struggling here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19065)|
| 5:17:51| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19071)|
| 5:17:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19072)|
| 5:17:55| Thank you, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19075)|
| 5:17:58| Seeing no further lights, looking at this, oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19078)|
| 5:18:04| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19084)|
| 5:18:05| Well, I kind of want to talk, I mean, I spent a few years on TDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19085)|
| 5:18:09| and obviously I've been for this project from the very beginning and voted for it last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19089)|
| 5:18:15| So I think it's kind of, to talk a little bit about what Sam was talking about, capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19095)|
| 5:18:22| and, you know, there's a lot of things that have been tossed about, about Hardin Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19102)|
| 5:18:27| It was 95 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19107)|
| 5:18:29| Now it's half developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19109)|
| 5:18:32| I think there's 11 acres left in West Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19112)|
| 5:18:36| You can correct me if I'm wrong, and there's a few office buildings left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19116)|
| 5:18:41| And I think West Bridge recently last year expanded 20 or 30 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19121)|
| 5:18:49| or I can't remember how many acres it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19129)|
| 5:18:53| And so Knox County is, and there's some private land out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19133)|
| 5:18:57| Yeah, Cherry Street could use some redevelopment, but those are all in private hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19137)|
| 5:19:02| And I think it would be wise to have capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19142)|
| 5:19:08| This is not a today park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19148)|
| 5:19:10| I mean, I think we've got to, you know, this is, I keep going back to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19150)|
| 5:19:13| but what we're deciding is not for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19153)|
| 5:19:16| It's for 10, 15 years ago, or from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19156)|
| 5:19:19| And it's, we talk about, you know, we, last month or last couple months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19159)|
| 5:19:24| we talked about East Town not being a viable mall anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19164)|
| 5:19:29| Well, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19169)|
| 5:19:30| We ran Hackney out of town, and they were going out there to provide residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19170)|
| 5:19:35| or to provide jobs in East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19175)|
| 5:19:38| And Lifetime, Fresenius, the pool company, have all started to move into East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19178)|
| 5:19:45| And so that's, if we say no to more potential sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19185)|
| 5:19:50| I mean, then we can't come back and say East Town is undeveloped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19190)|
| 5:19:55| because we're leading to the jobs not being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19195)|
| 5:20:00| And so keep in mind that this is not a today decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19200)|
| 5:20:03| This is a future decision for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19203)|
| 5:20:05| This is not going to be developed in the next three or four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19205)|
| 5:20:08| and have, you know, five buildings on it, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19208)|
| 5:20:11| I mean, it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19211)|
| 5:20:12| There could be something in the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19212)|
| 5:20:13| But I think this is not a decision for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19213)|
| 5:20:15| This is a decision for the future of Knox County and our job growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19215)|
| 5:20:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19218)|
| 5:20:20| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19220)|
| 5:20:22| As I was going to say a moment ago, the problem, as I see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19222)|
| 5:20:27| that exists at Midway Road is not about whether or not we're going to break the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19227)|
| 5:20:38| because I believe there's a huge amount of regulation that's in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19238)|
| 5:20:42| that Development Corporation will have to put up with MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19242)|
| 5:20:46| and then put up with us in order to make any changes at that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19246)|
| 5:20:54| or in that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19254)|
| 5:20:59| One of the problems that I have with the current sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19259)|
| 5:21:04| is it is low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19264)|
| 5:21:11| If you look back at the $13 million or whatever was required to do sewer way back when,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19271)|
| 5:21:19| that's now been reduced to something that a developer of 250-some acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19279)|
| 5:21:25| may find an economic advantage to having that real estate and doing it with sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19285)|
| 5:21:35| And the sector plan right now says low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19295)|
| 5:21:42| And that's all we're talking about right at the moment is the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19302)|
| 5:21:46| We're not talking about zoning and all the many, many issues that I have listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19306)|
| 5:21:54| that we'll have to discuss in just a few minutes with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19314)|
| 5:22:01| So let me state what I've stated before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19321)|
| 5:22:04| It's time to do it or divest it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19324)|
| 5:22:09| If we divest it, I'm telling the community I think we have less input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19329)|
| 5:22:16| with whoever the Development Corporation may sell to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19336)|
| 5:22:20| We have a $10 million hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19340)|
| 5:22:25| And I believe that the questions that have been asked over the last year and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19345)|
| 5:22:31| a lot of them will be talked about in zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19351)|
| 5:22:34| but I believe a lot of them will have a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19354)|
| 5:22:37| which will be better than it being a bedroom community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19357)|
| 5:22:42| Right now there are 200 kids a year graduating from Carter High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19362)|
| 5:22:46| They travel three and a half miles down Carter School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19366)|
| 5:22:50| They go west 28 miles to Pellissippi Parkway to get a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19370)|
| 5:22:54| or they go east and go out of Knox County to get a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19374)|
| 5:22:59| What can be there at that interchange?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19379)|
| 5:23:01| It can be bedrooms or jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19381)|
| 5:23:06| And we have the opportunity to control the jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19386)|
| 5:23:09| and we probably do not have an opportunity to control the bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19389)|
| 5:23:14| So there are only three things in front of us right at this moment for this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19394)|
| 5:23:19| It's either to approve it as recommended by the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19399)|
| 5:23:24| deny it, or send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19404)|
| 5:23:28| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19408)|
| 5:23:29| I make a motion that it be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19409)|
| 5:23:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19412)|
| 5:23:40| I move that it be approved per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19420)|
| 5:23:43| Charlie Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19423)|
| 5:23:45| Did you get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19425)|
| 5:23:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19427)|
| 5:23:49| I just want to say, you know, you made a lot of discussion here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19429)|
| 5:23:53| and when I first ran for office I went out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19433)|
| 5:23:56| and I thought one of the biggest things I want to do is talk about development of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19436)|
| 5:24:02| And I went to a lot of different places and what I was finding out is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19442)|
| 5:24:05| we're not a very viable place to bring industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19445)|
| 5:24:09| because we have no developable land, really large tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19449)|
| 5:24:14| I think it takes, what, 1,500 acres to be a good piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19454)|
| 5:24:18| over 2,000 to be an excellent what people look for when they start relocating their companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19458)|
| 5:24:24| And many of the companies that come in here now that are being looked at are not smokestack companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19464)|
| 5:24:30| What they are is technological type businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19470)|
| 5:24:35| which you don't have putting a nut and bolt on something and then putting it out, you know, like car industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19475)|
| 5:24:41| We're not going to get a car industry here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19481)|
| 5:24:43| But we're going to get some nice high-paying jobs here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19483)|
| 5:24:46| that we've got to have the land to develop on and then we've got to have the utilities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19486)|
| 5:24:51| And I put the emphasis on KUB to take care of the facility out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19491)|
| 5:24:57| I also look at whichever water company that develops water out there to have water out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19497)|
| 5:25:03| And no matter what we do, we're going to get that sub-water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19503)|
| 5:25:08| contaminated some way from either farm animals or from other entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19508)|
| 5:25:13| because there's too much development going on and we're really addressing storm water now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19513)|
| 5:25:22| And we've got to look at what we're going to be 10 years from now or 15 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19522)|
| 5:25:28| And we can't do it by saying, no, we're just going to try to leave things as they're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19528)|
| 5:25:36| When I moved in north Knoxville, I exited off the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19536)|
| 5:25:40| and there was a little two-lane road called Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19540)|
| 5:25:43| Now it is a four-lane with a turning lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19543)|
| 5:25:47| I have a traffic jam out there that now takes me an extra 10 minutes to just get to my house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19547)|
| 5:25:53| which is two miles off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19553)|
| 5:25:54| It's developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19554)|
| 5:25:55| It's going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19555)|
| 5:25:56| We are a metropolitan developing area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19556)|
| 5:26:00| So we've got to look at development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19560)|
| 5:26:02| So, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your thought and what you did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19562)|
| 5:26:06| and I appreciate you leading us in that direction of getting Knoxville moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19566)|
| 5:26:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19571)|
| 5:26:14| Seeing no lights, discussion must have ceased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19574)|
| 5:26:19| We have properly before us a motion and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19579)|
| 5:26:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19582)|
| 5:26:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19583)|
| 5:26:24| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19584)|
| 5:26:28| One-none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19588)|
| 5:26:36| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19596)|
| 5:26:42| The next item is on page 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19602)|
| 5:26:44| It's 11-J-15-RZ, the request of the Development Corporation of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19604)|
| 5:26:50| for rezoning from A Agricultural and C.A. General Business to E.C. Employment Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19610)|
| 5:26:55| The property description is the same as the previous item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19615)|
| 5:27:01| Is the applicant still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19621)|
| 5:27:07| Do you wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19627)|
| 5:27:08| No, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19628)|
| 5:27:11| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19631)|
| 5:27:16| Metropolitan Planning Commission, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19636)|
| 5:27:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19641)|
| 5:27:22| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19642)|
| 5:27:23| The Metropolitan Planning Commission did recommend approval of the rezoning by 11-1 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19643)|
| 5:27:28| They found that the conditions which have to be present in order to justify rezoning were met in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19648)|
| 5:27:36| They also discussed the Employment Center zoning for this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19656)|
| 5:27:39| finding that the Employment Center zoning met the concerns of those who spoke in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19659)|
| 5:27:46| the concerns that were identified at community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19666)|
| 5:27:49| I think we've talked a bit about the Employment Center zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19669)|
| 5:27:51| but it does require a development plan to come before the staff and the commission for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19671)|
| 5:27:57| as a use on review prior to implementation of that development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19677)|
| 5:28:01| I think it was a very good observation that was made by the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19681)|
| 5:28:05| that this is a project that will take 10, 15, even 20 years to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19685)|
| 5:28:10| There are a number of conditions that would be placed on that development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19690)|
| 5:28:14| to assure that that development does positively influence the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19694)|
| 5:28:21| I think there are many ways that this business park can impact the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19701)|
| 5:28:25| and those are positive matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19705)|
| 5:28:28| The sector plan that was talked about recently identified in two places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19708)|
| 5:28:33| that the citizens of that sector identified employment needs as one of their major needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19713)|
| 5:28:39| They also said they did not want a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19719)|
| 5:28:42| There are times when we have to face reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19722)|
| 5:28:44| Growth is coming to Knox County, all sectors of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19724)|
| 5:28:48| East Knox County is not immune to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19728)|
| 5:28:50| One of the great things that's come from this process, in my opinion, as director of MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19730)|
| 5:28:55| is the commitment from MPC and the mayor, as you heard earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19735)|
| 5:29:00| to do a community plan for that area so that that community can envision what it wants its future to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19740)|
| 5:29:06| and then work with you as the commission and MPC commissioners and the MPC staff to implement that vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19746)|
| 5:29:12| That will not be easy, and it will take thoughtful processes where people work together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19752)|
| 5:29:17| and I'm positive about that and look forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19757)|
| 5:29:21| And with that, I'll not say anything more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19761)|
| 5:29:24| I do agree with the MPC commission that this is an adequate zoning for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19764)|
| 5:29:29| and would address the concerns that were heard both at the meeting at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19769)|
| 5:29:34| and at the community meetings held to gather public input on this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19774)|
| 5:29:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19778)|
| 5:29:41| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19781)|
| 5:29:43| Does the applicant wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19783)|
| 5:29:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19788)|
| 5:29:49| I'm Tom McAdams, 116 Agnes Road, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19789)|
| 5:29:53| The Developer Corporation, which is the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19793)|
| 5:29:55| Could I get you to move your microphone down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19795)|
| 5:29:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19797)|
| 5:29:58| I can't see your smiling face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19798)|
| 5:30:01| Tom McAdams, 116 Agnes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19801)|
| 5:30:03| The Development Corporation would adopt the statements that were made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19803)|
| 5:30:06| in connection with the sector plan amendment application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19806)|
| 5:30:10| and the documents that were filed and included in your agenda package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19810)|
| 5:30:15| We'll be happy to respond to any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19815)|
| 5:30:17| We do think the changed circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19817)|
| 5:30:19| and other factors required for an amendment of the zoning are appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19819)|
| 5:30:24| and we agree with the recommendation of MPC staff and the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19824)|
| 5:30:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19828)|
| 5:30:30| Thank you, Mr. McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19830)|
| 5:30:32| Mr. Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19832)|
| 5:30:43| Jason Long, 900 Southgate Street, Suite 2102, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19843)|
| 5:30:51| To echo Mr. McAdams, the 8th District Historical Preservation Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19851)|
| 5:30:57| would also adopt the statements that were made in opposition to the change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19857)|
| 5:31:02| in the sector plan as relates to the zoning issue now before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19862)|
| 5:31:10| We obviously take the position that substantial change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19870)|
| 5:31:12| or changed conditions have not occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19872)|
| 5:31:15| which would justify an amendment to the zoning at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19875)|
| 5:31:20| but I think we would be rehashing arguments that you just heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19880)|
| 5:31:23| if I stood up here and did it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19883)|
| 5:31:26| I stand on the materials that we've submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19886)|
| 5:31:28| and the statements that have already been made to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19888)|
| 5:31:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19890)|
| 5:31:32| Thank you, Mr. Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19892)|
| 5:31:33| I appreciate the applicant and the opposition recognizing the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19893)|
| 5:31:39| that we have allowed sector plan change and rezoning information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19899)|
| 5:31:45| to sort of be free-flowing as we've made all of our discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19905)|
| 5:31:48| over the last two and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19908)|
| 5:31:52| I would like to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19912)|
| 5:31:57| Commission discussion is now in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19917)|
| 5:32:01| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19921)|
| 5:32:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19923)|
| 5:32:04| Mr. Green, I just wanted to verify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19924)|
| 5:32:07| I attended the November 12th MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19927)|
| 5:32:10| and I believe when the vote came for this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19930)|
| 5:32:15| it was a unanimous 12-0 vote from all the MPC commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19935)|
| 5:32:21| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19941)|
| 5:32:22| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19942)|
| 5:32:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19943)|
| 5:32:24| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19944)|
| 5:32:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19945)|
| 5:32:26| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19946)|
| 5:32:29| As offered by all the testimony that we received this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19949)|
| 5:32:33| as it relates now to this zoning that's before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19953)|
| 5:32:40| as offered by the Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19960)|
| 5:32:43| I have been informed that wastewater treatment will be at East Bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19963)|
| 5:32:52| that the Development Corporation will accommodate the cemetery in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19972)|
| 5:33:00| which is a cemetery for three local churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19980)|
| 5:33:06| I have a long list here, and I may not get to all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19986)|
| 5:33:09| but I'm just re-plowing some ground that has been offered to us tonight to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19989)|
| 5:33:15| Oh, re-plowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19995)|
| 5:33:16| That's an agribusiness term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19996)|
| 5:33:19| The comments by MPC Commissioner Cain about this may open the door to development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=19999)|
| 5:33:35| without us having a strong plan in place to govern sprawl| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20015)|
| 5:33:41| or what takes place around this or immediately north of the French Broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20021)|
| 5:33:47| It's kind of a large concept area here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20027)|
| 5:33:50| but I appreciate Mayor Burchett including in his request for funding in this coming year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20030)|
| 5:33:57| a $50,000 amount to make sure that we have a suitable plan in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20037)|
| 5:34:04| to protect the character of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20044)|
| 5:34:10| The employment center zoning consists of a lot of use-on-review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20050)|
| 5:34:18| and I expect very thorough use-on-review rules being applied to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20058)|
| 5:34:24| because of the structure and lay, the topography of the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20064)|
| 5:34:33| I made sort of a sliding comment about agribusiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20073)|
| 5:34:38| I grew up on a farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20078)|
| 5:34:39| I know what a dairy farm is like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20079)|
| 5:34:41| My two younger brothers and I, we are currently farming about 150 acres by committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20081)|
| 5:34:46| and it's wearing us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20086)|
| 5:34:49| I'm too old to farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20089)|
| 5:34:52| But I do ask that a note be added by the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20092)|
| 5:35:00| that as this area looks at, there could possibly be 20% commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20100)|
| 5:35:07| 20% retail inside this business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20107)|
| 5:35:13| and I do not use the, I do not switch the words back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20113)|
| 5:35:18| industrial park, business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20118)|
| 5:35:21| I expect, I'm not demanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20121)|
| 5:35:24| I'm expecting that the bus tour is representative of what we're going to get in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20124)|
| 5:35:30| and I'm also now opening a new, what I would like to see included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20130)|
| 5:35:35| if you can get someone to come and do a business which is commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20135)|
| 5:35:41| You know, somebody needs to be in there making sandwiches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20141)|
| 5:35:44| for all these hundreds of thousands of people that are going to be employed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20144)|
| 5:35:50| That there be some consideration for an agribusiness, farmer's market location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20150)|
| 5:35:58| with a big square room so that the community will have a place that they can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20158)|
| 5:36:03| in addition to the public use land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20163)|
| 5:36:07| which is going to be parks and trails and things of that nature on the unbuildable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20167)|
| 5:36:15| Now, I'm going to ask some rhetorical questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20175)|
| 5:36:18| because these are already in the minutes of the meeting at the Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20178)|
| 5:36:24| but will there be rock quarries, slaughterhouses, leather tanneries, or truck stops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20184)|
| 5:36:35| The physical answer that was given at the Development Corporation as in their meeting is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20195)|
| 5:36:41| There will be none of those things there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20201)|
| 5:36:49| And I also think that I somehow got around to a few minutes later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20209)|
| 5:36:53| in that discussion of smokestack industries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20213)|
| 5:36:59| and I believe that the Development Corporation is shying away from smokestack industries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20219)|
| 5:37:05| and I believe Commissioner McKenzie's line of questioning about how much water would be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20225)|
| 5:37:12| may be an indication that such activities may not be in line there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20232)|
| 5:37:22| So, I've got 40 other things here, but I'm going to stop right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20242)|
| 5:37:31| because as the items were discussed earlier, I checked off what is being offered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20251)|
| 5:37:41| and I want to use this request for rezoning with these other attached offers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20261)|
| 5:37:55| that would, according to MPC recommendation, be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20275)|
| 5:38:02| I see no lights for further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20282)|
| 5:38:06| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20286)|
| 5:38:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20289)|
| 5:38:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20292)|
| 5:38:13| Per MPC recommendations, with other offers as, I need this to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20293)|
| 5:38:20| with other offers as expressed by the Development Corporation during tonight's testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20300)|
| 5:38:30| Motion then is properly before us, properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20310)|
| 5:38:34| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20314)|
| 5:38:38| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20318)|
| 5:38:44| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20324)|
| 5:38:49| 10-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20329)|
| 5:38:53| Is there other business to, now don't get up and run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20333)|
| 5:38:57| is there other business to become before Knox County zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20337)|
| 5:39:02| Mr. Chairman, could I ask one question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20342)|
| 5:39:05| Yes, we have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20345)|
| 5:39:07| I didn't hear who seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20347)|
| 5:39:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20350)|
| 5:39:14| Oh, the one that went to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20354)|
| 5:39:16| We have the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20356)|
| 5:39:19| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20359)|
| 5:39:25| The first zoning request that we had, which was 10N15RZ, was moved to the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20365)|
| 5:39:34| Is that applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20374)|
| 5:39:36| H.E. Biddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20376)|
| 5:39:39| The third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20379)|
| 5:39:41| Is that applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20381)|
| 5:39:44| I believe it just rolls off the agenda, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20384)|
| 5:39:46| Is that right, Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20386)|
| 5:39:48| It's his second appearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20388)|
| 5:39:53| No, you can't deny it without him here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20393)|
| 5:39:55| I don't think that's, I think it rolls off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20395)|
| 5:39:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20399)|
| 5:40:00| Due to the applicant not being here, do we have to have a motion, you think, to say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20400)|
| 5:40:05| I make a motion that it rolls off the agenda unless Mr. Green failed to notify him, but I bet he didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20405)|
| 5:40:10| We notified him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20410)|
| 5:40:11| I make a motion that it rolls off the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20411)|
| 5:40:15| It is rolled off the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20415)|
| 5:40:19| Is the motion before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20419)|
| 5:40:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20420)|
| 5:40:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20422)|
| 5:40:23| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20423)|
| 5:40:25| Are there other items to come before Knox County sitting as the Board of Zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20425)|
| 5:40:31| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20431)|
| 5:40:34| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20434)|
| 5:40:35| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20435)|
| 5:40:37| Always every month we handle a sector plan and a zoning as two separate items anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20437)|
| 5:40:44| Why this month are they not one after, listed one after the other on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20444)|
| 5:40:52| Why are all the sector plans first and then, I mean, it's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20452)|
| 5:40:55| It's always discombobulated on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20455)|
| 5:40:58| We just move them together, but it's based on the alphabet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20458)|
| 5:41:02| No, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20462)|
| 5:41:05| Let me call on the Director of Commissioned Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20465)|
| 5:41:11| It's the way they appear on the Agenda Quick program, and when I do the agenda, I do it in order of how they appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20471)|
| 5:41:21| But there's always been an order on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20481)|
| 5:41:23| We haven't really had anything before us in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20483)|
| 5:41:27| We're just getting busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20487)|
| 5:41:30| We will look at it and see what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20490)|
| 5:41:33| We will ask the IT people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20493)|
| 5:41:36| I'll ask Mr. Moran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20496)|
| 5:41:38| I'll pay more attention and try to get it in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20498)|
| 5:41:41| We were really rushed for this agenda, and so I just put it on in the order that it was attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20501)|
| 5:41:51| Are there other items to be discussed as zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20511)|
| 5:41:56| If not, the zoning meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20516)|
| 5:42:02| Recess the Board of Commissioners of Knox County from recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20522)|
| 5:42:10| I'd like to make a motion that we move the other items to the next month's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20530)|
| 5:42:14| the next two discussion items to the next month's agenda, and redo them then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20534)|
| 5:42:22| Well, there's one that some commissioners may would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20542)|
| 5:42:25| I was just trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20545)|
| 5:42:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20546)|
| 5:42:27| We'd like to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20547)|
| 5:42:28| Ed's got to drive home, you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20548)|
| 5:42:31| Interchange will be clear by the time he gets there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20551)|
| 5:42:35| It will be built by the time you get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20555)|
| 5:42:40| We'll discuss this one item first and then see where we stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20560)|
| 5:42:43| The item to be discussed, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20563)|
| 5:42:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20567)|
| 5:42:48| Commissioner Bussler and I in October saw the wireless voting program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20568)|
| 5:42:53| and we asked Purchasing to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20573)|
| 5:42:57| We did get the reply back from Matt Myers with the Purchasing Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20577)|
| 5:43:02| and basically 15 county commissioners in Tennessee are currently using this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20582)|
| 5:43:12| I personally had a chance to talk with Williamson County Mayor about this wireless voting program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20592)|
| 5:43:19| and he just said it was absolutely awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20599)|
| 5:43:22| Matt Myers checked with Blount County and Putnam County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20602)|
| 5:43:26| and the vendor is willing to give us a 30-day trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20606)|
| 5:43:31| All we basically have to do is have a guarantee from Purchasing that they'll put it on a credit card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20611)|
| 5:43:38| and when it's returned, I guess that that cost will be returned to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20618)|
| 5:43:43| But basically all the counties surrounding Knox County are on this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20623)|
| 5:43:49| including Anderson, Blount, Hamlin, Hawkins, and Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20629)|
| 5:43:54| They all have 21 commission members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20634)|
| 5:43:56| They need something to keep them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20636)|
| 5:43:58| Mr. Chairman, could we have them come in and do a presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20638)|
| 5:44:02| Well, that's why they're going to give you the 30-day trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20642)|
| 5:44:05| They're not with my credit card, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20645)|
| 5:44:09| That's a security deposit, as you know, and they're based out of Illinois or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20649)|
| 5:44:15| But they do have a complete training and support program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20655)|
| 5:44:18| and, of course, the equipment has a one-year warranty as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20658)|
| 5:44:23| Let us pause for just a second, and I will recognize Dr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20663)|
| 5:44:27| He may short-circuit our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20667)|
| 5:44:30| Just a little, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20670)|
| 5:44:33| Anything that we do in relationship to this room has to be approved by PBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20673)|
| 5:44:39| and this room is managed by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20679)|
| 5:44:42| And so anything that we want to change, we have to bring before them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20682)|
| 5:44:48| And if the city wants to go in with us, then that cost is halved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20688)|
| 5:44:53| Let's pause for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20693)|
| 5:44:55| I believe what we're doing is a stand-alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20695)|
| 5:44:59| Each commissioner will have a handheld device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20699)|
| 5:45:02| It will run off a laptop, which is ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20702)|
| 5:45:05| and will not involve drilling any holes or installing any equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20705)|
| 5:45:10| It will be we carry it home and vote all month with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20710)|
| 5:45:15| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20715)|
| 5:45:16| There is nothing hardwired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20716)|
| 5:45:18| That's my line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20718)|
| 5:45:20| Does that allay your fears about the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20720)|
| 5:45:26| I think you need to talk to PBA first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20726)|
| 5:45:29| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20729)|
| 5:45:30| It alleviates my fears, yes, as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20730)|
| 5:45:34| Anything that goes through technology as it relates to this room has to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20734)|
| 5:45:40| It will be no more obtrusive than us laying something down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20740)|
| 5:45:44| which we occasionally press a button on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20744)|
| 5:45:47| The only other thing I would say is, from a funding standpoint, where is that appropriated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20747)|
| 5:45:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20755)|
| 5:45:56| That would be my question, would be the appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20756)|
| 5:46:00| Continuing, Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20760)|
| 5:46:02| I was just going to say our IT department is aware of what's going on, too, Mr. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20762)|
| 5:46:08| so they understand what the system is as well as purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20768)|
| 5:46:12| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20772)|
| 5:46:14| My whole point was if it was going to be anything that is related to in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20774)|
| 5:46:20| then it had to go through PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20780)|
| 5:46:22| But if it's not, then it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20782)|
| 5:46:23| If we ended up having a commission meeting in North Knoxville, we'd take that product with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20783)|
| 5:46:28| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20788)|
| 5:46:29| That's easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20789)|
| 5:46:33| The next thing that does come up, Commissioner Schoonmaker, is the expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20793)|
| 5:46:37| We do not have allocated funds to cover this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20797)|
| 5:46:42| We're talking $14,750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20802)|
| 5:46:50| I can get a car for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20810)|
| 5:46:54| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20814)|
| 5:46:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20818)|
| 5:46:59| I'm not big on spending money that we don't need to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20819)|
| 5:47:03| And the only reason I say that is aren't 99% of our votes all vocal and it's unanimous or it's one person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20823)|
| 5:47:13| So I don't see a need, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20833)|
| 5:47:17| Last month I used up two of my numbers and I used one of my numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20837)|
| 5:47:22| I used one of my numbers this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20842)|
| 5:47:25| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20845)|
| 5:47:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20849)|
| 5:47:30| Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20850)|
| 5:47:33| I told you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20853)|
| 5:47:36| He's got to be here, you've got to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20856)|
| 5:47:40| We started this meeting on my birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20860)|
| 5:47:41| We're bound not to finish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20861)|
| 5:47:43| 12.01 is my goal now, Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20863)|
| 5:47:45| Your birthday will be over by the time you get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20865)|
| 5:47:48| You'll be here a whole year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20868)|
| 5:47:50| What is the amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20870)|
| 5:47:52| Is it $25,000 or less that we have to bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20872)|
| 5:47:55| Oh, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20875)|
| 5:47:56| Let me think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20876)|
| 5:47:57| Dang, it's late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20877)|
| 5:47:59| I think anything over $10,000 you have to get three quotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20879)|
| 5:48:03| Anything over $25,000 you have to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20883)|
| 5:48:06| Okay, so we could have that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20886)|
| 5:48:11| But I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20891)|
| 5:48:13| I like this electronic voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20893)|
| 5:48:17| It's getting late and I'm having a hard time thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20897)|
| 5:48:32| This is a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20912)|
| 5:48:33| This is a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20913)|
| 5:48:34| Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20914)|
| 5:48:35| Are you finished, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20915)|
| 5:48:37| Commissioner McKenzie is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20917)|
| 5:48:39| So this is just for Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20919)|
| 5:48:43| Being until our illustrious chair started moving the first vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20923)|
| 5:48:48| being the first vote for eight years can be problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20928)|
| 5:48:52| Because folks read the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20932)|
| 5:48:54| So it really does help a solid vote happen at one time as opposed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20934)|
| 5:49:01| you know, it's kind of like if we were running for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20941)|
| 5:49:05| okay, some votes start trickling in this day of early election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20945)|
| 5:49:09| and we knew real time what the vote was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20949)|
| 5:49:11| So there are some advantages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20951)|
| 5:49:13| We actually brought an entity in here my first couple of years, two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20953)|
| 5:49:18| and we evaluated them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20958)|
| 5:49:21| So I'll say, you know, being a short timer, there are some advantages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20961)|
| 5:49:28| Commissioner Bessler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20968)|
| 5:49:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20969)|
| 5:49:31| Having seen this thing work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20971)|
| 5:49:33| what happens is the people that are keeping the records here see it right up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20973)|
| 5:49:38| It's on their screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20978)|
| 5:49:40| It also goes on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20980)|
| 5:49:41| It also goes on the television side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20981)|
| 5:49:45| And the vote doesn't occur until everybody presses their little button| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20985)|
| 5:49:49| where it's yes, no, or pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20989)|
| 5:49:51| So we know that before it's ever done, we know how it's going to be voted right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20991)|
| 5:49:56| And I think the biggest thing about it is it can be also rented out to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=20996)|
| 5:50:03| and also to the MPC so we could get most of our money back on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21003)|
| 5:50:08| It's a true vote because, you know, if you're sitting over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21008)|
| 5:50:12| Use your microphone there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21012)|
| 5:50:14| Ain't nobody here to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21014)|
| 5:50:16| Yes, you're still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21016)|
| 5:50:18| You're a star.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21018)|
| 5:50:19| That's the only way you get a true vote because if it starts over there in the first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21019)|
| 5:50:25| I may be waffling on whether I want to vote or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21025)|
| 5:50:28| But then I say yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21028)|
| 5:50:32| Then I say, hey, I might as well go along with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21032)|
| 5:50:35| Whereas if we all punch a button at the same time, you've got to make up your mind, Jack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21035)|
| 5:50:40| Commissioner Brown, can we have the other two discussion items next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21040)|
| 5:50:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21045)|
| 5:50:46| Works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21046)|
| 5:50:48| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21048)|
| 5:50:50| The thing I also wanted to say about it is it's 30 days, enough time to try this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21050)|
| 5:50:58| It will take us at least one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21058)|
| 5:51:00| I know the learning curve here, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21060)|
| 5:51:04| Do you have faith in us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21064)|
| 5:51:07| I'm just thinking 60 days, 90 days, a couple of sessions with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21067)|
| 5:51:12| I can see us up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21072)|
| 5:51:17| Three meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21077)|
| 5:51:18| Another work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21078)|
| 5:51:21| That may be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21081)|
| 5:51:22| Say 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21082)|
| 5:51:23| Okay, 45 days or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21083)|
| 5:51:24| I think if we can negotiate 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21084)|
| 5:51:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21086)|
| 5:51:33| One other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21093)|
| 5:51:35| If it is approved by the commission to buy it at this price that it's going to, we'd have to put it out for bid correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21095)|
| 5:51:43| Get three quotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21103)|
| 5:51:45| Three quotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21105)|
| 5:51:46| Okay, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21106)|
| 5:51:47| I don't think there's three companies that do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21107)|
| 5:51:49| That's the problem, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21109)|
| 5:51:52| Don't give her one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21112)|
| 5:51:54| That'll be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21114)|
| 5:51:57| Are you getting ready to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21117)|
| 5:51:58| Any announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21118)|
| 5:52:01| Yeah, I just wanted to thank community TV for hanging in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21121)|
| 5:52:04| We really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21124)|
| 5:52:06| We hope you got a sandwich, and thanks again for your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21126)|
| 5:52:11| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21131)|
| 5:52:13| I actually wanted to talk about the discussion item real briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21133)|
| 5:52:17| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21137)|
| 5:52:18| The safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21138)|
| 5:52:21| Yeah, but they may bring us a proposal next month is what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21141)|
| 5:52:24| Then we're going to have to discuss it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21144)|
| 5:52:26| If there be no further business come before the commission, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267151221?start=21146)|
