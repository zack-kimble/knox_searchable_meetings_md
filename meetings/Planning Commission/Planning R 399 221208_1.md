| 2:38:58| Existing land use, agricultural, forestry, vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9538)|
| 2:39:01| Proposed use to attach residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9541)|
| 2:39:05| Number of lots, 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9545)|
| 2:39:10| There are subdivision variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9550)|
| 2:39:12| No, there are no subdivision variances required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9552)|
| 2:39:16| And there are two motions on this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9556)|
| 2:39:21| The first motion would be staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9561)|
| 2:39:24| Approve the concept plan subject to six conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9564)|
| 2:39:29| And the second motion on the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9569)|
| 2:39:31| Approve the development plan for up to 14 attached houses on individual lots subject to two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9571)|
| 2:39:38| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9578)|
| 2:39:44| Steve Hall, 3127 T Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9584)|
| 2:39:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9589)|
| 2:39:50| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9590)|
| 2:39:52| Would you like to speak or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9592)|
| 2:39:55| I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9595)|
| 2:39:57| Opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9597)|
| 2:40:05| David Thompson, 8005 Pettigo Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9605)|
| 2:40:10| I see that this development doesn't meet certain criteria as far as what's in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9610)|
| 2:40:19| First off, it shouldn't significantly increase the traffic flow on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9619)|
| 2:40:26| Greenwood Bishop is a two-lane road that is years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9626)|
| 2:40:31| basically designed for your John Deere tractor to get from farm to farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9631)|
| 2:40:36| It's not been improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9636)|
| 2:40:38| It's not been widened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9638)|
| 2:40:40| It has several blind hills, blind curves on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9640)|
| 2:40:44| This development is approximately 1.2 miles from Emory Road close to I-75,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9644)|
| 2:40:52| which is already heavily traveled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9652)|
| 2:40:55| You can't get down that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9655)|
| 2:41:02| If a school bus tries to pass a car on that street, one of them has to get in the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9662)|
| 2:41:08| The development entrances and exits are approximately within 120 feet of a blind curve and a blind hill, all 14 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9668)|
| 2:41:22| The infrastructure at this time is just not there to support this type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9682)|
| 2:41:30| As being consistent with the character of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9690)|
| 2:41:35| most houses out there are one to two per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9695)|
| 2:41:41| with most of them, a lot of them, being one per five-plus acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9701)|
| 2:41:48| So concentrating this amount of buildings in such a small area would be completely overbuilt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9708)|
| 2:42:00| The way it says the development is four point-something acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9720)|
| 2:42:04| but when you look at the buildable area of it and you look at the lot sizes that they're proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9724)|
| 2:42:12| you're only like 1.4 acres or 8.4 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9732)|
| 2:42:17| So we're talking more than seven per acre, which is not consistent with that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9737)|
| 2:42:27| Also, this proposal adjoins approximately 800 feet of my property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9747)|
| 2:42:38| A proposed stormwater detention area right next to my property covers about 160 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9758)|
| 2:42:50| I think this would restrict any future building or construction on my land due to possibility of flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9770)|
| 2:42:59| So based on what I've presented to you today, I would ask that you reject this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9779)|
| 2:43:13| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9793)|
| 2:43:23| Appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9803)|
| 2:43:26| I respectfully disagree with a couple of the points there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9806)|
| 2:43:30| The stack recommendations were consistent with the density and the dwellings per acre of most of the developments around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9810)|
| 2:43:36| Could you get a little bit closer to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9816)|
| 2:43:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9818)|
| 2:43:39| The staff recommendations are consistent with most of the density and dwellings per acre around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9819)|
| 2:43:47| Specifically across the street, there's a development of similar density as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9827)|
| 2:43:52| There's also been pretty significant investment in the traffic flow in Bishop and Pedigo there to get out on Emery Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9832)|
| 2:44:01| like Mr. Campbell referenced there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9841)|
| 2:44:04| So I would reference those as far as his objections and appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9844)|
| 2:44:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9852)|
| 2:44:13| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9853)|
| 2:44:17| Chair, I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9857)|
| 2:44:21| First, somewhere in the room, there's a device playing videos or music or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9861)|
| 2:44:30| I don't know where it is, but it's a little distracting for those of us up here and mixing the rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9870)|
| 2:44:39| It's kind of hard to pay attention to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9879)|
| 2:44:42| Just if anybody, maybe their phone is going and they don't realize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9882)|
| 2:44:46| Anyways, with that being said, I'd like to make a motion to approve the concept plan subject to the six conditions listed in the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9886)|
| 2:44:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9897)|
| 2:45:02| Commissioner Higgins has made a motion to approve the concept plan subject to six conditions, seconded by Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9902)|
| 2:45:12| Seeing no lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9912)|
| 2:45:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9914)|
| 2:45:15| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9915)|
| 2:45:16| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9916)|
| 2:45:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9917)|
| 2:45:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9918)|
| 2:45:21| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9921)|
| 2:45:22| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9922)|
| 2:45:23| Motion two on the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9923)|
| 2:45:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9925)|
| 2:45:26| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the development plan for the 14 attached houses on the individual lot subject to the two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9926)|
| 2:45:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9932)|
| 2:45:34| A motion on the development plan for staff recommendation by Vice Chair Uten, seconded by Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9934)|
| 2:45:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9944)|
| 2:45:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9945)|
| 2:45:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9946)|
| 2:45:47| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9947)|
| 2:45:52| 37, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9952)|
| 2:45:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9954)|
| 2:45:55| Agenda item 37, applicant Smithfield Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9955)|
| 2:45:59| Location, north and south sides, excuse me, of West Emory Road, west of Rio Grande Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9959)|
| 2:46:07| Approximate size of the track, 305.6 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9967)|
| 2:46:11| Zoning, floodway, agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9971)|
| 2:46:14| Existing land use, agriculture, forestry, vacant land, rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9974)|
| 2:46:18| Proposed use, planned development with residential and non-residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9978)|
| 2:46:25| Staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9985)|
| 2:46:29| Postpone the Belltown preliminary plan until January 12, 2023 planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9989)|
| 2:46:37| The applicant present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=9997)|
| 2:46:41| Mr. Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10001)|
| 2:46:44| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10004)|
| 2:46:47| Would you like to defer or speak, Mr. Sanderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10007)|
| 2:46:50| Let the opposition speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10010)|
| 2:46:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10011)|
| 2:46:54| Oh, good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10014)|
| 2:46:58| My name is Julie Fritz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10018)|
| 2:46:59| I live in Carnes, and I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10019)|
| 2:47:02| Ms. Fritz, before you get started, if you don't mind, would you please...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10022)|
| 2:47:06| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10026)|
| 2:47:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10027)|
| 2:47:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10028)|
| 2:47:09| And you all have my address for record, so I'd prefer not to give that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10029)|
| 2:47:13| Thank you for the opportunity to present today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10033)|
| 2:47:16| This development, like you said, is over 300 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10036)|
| 2:47:21| It is located on Emory Road between the Carnes and the Powell community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10041)|
| 2:47:27| The proposed amount of homes is 1,100 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10047)|
| 2:47:33| As far as I know, it is there about five homes per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10053)|
| 2:47:39| I've talked with many residents in and around the area, and one of the biggest things we have thought about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10059)|
| 2:47:48| is that the density is too high for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10068)|
| 2:47:52| I know that Josh stated back in June that they only had 80 homes in the Carnes area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10072)|
| 2:47:59| I've done some math, and right now Mr. Smith has two developments underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10079)|
| 2:48:08| That is yielding 126 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10088)|
| 2:48:11| Then we will add the 1,100 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10091)|
| 2:48:13| So we've got right at 1,200 homes within a three-mile area in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10093)|
| 2:48:26| And I got all this information from the June meeting that Mr. Sanderson talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10106)|
| 2:48:35| We're not really sure why there's such a hurry to do this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10115)|
| 2:48:38| and to go ahead and get it on the books and agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10118)|
| 2:48:44| The only thing that we can think of is the advanced Knox is coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10124)|
| 2:48:50| That will be in May of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10130)|
| 2:48:53| That will change some of the standards for the development, as far as I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10133)|
| 2:49:00| which a lot of residents in and around the area and other areas in Knox County will be thankful for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10140)|
| 2:49:08| This planning and all the issues that we have with, and I'm not being nasty or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10148)|
| 2:49:19| with the planning commission is completely out of date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10159)|
| 2:49:23| It's been over 20 years since there have been any updates to these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10163)|
| 2:49:30| We have continued to have the status quo for that amount of time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10170)|
| 2:49:36| Knox County citizens will finally have an input as to what they want in and around their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10176)|
| 2:49:43| This development is to have, as far as my knowledge goes in my meeting with Mr. Sanderson back in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10183)|
| 2:49:50| there's going to be senior living, there's going to be homes, apartments, commercial property, and parks and rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10190)|
| 2:49:56| Also included in their design is an amphitheater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10196)|
| 2:49:59| There are three neighborhoods that are going to be directly affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10199)|
| 2:50:05| One is Washington Heights, Notre Villa, and Birchfield Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10205)|
| 2:50:09| These areas have been here for quite a while now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10209)|
| 2:50:12| Those residents at least have one home on at least one to three acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10212)|
| 2:50:19| and anywhere from a quarter acre to a half acre of where their homes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10219)|
| 2:50:28| There are issues with all of these things that they want to do and put in on that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10228)|
| 2:50:35| and some of those include the noise that will be generated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10235)|
| 2:50:40| not only from the traffic that will be in and out of those, bless you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10240)|
| 2:50:44| but also on the other side, forgive me for the directional, I'm challenged on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10244)|
| 2:50:50| but with that, apartments, the amphitheater, the parks that will be donated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10250)|
| 2:50:57| and on that side also I mentioned to Josh that there's going to be senior living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10257)|
| 2:51:03| If y'all have parents that are seniors, this part of the plan is going to literally back up to those floodplains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10263)|
| 2:51:12| and then on down the street, to my understanding, are going to be apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10272)|
| 2:51:17| and then there's going to be commercial businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10277)|
| 2:51:21| That really is not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10281)|
| 2:51:23| As a registered nurse, older people have neurological deficits, vision, hearing, mobility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10283)|
| 2:51:30| driving a car, decreased reflexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10290)|
| 2:51:33| Then you have kids in townhomes, apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10293)|
| 2:51:36| That is set up for some serious issues, possibly even injuries, and maybe even someone being killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10296)|
| 2:51:46| If you go towards the intersection, and can I ask for more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10306)|
| 2:51:51| because this really involves a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10311)|
| 2:51:54| Try to wrap up as quickly as you can. I'll be as gracious as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10314)|
| 2:51:58| Okay. If you go out of the neighborhood and turn left, you're going to dead end to Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10318)|
| 2:52:04| There is a red light there, thank the Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10324)|
| 2:52:07| But that traffic backs up, you're going to turn right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10327)|
| 2:52:11| That is a huge problem during work hours and school hours to get on up to Clinton Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10331)|
| 2:52:18| to navigate up to 275 and 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10338)|
| 2:52:23| If you're coming back home on 131 and you're going to turn left off of Emery Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10343)|
| 2:52:29| that traffic backs up, I don't know if you all are familiar with this, back to Travis Meat Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10349)|
| 2:52:37| and also there's a trailer park that sits right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10357)|
| 2:52:40| and nobody can get in and out of there. It is absolutely horrific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10360)|
| 2:52:44| People try to go through that red light, they're ending up in the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10364)|
| 2:52:48| Food City's right there, and some more businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10368)|
| 2:52:53| We get to Mr. Snowden, the intersection of Carpenter, West Emery, and Harold Roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10373)|
| 2:53:03| There's also going to be traffic coming from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10383)|
| 2:53:06| There is a Smithfield neighborhood that literally is probably 300 yards, if I have to guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10386)|
| 2:53:13| That traffic is coming to that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10393)|
| 2:53:16| These people are going to be coming down to go to Oak Ridge, Carnes Valley, over on the northwest end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10396)|
| 2:53:24| So we're going to have a plug there at Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10404)|
| 2:53:28| We're going to have a plug...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10408)|
| 2:53:29| Ms. Fitz, I gave you an extra minute. If you could wrap up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10409)|
| 2:53:31| Okay, thank you. A plugged up area right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10411)|
| 2:53:33| It's a horrific intersection. We keep hearing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10413)|
| 2:53:36| It's going to be worked. It was supposed to be in 20, now it's 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10416)|
| 2:53:41| So given all of that, and if you go to Beaver Ridge and Byington Road in West Emery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10421)|
| 2:53:49| there's yet another subdivision by Smithfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10429)|
| 2:53:52| If you've not been to that intersection, go to that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10432)|
| 2:53:56| All those people come off Carnes Valley, you won't get through for many, many minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10436)|
| 2:54:01| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10441)|
| 2:54:03| Oh, can I just do one more thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10443)|
| 2:54:05| I think I've given you a lot of latitude there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10445)|
| 2:54:07| I know, I know, and I appreciate this, but this is a huge, huge development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10447)|
| 2:54:14| There are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10454)|
| 2:54:16| Ms. Fritz, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10456)|
| 2:54:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10462)|
| 2:54:23| Would the applicant like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10463)|
| 2:54:25| Do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10465)|
| 2:54:26| Would the applicant like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10466)|
| 2:54:28| I sure will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10468)|
| 2:54:32| You'll get me back. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10472)|
| 2:54:35| I'm sorry. I try to be as liberal with the rules as I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10475)|
| 2:54:40| Mr. Brown, are you going to allow Mr. Murphy to speak, or has his time been all used up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10480)|
| 2:54:46| Mr. Murphy, are you signed up to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10486)|
| 2:54:50| 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10490)|
| 2:54:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10491)|
| 2:54:55| Apologize. Mr. Sanderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10495)|
| 2:54:57| I'll be very brief. Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10497)|
| 2:55:00| One thing that I noticed that's germane to look at in the design guidelines in Section 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10500)|
| 2:55:06| each one of those has a section that talks about signs, and it refers to the Knox County zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10506)|
| 2:55:12| The zoning ordinance, when you look at signs, it doesn't deal about the uses, these additional uses that are being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10512)|
| 2:55:19| It looks at the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10519)|
| 2:55:21| So if I was a permitting person or somebody like on the Board of Zoning Appeals asked to look at variances or stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10521)|
| 2:55:28| I'd be very confused looking at these design guidelines to figure out what signs actually apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10528)|
| 2:55:33| So I think the sign standards need to be looked at and specified in these design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10533)|
| 2:55:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10540)|
| 2:55:52| Good evening, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10552)|
| 2:55:54| I am Josh Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10554)|
| 2:55:55| I am here representing Smithville Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10555)|
| 2:55:57| I am the thorn in the staff's side for the last six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10557)|
| 2:56:01| and I'm sure they're happy about putting me with you all as you're all's problem tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10561)|
| 2:56:09| This being the first time a plan development's ever come before Knox County, I'm not sure exactly what to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10569)|
| 2:56:16| but what I envisioned was introduce it to you all, tell you how we got here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10576)|
| 2:56:23| how the process is interpreted in our mind as far as submittals and applications and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10583)|
| 2:56:29| the vision we have for it, and then kind of wrap it up with Q&A because I know you all will have a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10589)|
| 2:56:36| So starting with just what we have, we have Belltown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10596)|
| 2:56:38| We have a large farm, obviously a large farm, that we've owned and have always had our eye on for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10598)|
| 2:56:46| Because of the size and because of today's economy and because of everything moving forward with housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10606)|
| 2:56:53| it makes sense to go the plan development route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10613)|
| 2:56:57| This isn't exactly what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10617)|
| 2:57:00| We would normally just zone it and then come do the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10620)|
| 2:57:04| but the process of how we got here and how I'm standing in front of you tonight goes like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10624)|
| 2:57:11| Friday, May 13th, myself, Rocky Smith, Cody Smith met with Mayor Jacobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10631)|
| 2:57:18| former Director of Knox County Planning, Amy Brooks, and County Commissioner Terry Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10638)|
| 2:57:23| We laid this out for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10643)|
| 2:57:24| They said this would be a perfect opportunity to do the plan development, and let's go down that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10644)|
| 2:57:30| Thursday, June 9th, I came here in front of you all and presented the concept or the pretty picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10650)|
| 2:57:38| It wasn't a voting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10658)|
| 2:57:39| It was just kind of a blessing and some feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10659)|
| 2:57:41| We got your all's feedback and started implementing the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10661)|
| 2:57:45| Wednesday, June 29th, Ms. Fritz hosted a community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10665)|
| 2:57:49| That's my favorite part of this entire process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10669)|
| 2:57:53| It was for public input and public feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10673)|

| 2:57:58| Members of Knox County staff showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10678)|
| 2:58:01| Overall, I think we accomplished a lot there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10681)|
| 2:58:04| We got a lot of feedback that got implemented into the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10684)|

| 2:58:27| That continued into additional conversations with D.A.R., Daughters of American Revolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10707)|

| 2:59:11| On Wednesday, August 31st, I met with Parks and Recreation Introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10751)|

| 3:00:16| Friday, September 23rd, I submitted what I thought would be the final application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10816)|
| 3:00:19| to come before you all in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10819)|
| 3:00:25| Tuesday, October 18th, Knox County staff, with Mike Reynolds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10825)|
| 3:00:29| sent me back comments and questions regarding my first submittal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10829)|
| 3:00:33| And to be honest with you, I submitted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10833)|
| 3:00:35| I was a C-plus student in college, and that was a C-plus application, maybe a B-minus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10835)|
| 3:00:39| I submitted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10839)|
| 3:00:41| Mike pointed out, or Knox County staff pointed out, a lot of just, it just wasn't good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10841)|
| 3:00:46| It wasn't clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10846)|
| 3:00:48| So I, the developer, the family, we asked for Knox County to actually postpone it for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10848)|
| 3:00:57| and that was when I submitted it on Tuesday, October 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10857)|
| 3:01:02| The entire month since the day we said we were going to postpone, we broke this down, every item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10862)|
| 3:01:08| We went through everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10868)|
| 3:01:09| And what's so difficult about this is this is forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10869)|
| 3:01:13| Without major changes, we had to come and think about everything that might go into this forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10873)|
| 3:01:18| And the single family, you all know we do that every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10878)|
| 3:01:22| We do, that's our bread and butter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10882)|
| 3:01:24| The apartments, how many apartments, the layout of it, the commercial, the uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10884)|
| 3:01:29| which we need to dive back, we will dive into, the townhomes, the senior, the layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10889)|
| 3:01:34| So we just had to get it down and grind to it to where we had to think of the forever use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10894)|
| 3:01:39| We're not zoning this thing, and you all have the zoning parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10899)|
| 3:01:42| We're taking ideas from this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10902)|
| 3:01:44| We're taking ideas from this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10904)|
| 3:01:46| We're mushing it all together into this planned development, and that's kind of how we saw the process working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10906)|
| 3:01:54| We submit what we think is a concept, which in a perfect world, we'll grade it, we'll develop it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10914)|
| 3:02:00| and in 10 years it will spit out exactly like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10920)|
| 3:02:03| If it can't spit out like this, this is the bylaws that Knox County staff can go by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10923)|
| 3:02:08| and kind of give them parameters to make decisions based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10928)|
| 3:02:11| so we don't have to keep coming back and it's a constant fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10931)|
| 3:02:14| This is what we want, but if we can't achieve that, here's what we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10934)|
| 3:02:17| and if this can't clarify, this packet can't clarify any changes that we want to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10937)|
| 3:02:23| then we got to come back in front of you and let you all vote on it to decide if we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10943)|
| 3:02:27| if that change is justifiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10947)|
| 3:02:29| So with the process and the meetings we've had, I'm here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10949)|
| 3:02:36| I'm beat up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10956)|
| 3:02:39| I'm hat in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10959)|
| 3:02:41| I'm humble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10961)|
| 3:02:42| I'm ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10962)|
| 3:02:43| I've eaten, sleeping, and dreamed about Belltown to the point I'm sick of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10963)|
| 3:02:49| But we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10969)|
| 3:02:50| Thank you, Mr. Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10970)|
| 3:02:51| We're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10971)|
| 3:02:52| So I'll wrap up by saying I know you all are going to have a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10972)|
| 3:02:58| The vision, a live-work-play atmosphere, a multigenerational mom, dad, grandparents can all live in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10978)|
| 3:03:05| maybe not next door but in different segments of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10985)|
| 3:03:08| Weekends, you don't have to get in your car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10988)|
| 3:03:10| You're going to go down to the pharmacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10990)|
| 3:03:11| You're going to go down to the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10991)|
| 3:03:12| You're going to go down to the park and play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10992)|
| 3:03:14| On a weekend, you don't have to get in your car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10994)|
| 3:03:17| A walkable, a safe, a staple for this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=10997)|
| 3:03:24| Julie brought up Advanced Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11004)|
| 3:03:26| I am lucky enough to serve on that board or that committee because of my involvement with the Home Builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11006)|
| 3:03:33| And I'll be honest with you, this plays into exactly what Advanced Knox is gearing towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11013)|
| 3:03:40| If this was the case, we need to take all our other land and get it in quick before Advanced Knox comes through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11020)|
| 3:03:48| because this will meet the parameters and is what the public opinion has been gathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11028)|
| 3:03:55| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11035)|
| 3:03:56| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11036)|
| 3:03:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11037)|
| 3:03:58| Comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11038)|
| 3:03:59| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11039)|
| 3:04:00| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11040)|
| 3:04:03| Bear with me just a minute, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11043)|
| 3:04:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11052)|
| 3:04:13| Go ahead, Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11053)|
| 3:04:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11054)|
| 3:04:16| A couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11056)|
| 3:04:18| I think I heard a few minutes ago the comments earlier that we haven't changed the subdivision rules in quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11058)|
| 3:04:26| I don't know if I really agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11066)|
| 3:04:28| This is actually a new development standard that Knox County Commission approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11068)|
| 3:04:38| and our staff did a lot of work to work on how this would be impacted, and they did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11078)|
| 3:04:44| So these type of things can be developed with amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11084)|
| 3:04:50| I want to commend Josh and our staff for working together to get this to the point where it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11090)|
| 3:04:58| and I think it matches exactly what the intent of both our commission and Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11098)|
| 3:05:06| when they approved this PD development standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11106)|
| 3:05:13| I think there's a couple things that we ought to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11113)|
| 3:05:18| One, Tuesday there was some discussion about what's the guarantee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11118)|
| 3:05:25| and the discussion was surrounded around what happens if this development gets started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11125)|
| 3:05:32| and the developer runs out of money or the economy goes to tanks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11132)|
| 3:05:36| and what's the guarantee that they're just not going to stop and not do the amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11136)|
| 3:05:42| and I think that's something important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11142)|
| 3:05:45| and I think, Josh, I'd like for you to address that if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11145)|
| 3:05:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11148)|
| 3:05:50| So this plan does have an expiration date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11150)|
| 3:05:52| If we don't continually file final plats, then this plan development that you're approving expires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11152)|
| 3:05:59| meaning the zoning remains ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11159)|
| 3:06:02| This plan will always show it's ag with an overlay of plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11162)|
| 3:06:05| If we do not meet the time frame and keep recording, keep going and phasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11165)|
| 3:06:10| then that plan development layer is removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11170)|
| 3:06:13| and we're back to square one where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11173)|
| 3:06:15| It's ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11175)|
| 3:06:16| You've got to go through the zoning and the subdivision concept and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11176)|
| 3:06:21| What's your time frame on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11181)|
| 3:06:24| We'd like to have a move in dirt in June of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11184)|
| 3:06:28| What's your proposed time frame for the entire development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11188)|
| 3:06:31| Ten years if everything goes great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11191)|
| 3:06:35| The other thing I'd like to point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11195)|
| 3:06:38| every time we hear a subdivision, just about every single time since I've been on this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11198)|
| 3:06:44| we hear, and it's valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11204)|
| 3:06:47| There's no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11207)|
| 3:06:48| I want to invalidate the public's perception of the traffic problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11208)|
| 3:06:53| There's traffic problems on every road in our county, and I say that all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11213)|
| 3:07:00| But there's a traffic study in place for this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11220)|
| 3:07:03| and there's recommendations that the traffic study, and you can address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11223)|
| 3:07:09| There's recommendations in this traffic study that you guys have to do to mediate the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11229)|
| 3:07:18| that are proposed by this development and the amount of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11238)|
| 3:07:24| You can speak to that if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11244)|
| 3:07:27| Yeah, when we bought the land and we knew what, I mean, at worst case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11247)|
| 3:07:30| you've got zone three units an acre, that's 900 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11250)|
| 3:07:33| We know we're going to have to have traffic improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11253)|
| 3:07:35| So when we bought this land, we rarely buy land without doing our due diligence and getting cost analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11255)|
| 3:07:40| But this time, we're big boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11260)|
| 3:07:42| We knew we were going to have to pony up and come with it, and we're not asking for any forgiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11262)|
| 3:07:46| We're not asking for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11266)|
| 3:07:47| We're asking to say we're going to do this on our dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11267)|
| 3:07:49| It's already justified now with the traffic study we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11269)|
| 3:07:53| but we're going to, as a developer, put it up and do it ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11273)|
| 3:07:58| I'd just like to say I think it's worthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11278)|
| 3:08:02| and you all have done a great job to propose this within the standard that we created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11282)|
| 3:08:07| And I think it's, unfortunately, you're the guinea pigs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11287)|
| 3:08:11| I feel like a guinea pig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11291)|
| 3:08:12| You had to be the one to take all the questions and answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11292)|
| 3:08:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11295)|
| 3:08:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11296)|
| 3:08:18| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11298)|
| 3:08:21| You know, the only problem I have with the developer, the family, and this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11301)|
| 3:08:28| is this is the only one they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11308)|
| 3:08:31| We wish you were doing, like, five or six of these right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11311)|
| 3:08:34| because, you know, we truly are in kind of an unhealthy real estate market in East Tennessee right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11314)|
| 3:08:42| and it comes down to supply and demand, and we just need more units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11322)|
| 3:08:47| and we need more planned unit developments like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11327)|
| 3:08:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11333)|
| 3:08:54| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11334)|
| 3:08:55| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11335)|
| 3:08:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11337)|
| 3:08:58| I've said this before and probably when you all were here last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11338)|
| 3:09:02| but New Urbanism was a, years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11342)|
| 3:09:06| New Urbanism was a big part of my undergrad thesis in architecture school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11346)|
| 3:09:12| and conceptually, the idea of this, I completely love it, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11352)|
| 3:09:21| I think we need a lot more instances of development more like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11361)|
| 3:09:27| that is aimed at creating walkable communities with the amenities there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11367)|
| 3:09:37| and, you know, in the future, I hope, better transit and access between these communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11377)|
| 3:09:43| The one thing, and I, just looking at this plan, and I think I mentioned this last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11383)|
| 3:09:52| the south side where all of the commercial and the mixed use is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11392)|
| 3:10:00| just does not seem as walkable on a human scale or as focused of the pedestrian scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11400)|
| 3:10:09| as it seems in comparison to the neighborhood above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11409)|
| 3:10:15| It still looks very car dominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11415)|
| 3:10:18| If you look at Seaside, Florida, you know, the development has this center portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11418)|
| 3:10:25| and then puts the parking outside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11425)|
| 3:10:28| And then there's, you know, layers of the, as it gets less and less dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11428)|
| 3:10:34| And really, just looking at the plan, it seems like if I was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11434)|
| 3:10:39| on one side and wanted to get to the other, it would be really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11439)|
| 3:10:43| I would be really motivated to drive and offset, you know, just moving cars around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11443)|
| 3:10:49| So, you know, I don't think that, and I know that the process that you've gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11449)|
| 3:10:55| and how you probably feel right now, but I still don't think that y'all are there at what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11455)|
| 3:11:02| because it seems like the goal is something reminiscent at least of new urbanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11462)|
| 3:11:07| from a planning standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11467)|
| 3:11:08| And I just, I don't think that you're there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11468)|
| 3:11:11| And same with the amenities, you know, the access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11471)|
| 3:11:14| And so I don't support how it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11474)|
| 3:11:19| And then I want to make one other side note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11479)|
| 3:11:21| And I heard one specific thing with opposition that I actually want to, I disagree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11481)|
| 3:11:31| And then you also mentioned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11491)|
| 3:11:33| The idea of the assisted living or the senior living being integrated with everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11493)|
| 3:11:39| I've heard of multiple reports of how, as a society, we will put our senior living out isolated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11499)|
| 3:11:47| These are, you know, members of our society that can't drive and often, oftentimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11507)|
| 3:11:53| or, you know, need help getting around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11513)|
| 3:11:55| And then we put them off in a corner somewhere and it's, I think, really sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11515)|
| 3:12:02| So I actually, I really, really appreciate that approach to this of putting different types of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11522)|
| 3:12:10| so that there can be intergenerational living in this space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11530)|
| 3:12:15| So that part I do love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11535)|
| 3:12:17| But I really think that y'all could do better with the walkability on the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11537)|
| 3:12:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11544)|
| 3:12:25| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11545)|
| 3:12:30| You said, I'm not exactly sure what I'm supposed to do when you got up to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11550)|
| 3:12:36| I feel you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11556)|
| 3:12:37| Because this is a new, the county PD, this is the first one that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11557)|
| 3:12:43| And you probably heard me at agenda review say, what, you know, what is the next step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11563)|
| 3:12:49| So with that said, I'm going to bumble through my questions and try to get as many out there as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11569)|
| 3:12:57| I was hoping that we could postpone this another month and have some more time with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11577)|
| 3:13:04| But there's some urgency to push this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11584)|
| 3:13:11| I want to reiterate what Commissioner Higgins said in that I feel like this is absolutely the kind of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11591)|
| 3:13:19| that we should be pushing for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11599)|
| 3:13:21| There were comments earlier tonight about we can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11601)|
| 3:13:24| I think this is an example of us doing better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11604)|
| 3:13:27| And so I very much appreciate that for all of the mixed use and all the different ideas being, as you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11607)|
| 3:13:35| like mushed in together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11615)|
| 3:13:36| It's harder to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11616)|
| 3:13:37| So thank you for doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11617)|
| 3:13:39| But it's worthwhile to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11619)|
| 3:13:43| There are a number of questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11623)|
| 3:13:45| They are about the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11625)|
| 3:13:47| They're about the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11627)|
| 3:13:48| They're about why is there no commercial sort of node over in the south or the north area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11628)|
| 3:13:55| So where shall we start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11635)|
| 3:13:57| Wherever you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11637)|
| 3:13:58| Is there anybody from Legacy Parks here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11638)|
| 3:14:00| Nova, I texted her earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11640)|
| 3:14:02| She is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11642)|
| 3:14:03| But Joe Mack with Knox County Parks is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11643)|
| 3:14:06| Can you, can someone, you or the Knox County Parks talk about what agreement really is in place for the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11646)|
| 3:14:15| and who's actually managing it and what can you actually do in a floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11655)|
| 3:14:20| since it looks like a lot of the dedicated park space is actually in a floodplain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11660)|
| 3:14:25| Okay, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11665)|
| 3:14:26| We'll start there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11666)|
| 3:14:28| So on paper and on this map are the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11668)|
| 3:14:34| That floodway has not been studied or deemed exactly where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11674)|
| 3:14:37| It is calculations of just what's upstream, what's downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11677)|
| 3:14:40| As we develop property, we had one right down the street called Creek Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11680)|
| 3:14:44| and all the oppositions here, that thing floods, that thing floods, you build houses, they'll flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11684)|
| 3:14:48| Go there today, go to this property today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11688)|
| 3:14:51| That water will never get into where that blue line is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11691)|
| 3:14:54| So we will study and adjust these FEMA maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11694)|
| 3:14:57| I'm not saying that what percentage or whatever it will, but we've been farming the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11697)|
| 3:15:04| We've owned the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11704)|
| 3:15:06| We've been on the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11706)|
| 3:15:07| That is deceiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11707)|
| 3:15:09| And I know that's hard for you to take my word about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11709)|
| 3:15:11| and that's where our engineers are going to have to go out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11711)|
| 3:15:13| and we're going to have to readjust the flood map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11713)|
| 3:15:15| But that's deceiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11715)|
| 3:15:19| Right now you could walk all the way down to Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11719)|
| 3:15:22| Right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11722)|
| 3:15:24| I mean, you'd get muddy, but you wouldn't get stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11724)|
| 3:15:27| It's been raining for three years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11727)|
| 3:15:29| It's perfectly in flood lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11729)|
| 3:15:30| You wouldn't have to swim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11730)|
| 3:15:34| So, again, how it works and what has been explained to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11734)|
| 3:15:38| we give it to Legacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11738)|
| 3:15:40| and Legacy gets donations from Blue Cross Blue Shields for walking trails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11740)|
| 3:15:45| or whoever wants to give grant money to Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11745)|
| 3:15:48| Money is applied and the land is then given and deeded from Legacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11748)|
| 3:15:54| with an account with the bank and given to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11754)|
| 3:15:58| Another aspect of this that we talked with Mayor Jacobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11758)|
| 3:16:01| and Joe Mack, Director of Parks and Rec,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11761)|
| 3:16:04| is that we're going to pledge on each house $5 a month on their HOA bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11764)|
| 3:16:10| So they'll have their HOA for their amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11770)|
| 3:16:12| to maintain their private amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11772)|
| 3:16:14| but also they're going to have a line that says $5 this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11774)|
| 3:16:17| and every month forever is going to go to the maintenance of the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11777)|
| 3:16:21| mowing, trash picking, whatever Joe Mack decides needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11781)|
| 3:16:26| They will have full funds of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11786)|
| 3:16:27| So that will be the first time in Knox County's history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11787)|
| 3:16:30| that you're going to have the development participating in the maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11790)|
| 3:16:34| and not put all that maintenance on Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11794)|
| 3:16:38| That's roughly going to be about $60,000 a year for mowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11798)|
| 3:16:41| or whatever they seem necessary for maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11801)|
| 3:16:47| If for some reason there's not full occupancy or full buy-in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11807)|
| 3:16:54| what's the county do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11814)|
| 3:16:55| If they're not getting their percentage for operating the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11815)|
| 3:16:59| then how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11819)|
| 3:17:02| So if we don't build it out, I guess worst case you get a park and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11822)|
| 3:17:10| I'm saying that if you've...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11830)|
| 3:17:12| I'm assuming that you're putting the emphasis on building out the dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11832)|
| 3:17:16| before you're going to build out the amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11836)|
| 3:17:19| Oh, no, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11839)|
| 3:17:20| It's in the time frame where first road improvements and then the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11840)|
| 3:17:26| and I think the recommendation from staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11846)|
| 3:17:28| this is going to be done coincidentally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11848)|
| 3:17:34| It's going to be done...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11854)|
| 3:17:37| Right now it's a blank piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11857)|
| 3:17:40| I've talked to Parks and Rec about what do they envision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11860)|
| 3:17:44| and they're going to do their studies and I think through Advanced Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11864)|
| 3:17:47| and everything, they're going to deem what's necessary down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11867)|
| 3:17:50| and they will have full control of the park land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11870)|
| 3:17:55| Joe's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11875)|
| 3:17:56| Did you want to speak to any of my questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11876)|
| 3:17:59| Director Mack, if you could give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11879)|
| 3:18:03| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11883)|
| 3:18:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11884)|
| 3:18:05| Joseph Mack, Knox County Parks and Recreation Senior Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11885)|
| 3:18:10| 2447 Southern Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11890)|
| 3:18:13| So we met at the property and had several discussions regarding the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11893)|
| 3:18:19| We understand basically what the current FEMA flood maps show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11899)|
| 3:18:25| We've talked about really some passive parks, if you think about some parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11905)|
| 3:18:29| that we already have in existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11909)|
| 3:18:31| Collier Preserve comes to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11911)|
| 3:18:33| Roy Arthur Stormwater Park comes to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11913)|
| 3:18:36| Some passive parks that we can put, for instance, on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11916)|
| 3:18:43| a kayak launch at Beaver Creek and also some trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11923)|
| 3:18:50| So we would start there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11930)|
| 3:18:52| Once we get our Parks Master Plan results back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11932)|
| 3:18:56| which we'll have sometime early next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11936)|
| 3:19:01| then we can take that input from the constituents that live in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11941)|
| 3:19:05| and then work towards a capital plan to add to that existing property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11945)|
| 3:19:10| Before we do any of that, the normal process for this is the land would be donated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11950)|
| 3:19:17| to Legacy Parks Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11957)|
| 3:19:19| It would be developed into a park based on the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11959)|
| 3:19:23| from this Parks Master Plan, and then they would deed it over to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11963)|
| 3:19:27| and then we would take over the maintenance for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11967)|
| 3:19:30| So that's the normal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11970)|
| 3:19:33| I was tracking with you up until, and who would take over the maintenance of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11973)|
| 3:19:37| So we would, Knox County Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11977)|
| 3:19:39| Okay, and it would be included in your Master Plan of parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11979)|
| 3:19:44| and then once all is said and done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11984)|
| 3:19:47| Knox County would be responsible for the maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11987)|
| 3:19:49| Well, it wouldn't be included in the Parks Master Plan yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11989)|
| 3:19:52| The recommendations on what the constituents in the area would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=11992)|
| 3:20:00| in that particular part of the county is where we would kind of have to mirror that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12000)|
| 3:20:07| to what the constituents ask for in the area, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12007)|
| 3:20:11| So based on budget and based on what we can actually put on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12011)|
| 3:20:16| is what we would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12016)|
| 3:20:18| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12018)|
| 3:20:20| So the Master Plan, this park doesn't belong to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12020)|
| 3:20:23| It's not even a park yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12023)|
| 3:20:26| But what we would do is we would take the input from the current Master Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12026)|
| 3:20:30| that says what the constituents in the area want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12030)|
| 3:20:33| and then we would start our development from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12033)|
| 3:20:37| based on what the constituents in the area want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12037)|
| 3:20:40| and then the budget that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12040)|
| 3:20:43| and then what we can actually put on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12043)|
| 3:20:46| So there's a lot involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12046)|
| 3:20:48| Yeah, there is, and all of a sudden something you said made me think about a case we heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12048)|
| 3:20:54| I don't know how long ago, but we were trying to get a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12054)|
| 3:20:57| to include a small little playground or park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12057)|
| 3:21:01| and the discussion came up that we couldn't have them do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12061)|
| 3:21:05| and, you know, would the HOA be funding this public park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12065)|
| 3:21:08| It got really thorny all of a sudden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12068)|
| 3:21:11| So now I'm wanting to ask that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12071)|
| 3:21:13| It's a public park, but the HOA for Belltown would be responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12073)|
| 3:21:18| for every single member paying a $5 fee to fund the public park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12078)|
| 3:21:26| Yeah, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12086)|
| 3:21:28| So when we do the covenants and restrictions for Belltown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12088)|
| 3:21:32| it will be very clear before any of the first houses even transferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12092)|
| 3:21:36| that they will know exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12096)|
| 3:21:38| If I wanted to say $5 will go to me personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12098)|
| 3:21:42| I could put that in there, and someone that buys the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12102)|
| 3:21:47| would be aware of it and would ultimately, if they close on it, agree to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12107)|
| 3:21:51| So yes, doing something like that is legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12111)|
| 3:21:54| We have other situations where we do that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12114)|
| 3:22:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12120)|
| 3:22:02| For the record, I'm not going to put $5 to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12122)|
| 3:22:05| I know what you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12125)|
| 3:22:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12126)|
| 3:22:08| The amphitheater, since we'll stay on the amenities train for a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12128)|
| 3:22:13| is that a public amphitheater or a private amphitheater?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12133)|
| 3:22:16| All right, so that is going to be a private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12136)|
| 3:22:18| When I say private, meaning we will own it and maintain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12138)|
| 3:22:21| We will not put any maintenance on it, but it will be open to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12141)|
| 3:22:24| meaning if someone wants to come down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12144)|
| 3:22:27| Let me back up to the amphitheater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12147)|
| 3:22:29| Our pretty picture was drawn by a group out of Nashville, Music City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12149)|
| 3:22:33| and they put that on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12153)|
| 3:22:35| Even my family, when I sent it out, they're like, an amphitheater?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12155)|
| 3:22:39| And then we're like, we'll deal with that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12159)|
| 3:22:41| And we're like, an amphitheater?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12161)|
| 3:22:43| And then it just has kind of just evolved with the topography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12163)|
| 3:22:46| and the low maintenance and maybe a place not for Van Halen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12166)|
| 3:22:49| I have someone say that, to come sing, but Friday night music,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12169)|
| 3:22:53| acoustic or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12173)|
| 3:22:55| That will be maintained by us and can be leased out or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12175)|
| 3:22:59| for parties or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12179)|
| 3:23:01| So it's private in that it's maintained by Belltown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12181)|
| 3:23:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12187)|
| 3:23:08| If Joe Schmo wanted to rent it out for his bluegrass band,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12188)|
| 3:23:11| that would be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12191)|
| 3:23:13| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12193)|
| 3:23:18| A question about the neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12198)|
| 3:23:23| Is everything in the commercial, if I've got the plan correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12203)|
| 3:23:26| it's all on the south side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12206)|
| 3:23:30| and there's no commercial neighborhood or otherwise in the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12210)|
| 3:23:37| Am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12217)|
| 3:23:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12218)|
| 3:23:39| And let me just kind of elaborate on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12219)|
| 3:23:41| And the problem with these computers and the problem with this paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12221)|
| 3:23:45| is it's flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12225)|
| 3:23:47| After the sinkhole studies, the depression studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12227)|
| 3:23:50| the right-of-way studies, the power lines, the cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12230)|
| 3:23:53| how far away our entrances have to be, how far we have to taper down TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12233)|
| 3:23:57| so many things, so many moving parts have dictated so much of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12237)|
| 3:24:02| Once you start introducing commercial, the commercial codes say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12242)|
| 3:24:06| you have to have so much buffer, so much landscaping, lighting plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12246)|
| 3:24:09| vegetation plans, parking, everything has to be ADA acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12249)|
| 3:24:13| So when you start, you take the flattest part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12253)|
| 3:24:17| and you put it in there, and that's Hilton Head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12257)|
| 3:24:19| It's flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12259)|
| 3:24:20| Texas, Florida, you see these things, they're flat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12260)|
| 3:24:22| and, yeah, they put them right in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12262)|
| 3:24:24| East Tennessee is not flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12264)|
| 3:24:25| This property is definitely not flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12265)|
| 3:24:27| So we are dictated by the topography, and it's separating commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12267)|
| 3:24:34| getting commercial, the parking and the requirements that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12274)|
| 3:24:37| to separate and get two hubs or something, just, it's hard to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12277)|
| 3:24:41| And we couldn't not achieve it and keep everything how we wanted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12281)|
| 3:24:48| I think that's one of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12288)|
| 3:24:50| I don't want to speak for Commissioner Higgins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12290)|
| 3:24:52| but that's one of the missing elements that is really making this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12292)|
| 3:24:55| as he described, moving cars from just one place to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12295)|
| 3:24:58| That's what we're missing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12298)|
| 3:25:02| Walkability, as everyone talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12302)|
| 3:25:04| we have one of the largest developments in Tennessee, the preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12304)|
| 3:25:08| It will be 3,000 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12308)|
| 3:25:09| It's a golf cart community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12309)|
| 3:25:11| The person at the very top, walkability is out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12311)|
| 3:25:15| We see this being a golf cart community, where they're going to the restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12315)|
| 3:25:19| and they drive their golf cart to the pro shop, to the wellness center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12319)|
| 3:25:25| You see them everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12325)|
| 3:25:26| Now, the people in close proximity will walk on good weather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12326)|
| 3:25:29| but we see this being a golf cart town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12329)|
| 3:25:33| Well, let's get in the golf cart then and drive across the Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12333)|
| 3:25:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12340)|
| 3:25:41| And we're scared to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12341)|
| 3:25:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12342)|
| 3:25:43| So how can this plan that we are being asked to either approve, modify, or deny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12343)|
| 3:25:52| it's not telling us a ton about what's really going to happen at Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12352)|
| 3:25:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12356)|
| 3:25:57| Can you talk about we're in the golf cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12357)|
| 3:25:59| How are we not dead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12359)|
| 3:26:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12360)|
| 3:26:01| So when I say golf cart, it does have to be street legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12361)|
| 3:26:03| I'm not sitting up here saying that they can drive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12363)|
| 3:26:05| It's going to be just like, so I have taillights, side view mirror, rear view mirror.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12365)|
| 3:26:09| It's got to be street legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12369)|
| 3:26:10| So it's just like just a small car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12370)|
| 3:26:13| A red light, our traffic impact study says a red light has to go there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12373)|
| 3:26:16| and a pedestrian walkway has to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12376)|
| 3:26:20| So that will be implemented, and all that's in the traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12380)|
| 3:26:23| And, again, that's on us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12383)|
| 3:26:24| It has nothing to do with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12384)|
| 3:26:26| In our meeting with TDOT, we're in the process of designing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12386)|
| 3:26:30| But, yes, it will be a red light with a pedestrian, hit the button, walk, don't walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12390)|
| 3:26:36| and cross as the sign permits you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12396)|
| 3:26:41| Just like Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12401)|
| 3:26:42| I walk down Turkey Creek, and I push the button, and it turns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12402)|
| 3:26:46| so you can walk, and I walk across Grisby Chapel or Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12406)|
| 3:26:50| That's pretty dicey, so I'm glad that you made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12410)|
| 3:26:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12413)|
| 3:26:54| I'm concerned about the, if I caught you correctly, we're supposed to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12414)|
| 3:27:01| modify, or deny this plan based upon that you're still working on that with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12421)|
| 3:27:06| We'll just, yeah, meet TDOT standards, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12426)|
| 3:27:12| I will give my fellow commissioners time to ask questions for a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12432)|
| 3:27:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12435)|
| 3:27:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12436)|
| 3:27:18| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12438)|
| 3:27:24| Mr. Snowden, for advanced Knox, what's this May date that was mentioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12444)|
| 3:27:31| Is that like when a final report is going to be due?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12451)|
| 3:27:34| Because the timeline on that project is gathering a lot of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12454)|
| 3:27:38| some recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12458)|
| 3:27:39| I mean, even if all that's together by May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12459)|
| 3:27:42| then there's going to be months, months more of follow-up, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12462)|
| 3:27:47| Could you maybe clarify around that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12467)|
| 3:27:49| Yeah, we would expect final report before May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12469)|
| 3:27:52| We would like to see adoption by this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12472)|
| 3:27:55| and the other legislative bodies sometime in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12475)|
| 3:27:59| So it's within six months' time frame, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12479)|
| 3:28:03| And I think there's been a lot of good input that advanced Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12483)|
| 3:28:09| that we've already seen that I think that this plan shows a lot of those priorities looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12489)|
| 3:28:16| And so I don't see a reason that we need to wait for advanced Knox results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12496)|
| 3:28:21| to approve a type of plan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12501)|
| 3:28:24| This is the first time that this actual preliminary plan is coming before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12504)|
| 3:28:29| and I know you guys have been working with the staff for months and months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12509)|
| 3:28:33| so I can understand probably some frustrations when then we come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12513)|
| 3:28:38| and nitpick tiny things after you've been working on it for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12518)|
| 3:28:41| It's the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12521)|
| 3:28:42| I do remember on the initial sort of pretty concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12522)|
| 3:28:45| there was a lot of discussion about pedestrian access to the southern portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12525)|
| 3:28:51| And I think you've heard it from a couple of us that it doesn't maybe seem quite satisfactory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12531)|
| 3:28:57| and I understand a lot of that's maybe in trying to figure out that Emory Road crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12537)|
| 3:29:01| and the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12541)|
| 3:29:02| But I think that showing some separated sidewalks from the street in the commercial area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12542)|
| 3:29:09| would probably be pretty helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12549)|
| 3:29:11| I mean, if a family is going to allow their younger kids to go on their own to go to the store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12551)|
| 3:29:16| they probably want to know they're not right adjacent to a busy road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12556)|
| 3:29:21| So having kind of a safer crossway area would be something I recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12561)|
| 3:29:25| that I didn't quite see in this plan, which kind of brings me to a question for the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12565)|
| 3:29:32| in terms of, you know, what's defined, you know, if we were to approve this as is, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12572)|
| 3:29:41| there's still some leeway in small tweaks between, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12581)|
| 3:29:44| the sidewalk maybe currently drawn right up on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12584)|
| 3:29:47| I mean, is that a type of change that would not have to trigger coming before a body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12587)|
| 3:29:55| What's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12595)|
| 3:29:57| Where's the threshold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12597)|
| 3:29:59| That's a good question, since it's the first time we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12599)|
| 3:30:02| But, I mean, I think we had our conversation with Josh yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12602)|
| 3:30:06| and brought this issue up about particularly the separation of a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12606)|
| 3:30:09| that the commission brought up on Tuesday, particularly on Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12609)|
| 3:30:15| and having a safe, comfortable walking environment instead of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12615)|
| 3:30:20| two feet away from 35 or 45-mile-an-hour speed limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12620)|
| 3:30:24| That would be part of the design concept working with TDOT through us to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12624)|
| 3:30:29| I think if we ask or this commission requires it to be put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12629)|
| 3:30:34| I mean, these are conditions that you should, as a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12634)|
| 3:30:37| either consider today or at the time you want to adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12637)|
| 3:30:41| I mean, you are at a position where you can add and provide comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12641)|
| 3:30:46| and conditions to this preliminary plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12646)|
| 3:30:51| I think that should be some sort of condition, a separation of sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12651)|
| 3:30:54| as you approach Emory Road, you know, not throughout the whole subdivision, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12654)|
| 3:30:58| and in the commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12658)|
| 3:31:03| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12663)|
| 3:31:06| And just on sidewalks, we put them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12666)|
| 3:31:10| I know it's not even in the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12670)|
| 3:31:12| We put it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12672)|
| 3:31:13| We like people walking on the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12673)|
| 3:31:14| Absolutely, this will have sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12674)|
| 3:31:16| They brought that up yesterday about define your sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12676)|
| 3:31:20| The problem with right now on this plan, what's not shown on this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12680)|
| 3:31:25| is the utilities, streetlights, transformers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12685)|
| 3:31:29| And, again, sidewalks have to meet ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12689)|
| 3:31:32| So we can't weave and wave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12692)|
| 3:31:34| So we've got to – that will be a – they'll be required, and we will put them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12694)|
| 3:31:40| And especially along West Emory, we will want the separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12700)|
| 3:31:42| We want our people to be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12702)|
| 3:31:44| We want our homeowners to be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12704)|
| 3:31:45| We do want – I don't want my kids walking down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12705)|
| 3:31:48| and be a chance of them getting scared and not want to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12708)|
| 3:31:52| So we're putting them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12712)|
| 3:31:57| The location of them, they'll be connective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12717)|
| 3:32:03| Just the exact location or footage or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12723)|
| 3:32:06| I'm not sure what to do or say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12726)|
| 3:32:12| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12732)|
| 3:32:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12735)|
| 3:32:18| I want to – I agree with everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12738)|
| 3:32:20| I love the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12740)|
| 3:32:21| I love the ability to age in place with different housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12741)|
| 3:32:26| The only time I've ever – the city has a planned residential development years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12746)|
| 3:32:32| I was involved with one of the residential plans that came before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12752)|
| 3:32:39| And they – for that residential plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12759)|
| 3:32:45| there was a lot of amenities that were included with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12765)|
| 3:32:47| But the developer was asking for city federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12767)|
| 3:32:55| It was for subsidized housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12775)|
| 3:32:57| And so my question is – you know, I saw that you went on the road show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12777)|
| 3:33:00| talked to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12780)|
| 3:33:01| Is there – as a Knox County resident, is there money from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12781)|
| 3:33:06| that's going to help your development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12786)|
| 3:33:10| No money from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12790)|
| 3:33:11| So it would be –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12791)|
| 3:33:13| Can we have some?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12793)|
| 3:33:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12795)|
| 3:33:16| Well, I'm just kind of wondering because there seems like there was a big buy-in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12796)|
| 3:33:20| at the beginning for the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12800)|
| 3:33:23| And I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12803)|
| 3:33:25| I was just wondering if there was something that possibly you might be looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12805)|
| 3:33:30| down the road as far as assistance to develop the piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12810)|
| 3:33:34| We might be a rare breed, but Rocky's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12814)|
| 3:33:37| My grandfather did this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12817)|
| 3:33:39| We never had a pilot or a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12819)|
| 3:33:42| I mean, we're not against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12822)|
| 3:33:45| But there's nothing pledged here from anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12825)|
| 3:33:47| no promises made other than what we promised you all today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12827)|
| 3:33:50| Well, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12830)|
| 3:33:51| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12831)|
| 3:33:52| I'm looking forward to seeing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12832)|
| 3:33:53| I think about, like, Sequoia Hills and how many years ago they developed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12833)|
| 3:33:57| And it seemed like it was out in the – you know, out in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12837)|
| 3:34:00| And, you know, hopefully if I live long enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12840)|
| 3:34:02| I'll see that this will be something comparable in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12842)|
| 3:34:06| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12846)|
| 3:34:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12848)|
| 3:34:10| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12850)|
| 3:34:12| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12852)|
| 3:34:14| A quick question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12854)|
| 3:34:16| Can you give me your reasoning behind requesting postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12856)|
| 3:34:21| And before that, I guess I would ask our counselor, are we allowed to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12861)|
| 3:34:28| It does say in the Article 6, Section 6.80.06,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12868)|
| 3:34:35| that we either have to approve, approve with conditions, or deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12875)|
| 3:34:40| There's no mention of postponing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12880)|
| 3:34:43| So I guess I don't know what comes first there, which question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12883)|
| 3:34:46| but Tasha, you want to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12886)|
| 3:34:50| Because let me check the bylaws against that rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12890)|
| 3:34:53| because there is a little bit of inconsistency that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12893)|
| 3:34:56| If you want to ask Mr. Reynolds to address the reasoning behind it while I look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12896)|
| 3:35:02| Mike, do you want to discuss your reasoning behind wanting postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12902)|
| 3:35:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12907)|
| 3:35:08| So, you know, staff reports were due last week, end of last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12908)|
| 3:35:12| and at the time we still had quite a bit of questions about different standards in the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12912)|
| 3:35:19| and just some discrepancies that we felt still needed to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12919)|
| 3:35:24| Mr. Sanderson has done a good job to try to address those as best he can over the subsequent days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12924)|
| 3:35:33| You see that, as I had promised during agenda review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12933)|
| 3:35:37| I provided some potential conditions of approval if the Planning Commission decided to go that route today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12937)|
| 3:35:48| And you see that a lot of the conditions of approval that I've put in here are pretty typical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12948)|
| 3:35:55| There are some details in there just to help guide the next phase of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12955)|
| 3:36:01| but especially with regard to transportation and pedestrian improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12961)|
| 3:36:05| and making sure that, well, we can discuss this a little bit more as Mr. Sanders had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12965)|
| 3:36:10| he and I talked a little bit before the, or during the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12970)|
| 3:36:14| but regarding the park and condition of deeding the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12974)|
| 3:36:17| But that may or may not be problematic, and Mr. Sanders can maybe address that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12977)|
| 3:36:26| So I guess the long of it or the short of it is at the time of the staff report coming out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12986)|
| 3:36:31| we were still uncomfortable with the level of detail, felt that there still needed to be things buttoned up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12991)|
| 3:36:36| and since then he's done a lot to address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=12996)|
| 3:36:42| In response to Mr. Murphy's comment regarding signs, and I do have an issue with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13002)|
| 3:36:48| and I think if you do read the regular, if you do, the zoning is agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13008)|
| 3:36:54| and so you're not going to find in the agricultural district standards for signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13014)|
| 3:37:01| So I think, Mr. Sanders, your signs need to be in the main body of the document just for your own safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13021)|
| 3:37:10| because if codes is going to come out there and try to determine what's permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13030)|
| 3:37:16| it's not going to be good for anybody, especially for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13036)|
| 3:37:20| That's number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13040)|
| 3:37:23| On the sidewalk issue, it does show on your plans that the sidewalks throughout the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13043)|
| 3:37:30| will be separated from the edge of the curb, and personally I think that is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13050)|
| 3:37:39| It doesn't speak in the document what that separation is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13059)|
| 3:37:43| but I think with the internal street sections it needs to be at least three feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13063)|
| 3:37:48| On Emory Road, I think it needs to be at least five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13068)|
| 3:37:54| and maybe the sidewalk even a little larger to accommodate additional traffic, pedestrian traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13074)|
| 3:38:02| We also discussed on Tuesday the phasing of your improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13082)|
| 3:38:07| and there's really no mention in the body of the text what improvements you're going to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13087)|
| 3:38:12| though you show on the plan what appears to be, and this is kind of grainy because of the scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13092)|
| 3:38:19| looks like maybe a pool and some other box areas as well as the greenway or walkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13099)|
| 3:38:28| It's in the general area of the TVA transmission line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13108)|
| 3:38:33| So can you kind of, I mean, I think it's necessary that we have some assurity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13113)|
| 3:38:42| that those improvements will be made in a timely manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13122)|
| 3:38:47| maybe put in once 20% of the development gets done, you put in 20% of those improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13127)|
| 3:38:54| Once it gets to 50%, you put in 50%, or maybe all of it goes in at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13134)|
| 3:39:00| You know, from my experience over many, many years, and I've seen this time and time again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13140)|
| 3:39:06| best intentions always don't get completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13146)|
| 3:39:09| I mean, you said ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13149)|
| 3:39:12| You know, if we don't have a recession between now and ten years, I'll be surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13152)|
| 3:39:18| And I'm not saying that you all don't have the capability to continue on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13158)|
| 3:39:22| but if the property is sold at some point and redeveloped by somebody else, there's no assurance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13162)|
| 3:39:29| I think we need to have some assurance that as the development occurs in a timely manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13169)|
| 3:39:35| that these improvements, and again, but those need to be specified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13175)|
| 3:39:39| I don't see anywhere in the document that says we're building a pool of so many square feet or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13179)|
| 3:39:45| or we're building tennis courts, or we're building the walkway of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13185)|
| 3:39:49| and that needs to be in the body of the text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13189)|
| 3:39:52| So that is going to be a guarantee that, you know, when we adopt this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13192)|
| 3:39:57| you know, I generally like the layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13197)|
| 3:39:59| I think you've done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13199)|
| 3:40:01| There's support there for further on down in terms of approving additional phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13201)|
| 3:40:09| You know, also I'd mentioned when you came in here previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13209)|
| 3:40:15| that the connection there to the south side is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13215)|
| 3:40:21| Now, based on what I'm seeing, that you're going to have a through lane on each direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13221)|
| 3:40:28| plus you'll have a accel and decel lane going in each direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13228)|
| 3:40:34| So essentially you've got a situation where you have people walking across four lanes of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13234)|
| 3:40:46| I think it's very wise for the county to make sure we have a good cross section there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13246)|
| 3:40:55| in terms of maybe a change in surface treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13255)|
| 3:40:59| maybe a center median that is like a safety zone along the Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13259)|
| 3:41:07| so when people can go across maybe two lanes, they can stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13267)|
| 3:41:12| and make sure nobody comes through the light there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13272)|
| 3:41:16| I think that's also important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13276)|
| 3:41:18| So, you know, those are my main issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13278)|
| 3:41:21| You know, the park down there, you know, based on what I read from the letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13281)|
| 3:41:30| you know, that's very iffy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13290)|
| 3:41:32| You know, I don't know what percent of that site is in the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13292)|
| 3:41:38| Do you have an idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13298)|
| 3:41:41| Percentage-wise, you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13301)|
| 3:41:43| Floodway versus if you'll turn on the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13303)|
| 3:41:51| So basically anything that's in the no-fill area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13311)|
| 3:41:57| It can't have like a bathroom or something, but it can be graded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13317)|
| 3:42:01| You can't raise the base flood elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13321)|
| 3:42:04| That's correct, but as we study it and that blue line decreases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13324)|
| 3:42:08| that size will get significantly larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13328)|
| 3:42:11| You know, again, it will be up to Knox County to decide when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13331)|
| 3:42:16| and how much money they want to spend on building this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13336)|
| 3:42:19| and that might be a long time coming, but, you know, those are my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13339)|
| 3:42:24| I guess I'll go back to our attorney and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13344)|
| 3:42:28| what our limitations are on postponing because the items that I did mention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13348)|
| 3:42:34| and from what I read, and staff correct me if I'm wrong, Jeff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13354)|
| 3:42:39| this is the last we see of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13359)|
| 3:42:41| There's no other role that we play unless there is a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13361)|
| 3:42:47| in the overall concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13367)|
| 3:42:49| I mean, it stops here, and then it goes on to staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13369)|
| 3:42:52| so we're going to be relying on staff to implement this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13372)|
| 3:42:57| per our approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13377)|
| 3:42:59| Yeah, unless there's some major modification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13379)|
| 3:43:02| Major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13382)|
| 3:43:03| And that's where we would, staff and the developer would disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13383)|
| 3:43:06| on something, and it could come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13386)|
| 3:43:08| They will have to submit, you know, a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13388)|
| 3:43:11| to just deal with the design standards of roads and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13391)|
| 3:43:14| but otherwise a layout, but beyond that, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13394)|
| 3:43:19| And I think with your phasing, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13399)|
| 3:43:22| something for you to consider, we have in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13402)|
| 3:43:26| limited number of dwelling units or whatever based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13406)|
| 3:43:30| until a traffic signal is put in or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13410)|
| 3:43:33| and that's something for you to consider if you wanted to attach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13413)|
| 3:43:36| that to any of the public amenities or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13416)|
| 3:43:40| or pool or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13420)|
| 3:43:42| That would be something you'd be able to potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13422)|
| 3:43:44| through COS limit the number of building permits issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13424)|
| 3:43:47| At this time, I don't know what the amenities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13427)|
| 3:43:49| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13429)|
| 3:43:50| I mean, other than what's on this plan, and it's, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13430)|
| 3:43:53| very fuzzy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13433)|
| 3:43:56| I can't tell you other than maybe a pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13436)|
| 3:43:58| Commissioner Phillips, if I may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13438)|
| 3:44:00| no recommendation you made was outlandish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13440)|
| 3:44:03| The three-foot separation, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13443)|
| 3:44:05| if we're talking about sidewalks right against the curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13445)|
| 3:44:07| we've never done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13447)|
| 3:44:08| We won't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13448)|
| 3:44:09| No, three-foot separation is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13449)|
| 3:44:11| Five-foot separation on Emory Road as it runs parallel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13451)|
| 3:44:13| to Emory Road, absolutely reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13453)|
| 3:44:16| Building amenities, I know I can't stand up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13456)|
| 3:44:18| with my family's resume, and you all take that into account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13458)|
| 3:44:22| but my family's never promised something and not done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13462)|
| 3:44:26| We're saying there's going to be a pool there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13466)|
| 3:44:28| That's an insurance policy for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13468)|
| 3:44:29| That helps us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13469)|
| 3:44:30| That's a better mousetrap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13470)|
| 3:44:31| A pool and a basketball court, a pickleball court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13471)|
| 3:44:33| and a gaming area, that's an insurance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13473)|
| 3:44:36| People go to their house, but they love those amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13476)|
| 3:44:38| and we put those in on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13478)|
| 3:44:40| Saying the 20% improvement to the amenities and the 20%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13480)|
| 3:44:45| to the development, completely reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13485)|
| 3:44:47| We're going to put them in on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13487)|
| 3:44:49| If you put that in there, you've got my support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13489)|
| 3:44:52| Add it on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13492)|
| 3:44:53| Tack it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13493)|
| 3:44:56| I'd be thinking how you want to do that via motion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13496)|
| 3:45:01| I guess my question is to Tashi, are we, and I hate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13501)|
| 3:45:06| I mean, Josh, I know this is driving you crazy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13506)|
| 3:45:08| because mentally it's probably a big drain on you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13508)|
| 3:45:11| but are we allowed to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13511)|
| 3:45:16| The short answer is I think yes, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13516)|
| 3:45:19| So when you look at the source of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13519)|
| 3:45:23| there are two sources you need to look to here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13523)|
| 3:45:25| to determine what planning commissioners can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13525)|
| 3:45:28| this evening with this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13528)|
| 3:45:30| So we're looking at 6.80 in the Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13530)|
| 3:45:34| Knox County Code of Ordinances, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13534)|
| 3:45:36| which deals with the plan development approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13536)|
| 3:45:39| When you look under subsection C for preliminary plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13539)|
| 3:45:43| of course the initial action is by planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13543)|
| 3:45:45| We've heard a lot about that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13545)|
| 3:45:47| We know that they've done their portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13547)|
| 3:45:49| So now we're at action by planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13549)|
| 3:45:51| which is under paragraph two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13551)|
| 3:45:53| If you look at paragraph 2A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13553)|
| 3:45:55| upon receipt of a complete application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13555)|
| 3:45:58| the planning commission will consider the preliminary plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13558)|
| 3:46:01| at its regular monthly meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13561)|
| 3:46:03| shall hold a public hearing to receive comment on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13563)|
| 3:46:06| So of course that's where we are at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13566)|
| 3:46:08| The planning commission will review the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13568)|
| 3:46:11| based on the evidence presented at the public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13571)|
| 3:46:13| pursuant to the approval standards of this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13573)|
| 3:46:16| The planning commission must recommend either approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13576)|
| 3:46:19| approval with conditions and or modifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13579)|
| 3:46:21| or denial of the preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13581)|
| 3:46:23| So it has come to you as a body with a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13583)|
| 3:46:27| from your staff of a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13587)|
| 3:46:31| So I think that's within your purview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13591)|
| 3:46:33| that you can accept that recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13593)|
| 3:46:36| as part of one of the options that's available to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13596)|
| 3:46:39| I think that that's also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13599)|
| 3:46:42| that opinion is bolstered by the bylaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13602)|
| 3:46:44| When you look at section 10 of the bylaws for commission action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13604)|
| 3:46:48| one of the options is postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13608)|
| 3:46:50| It says that a commission may postpone action on any application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13610)|
| 3:46:54| or other matter properly on its agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13614)|
| 3:46:56| in accordance with the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13616)|
| 3:46:58| And then number two is the one that I think applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13618)|
| 3:47:01| Any matter appearing on commission's agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13621)|
| 3:47:03| may be postponed to a subsequent meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13623)|
| 3:47:05| upon a majority vote of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13625)|
| 3:47:08| So it would require a majority vote of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13628)|
| 3:47:10| There is a carve-out for final subdivision plat approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13630)|
| 3:47:16| That type of postponement has to be by agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13636)|
| 3:47:19| with the applicant, but there's no other carve-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13639)|
| 3:47:22| That is the only one under the bylaws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13642)|
| 3:47:24| that requires the agreement of the applicant as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13644)|
| 3:47:27| So my viewpoint is that you would have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13647)|
| 3:47:30| to accept the recommendation of staff to postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13650)|
| 3:47:32| or you can also make any other of the other actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13652)|
| 3:47:36| that are outlined in the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13656)|
| 3:47:38| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13658)|
| 3:47:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13659)|
| 3:47:40| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13660)|
| 3:47:42| Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13662)|
| 3:47:44| Yes, thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13664)|
| 3:47:46| You know, I was pretty clear early on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13666)|
| 3:47:51| when the Smith family submitted this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13671)|
| 3:47:53| that they did do something completely different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13673)|
| 3:47:58| than most folks have done in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13678)|
| 3:48:02| I remember a meeting that I was in when I was very young,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13682)|
| 3:48:07| and Gene Teague, who used to be a city council person here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13687)|
| 3:48:12| said, when's somebody going to do the maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13692)|
| 3:48:15| instead of the minimum requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13695)|
| 3:48:18| And, you know, I think we all are pretty confident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13698)|
| 3:48:25| that if this would have been submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13705)|
| 3:48:27| for a planned residential zone request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13707)|
| 3:48:30| to whatever we've been throwing around lately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13710)|
| 3:48:33| which is three or four per the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13713)|
| 3:48:35| on a major collector road in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13715)|
| 3:48:39| that's a half a mile away from a state highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13719)|
| 3:48:44| five, six-lane section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13724)|
| 3:48:47| three or four per the acre probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13727)|
| 3:48:49| would not have been unreasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13729)|
| 3:48:51| which would be the 1,200 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13731)|
| 3:48:53| or whatever we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13733)|
| 3:48:54| And although we would have had a concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13734)|
| 3:48:57| I don't think we'd have had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13737)|
| 3:48:59| inside those subdivision regs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13739)|
| 3:49:01| I don't think we'd have had the ability to go as deep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13741)|
| 3:49:03| as they're offering to go in this middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13743)|
| 3:49:08| So with that being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13748)|
| 3:49:10| I do think that we are fortunate to have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13750)|
| 3:49:13| to Monday morning quarterback it, if you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13753)|
| 3:49:17| these extra details that they're providing for this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13757)|
| 3:49:20| that are unusual as far as submittals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13760)|
| 3:49:23| to what we typically see being a 40-acre park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13763)|
| 3:49:27| to the county with additional support financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13767)|
| 3:49:33| Obviously, the mayor and Knox County Parks and Rec| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13773)|
| 3:49:38| understands what they're going to get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13778)|
| 3:49:40| from an obligation standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13780)|
| 3:49:42| If they didn't feel comfortable with this scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13782)|
| 3:49:45| and what their obligation would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13785)|
| 3:49:47| maintenance-wise down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13787)|
| 3:49:49| I don't think they would support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13789)|
| 3:49:50| And I think we would have heard that tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13790)|
| 3:49:52| that they're not comfortable with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13792)|
| 3:49:54| and they didn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13794)|
| 3:49:57| I do think there are a lot of moving parts to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13797)|
| 3:50:01| that could get missed or fall through the gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13801)|
| 3:50:07| And I think Mr. Reynolds sent out or handed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13807)|
| 3:50:13| for the meeting an optional condition of approval list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13813)|
| 3:50:18| that I'm assuming, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13818)|
| 3:50:20| that he would not have given us direction-wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13820)|
| 3:50:25| unless he was comfortable enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13825)|
| 3:50:28| with what he just said Mr. Sanderson and the Smith family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13828)|
| 3:50:34| has done over the last several weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13834)|
| 3:50:36| in trying to get him to a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13836)|
| 3:50:38| where he's more comfortable with what's being submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13838)|
| 3:50:42| I do think that additional conditions of approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13842)|
| 3:50:48| to add a signage package, a master signage package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13848)|
| 3:50:52| I think that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13852)|
| 3:50:53| I think that's something that for a plan this size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13853)|
| 3:50:57| and this scale, this is almost a commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13857)|
| 3:51:00| So I do think that that would be appropriate to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13860)|
| 3:51:03| A sidewalk pedestrian plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13863)|
| 3:51:05| as a part of the TDOT design plan stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13865)|
| 3:51:09| and that would be, again, I would fashion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13869)|
| 3:51:12| as a master sidewalk pedestrian access plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13872)|
| 3:51:16| that would be a part of the design plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13876)|
| 3:51:19| And when I say design plan approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13879)|
| 3:51:20| typically you would have that submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13880)|
| 3:51:22| to Knox County Engineering Public Works staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13882)|
| 3:51:24| Parks and Rec, as that develops into this park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13884)|
| 3:51:29| with Legacy Parks, as well as MPC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13889)|
| 3:51:33| would be a part of that overall conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13893)|
| 3:51:36| And I think that at the design plan stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13896)|
| 3:51:38| a amenity phasing plan for the north side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13898)|
| 3:51:41| as well as the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13901)|
| 3:51:43| ought to be a part of that design plan stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13903)|
| 3:51:45| And that is coupled with, in their literature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13905)|
| 3:51:49| and in their verbal presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13909)|
| 3:51:51| item number 13 was a project phasing plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13911)|
| 3:51:55| That dealt with road improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13915)|
| 3:51:58| and I think that that could be expanded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13918)|
| 3:52:01| to add those amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13921)|
| 3:52:04| per Mr. Phillips's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13924)|
| 3:52:08| So I would recommend that we add 9, 10, and 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13928)|
| 3:52:12| as I just outlined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13932)|
| 3:52:14| under the optional conditions of approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13934)|
| 3:52:16| that Mr. Reynolds, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13936)|
| 3:52:19| Mr. Reynolds handed out earlier in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13939)|
| 3:52:23| The one question I would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13943)|
| 3:52:26| in these optional conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13946)|
| 3:52:29| he states in number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13949)|
| 3:52:32| submitted a concept plan application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13952)|
| 3:52:33| for review and approval by the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13953)|
| 3:52:35| and I'm assuming, based on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13955)|
| 3:52:37| and it talks about the road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13957)|
| 3:52:39| for West Emory and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13959)|
| 3:52:43| and I would take that as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13963)|
| 3:52:46| submitting a design plan application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13966)|
| 3:52:48| and it would be MPC staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13968)|
| 3:52:50| along with Knox County Engineering and Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13970)|
| 3:52:52| TDOT, and the normal group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13972)|
| 3:52:56| that would be involved in that design plan review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13976)|
| 3:52:59| and then adding in these additional things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13979)|
| 3:53:02| that you would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13982)|
| 3:53:04| about funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13984)|
| 3:53:06| about the density caps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13986)|
| 3:53:12| allowing the time for the Parks and Rec Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13992)|
| 3:53:16| and Legacy Parks to get in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13996)|
| 3:53:18| as part of that design plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=13998)|
| 3:53:20| That would not come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14000)|
| 3:53:22| That ought to be at a design plan stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14002)|
| 3:53:24| that staff would work again with Parks and Rec| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14004)|
| 3:53:27| and Engineering and Public Works and TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14007)|
| 3:53:29| or whatever other appropriate utility districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14009)|
| 3:53:32| that would be involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14012)|
| 3:53:34| So I would make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14014)|
| 3:53:37| that we approve these conditions of approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14017)|
| 3:53:39| that Mike handed out, one through eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14019)|
| 3:53:42| strike concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14022)|
| 3:53:44| add design plan in its place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14024)|
| 3:53:46| add Planning Commission staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14026)|
| 3:53:48| instead of Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14028)|
| 3:53:50| and then add number nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14030)|
| 3:53:53| which I think was an appropriate addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14033)|
| 3:53:56| by a member of the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14036)|
| 3:53:58| a signage package, a master sign package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14038)|
| 3:54:00| to get submitted to staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14040)|
| 3:54:04| and codes at design plan approval stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14044)|
| 3:54:08| Number 10 would be sidewalk pedestrian master plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14048)|
| 3:54:11| as a part of the TDOT design plan stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14051)|
| 3:54:14| when that gets submitted to Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14054)|
| 3:54:17| And then again, a number 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14057)|
| 3:54:20| an amenity phasing plan for the north side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14060)|
| 3:54:23| separately as the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14063)|
| 3:54:26| That would be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14066)|
| 3:54:28| I will second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14068)|
| 3:54:30| I also want to staff, Mr. Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14070)|
| 3:54:34| is that, are you all comfortable with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14074)|
| 3:54:37| There's a lot on your plate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14077)|
| 3:54:39| but are you all comfortable with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14079)|
| 3:54:41| We'll be listening to the tape for many hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14081)|
| 3:54:44| Let's hope it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14084)|
| 3:54:46| I will second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14086)|
| 3:54:48| Now, one possible concern is, Commissioner Newton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14088)|
| 3:54:52| is in the planned development approval guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14092)|
| 3:54:56| authorization 6.8, 0.04,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14096)|
| 3:55:00| it says that planned development approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14100)|
| 3:55:03| is separate from subdivision approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14103)|
| 3:55:06| Planned development approval may be granted first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14106)|
| 3:55:09| which is where this is the planned development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14109)|
| 3:55:11| whereby subdivision approval would be granted subsequently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14111)|
| 3:55:14| in compliance with the approved lot layout design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14114)|
| 3:55:17| And my interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14117)|
| 3:55:20| it could be a different interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14120)|
| 3:55:22| that's really a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14122)|
| 3:55:24| that brings out the road layout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14124)|
| 3:55:27| and any variances to those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14127)|
| 3:55:29| that would have to come before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14129)|
| 3:55:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14133)|
| 3:55:35| And I would, as a former staff member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14135)|
| 3:55:39| being years and years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14139)|
| 3:55:41| that makes sense to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14141)|
| 3:55:43| so I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14143)|
| 3:55:47| Ms. Blatney to weigh into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14147)|
| 3:55:50| because I've not seen any broader language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14150)|
| 3:55:54| that says that it has to come back to Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14154)|
| 3:55:56| and we were just talking about how it would not come back to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14156)|
| 3:55:58| but if we're saying that the formality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14158)|
| 3:56:00| of the layout would have to come back to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14160)|
| 3:56:04| not the development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14164)|
| 3:56:06| then that would ring true to me, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14166)|
| 3:56:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14172)|
| 3:56:13| So, number one would be, as Mike wrote it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14173)|
| 3:56:18| submitting the concept plan application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14178)|
| 3:56:20| to the Planning Commission for just the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14180)|
| 3:56:24| but I also would want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14184)|
| 3:56:27| that a part of number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14187)|
| 3:56:29| that MPC staff is a part of that design review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14189)|
| 3:56:35| with County Engineering, Public Works, Parks and Rec, and TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14195)|
| 3:56:38| to oversee these additional items that I outlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14198)|
| 3:56:45| And working with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14205)|
| 3:56:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14207)|
| 3:56:49| I will second the amendment by Commissioner Utley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14209)|
| 3:56:58| We asked the chairwoman to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14218)|
| 3:57:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14220)|
| 3:57:01| I got it right here, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14221)|
| 3:57:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14223)|
| 3:57:04| So, I'm going to try to repeat the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14224)|
| 3:57:08| get that out there, and then we can talk more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14228)|
| 3:57:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14230)|
| 3:57:11| So we have a motion to approve the preliminary plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14231)|
| 3:57:17| subject to 11 conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14237)|
| 3:57:21| eight of which were submitted by Mr. Reynolds' planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14241)|
| 3:57:28| and then item number nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14248)|
| 3:57:31| master sign package submittal to staff and codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14251)|
| 3:57:40| and then number 10, sidewalk master plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14260)|
| 3:57:45| number 11, amenity phasing plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14265)|
| 3:57:50| for the north and south sections of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14270)|
| 3:57:54| And number 10 was meant to be sidewalk and pedestrian access plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14274)|
| 3:57:59| Number 10, sidewalk and pedestrian access plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14279)|
| 3:58:04| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14284)|
| 3:58:11| I just think we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14291)|
| 3:58:12| Okay, so the only revision to the eight conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14292)|
| 3:58:16| submitted by Mr. Reynolds would be item number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14296)|
| 3:58:21| but we're submitting a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14301)|
| 3:58:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14304)|
| 3:58:25| What else are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14305)|
| 3:58:26| I wanted to make sure that staff was involved in the design review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14306)|
| 3:58:30| and I think you're saying that they would be already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14310)|
| 3:58:32| I think they're already compelled to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14312)|
| 3:58:35| Isn't that right, Mr. Reynolds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14315)|
| 3:58:36| But they would specifically be looking at these additional items that we've added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14316)|
| 3:58:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14321)|
| 3:58:44| Planning staff is typically not too deeply involved in the engineering side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14324)|
| 3:58:48| Now, if there was a question on a plan like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14328)|
| 3:58:50| that is much more of a planned approval process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14330)|
| 3:58:54| we've probably brought into that review process more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14334)|
| 3:58:57| On a typical subdivision, we aren't really involved in the design plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14337)|
| 3:59:01| Yeah, and the reason I'm saying that, Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14341)|
| 3:59:03| is that County Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14343)|
| 3:59:05| may not be involved in the sidewalks internally into this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14345)|
| 3:59:09| because it may not be theirs to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14349)|
| 3:59:11| I think they're going to weigh into it from an ADA standpoint and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14351)|
| 3:59:15| so staff would need to be involved in that part of the conversation, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14355)|
| 3:59:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14359)|
| 3:59:20| Is there something else, Steve, that I'm missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14360)|
| 3:59:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14363)|
| 3:59:24| I would ask that we add in landscaping requirements to your condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14364)|
| 3:59:27| if you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14367)|
| 3:59:30| We're going to be confused on what standards we follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14370)|
| 3:59:33| for landscaping requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14373)|
| 3:59:34| being that the underlying zone is going to remain ag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14374)|
| 3:59:37| and the zoning ordinance would only address commercial against residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14377)|
| 3:59:42| So maybe adding something that landscaping requirements we would follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14382)|
| 3:59:48| I think they've got that in there, don't they, Mr. Sanderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14388)|
| 3:59:53| So, I mean, everything that's in here they have to comply with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14393)|
| 3:59:57| If it's not in here, then the underlying zoning requirements don't apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14397)|
| 4:00:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14404)|
| 4:00:05| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14405)|
| 4:00:07| I would concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14407)|
| 4:00:08| I would concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14408)|
| 4:00:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14410)|
| 4:00:11| So let's get back to this number one amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14411)|
| 4:00:13| So we're submitting a concept plan for staff review, engineering review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14413)|
| 4:00:24| The concept plan will be reviewed and approved by planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14424)|
| 4:00:27| and then there will be additional staff review of the other components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14427)|
| 4:00:33| Additional staff review of design review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14433)|
| 4:00:39| You got that, Ms. Karen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14439)|
| 4:00:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14444)|
| 4:00:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14446)|
| 4:00:47| So we have a motion by Vice Chair Uten, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14447)|
| 4:00:53| Seconded by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14453)|
| 4:00:56| On the A4CED 11 conditions, and we have much discussion remaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14456)|
| 4:01:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14464)|
| 4:01:05| So let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14465)|
| 4:01:09| Let's just go down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14469)|
| 4:01:10| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14470)|
| 4:01:12| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14472)|
| 4:01:14| I'm in support of this motion, and I am really in support of the concept of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14474)|
| 4:01:21| I just want to, as a final word, really encourage a second look at the commercial mixed-use area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14481)|
| 4:01:32| even if you have to come back for a major modification approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14492)|
| 4:01:37| I really think that it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14497)|
| 4:01:40| It could be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14500)|
| 4:01:41| It could be awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14501)|
| 4:01:43| And so just my final thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14503)|
| 4:01:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14508)|
| 4:01:49| Commissioner Schell, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14509)|
| 4:01:51| Condition number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14511)|
| 4:01:53| So they have to come back to us for a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14513)|
| 4:01:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14517)|
| 4:01:58| I mean, what's the difference than just postponing if we're sitting here trying to figure this out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14518)|
| 4:02:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14526)|
| 4:02:07| And we're a little uncertain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14527)|
| 4:02:08| So a concept plan is really the final road design that has the horizontal curves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14528)|
| 4:02:16| the vertical curve information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14536)|
| 4:02:17| If there's variances that are required to the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14537)|
| 4:02:20| then that's when that would be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14540)|
| 4:02:23| So it's really looking at the road improvements and the general lot layouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14543)|
| 4:02:30| After the concept plan approval, there could still be some minor tweaks to the road layout in the lot line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14550)|
| 4:02:38| in the lot layout, but really that's setting what the road design is at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14558)|
| 4:02:43| And that gets back to what Jeff was citing, the subdivision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14563)|
| 4:02:48| The concept plan is the subdivision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14568)|
| 4:02:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14571)|
| 4:02:52| I mean, this allows him to put in the investment time to develop all the road profiles and drainage and all easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14572)|
| 4:02:59| and evaluate sinkholes so that he can develop that final subdivision concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14579)|
| 4:03:04| I'm kind of on the fence with this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14584)|
| 4:03:06| We've uncovered missing pieces today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14586)|
| 4:03:11| What else could we be missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14591)|
| 4:03:14| I know this is a long-term project that's going to last 10 years plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14594)|
| 4:03:18| It could have a different owner at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14598)|
| 4:03:21| Are we comfortable with the document as is with what we just figured out is missing tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14601)|
| 4:03:27| I don't know, but I don't want to, you know, seven years from now realize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14607)|
| 4:03:30| oh yeah, we didn't think of that then yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14610)|
| 4:03:32| That's why it's the way it is, because it got sold off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14612)|
| 4:03:36| I know that's not an intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14616)|
| 4:03:38| So I'm just kind of on the fence with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14618)|
| 4:03:40| I feel like we're kind of pushing some things through on a 10-year plan to get something done a month sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14620)|
| 4:03:51| I hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14631)|
| 4:03:52| I don't know when we'll ever know for sure, and I think we passed the multi-use stadium without discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14632)|
| 4:03:59| That had a sign planted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14639)|
| 4:04:00| But I do get what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14640)|
| 4:04:01| You're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14641)|
| 4:04:02| So I'm not disagreeing with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14642)|
| 4:04:05| Ms. Warner, do you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14645)|
| 4:04:08| It's actually me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14648)|
| 4:04:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14649)|
| 4:04:10| Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14650)|
| 4:04:11| I think I got shifted a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14651)|
| 4:04:13| And just for the benefit of the audience that's here, I think it would be good just to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14653)|
| 4:04:17| I can go over what the conditions are, because I know we've touched on a couple of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14657)|
| 4:04:22| but not everybody may know what those conditions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14662)|
| 4:04:28| And so if you don't mind, is it okay if I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14668)|
| 4:04:32| And so if you don't mind, is it okay if I just run through a quick summary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14672)|
| 4:04:36| We've already talked about condition number one, which is bringing back the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14676)|
| 4:04:41| as well as the amendment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14681)|
| 4:04:44| Condition number two is this related to the transportation impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14684)|
| 4:04:49| outlining what the developer is responsible for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14689)|
| 4:04:52| making sure that the TIS is revised as needed to match the plan development proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14692)|
| 4:05:01| and also outlining any shared costs that might be associated with improvements at Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14701)|
| 4:05:11| Number three is amending their project phasing plan in section 13| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14711)|
| 4:05:19| to clarify the developer will provide funding towards improvements at West Emory Road and Clinton Highway intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14719)|
| 4:05:26| Number four is amending section 3.2, density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14726)|
| 4:05:30| proposed density to state that there be no more than 1,200 residential dwelling units in areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14730)|
| 4:05:35| designated single-family, townhouse, and multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14735)|
| 4:05:38| and to clarify, each residential area shall not exceed the maximum densities as presented in 7.2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14738)|
| 4:05:45| proposed density, and section 7.3, proposed land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14745)|
| 4:05:52| Number five, and this is one that Mr. Sanderson may want to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14752)|
| 4:05:57| dealing with the deeding of the park and timing of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14757)|
| 4:06:01| and whether it's a condition or not as part of this approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14761)|
| 4:06:05| You might want to just address it if it can stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14765)|
| 4:06:08| or if it needs to just be amended at county commission instead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14768)|
| 4:06:11| that can also be a potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14771)|
| 4:06:16| It's been brought to my attention that if you're required to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14776)|
| 4:06:22| donate, it's not a donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14782)|
| 4:06:24| So making a number five says we are requiring you to deed this park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14784)|
| 4:06:30| and it's just maybe just the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14790)|
| 4:06:32| and it's something above my head that some tax attorney or something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14792)|
| 4:06:37| but if it's okay, I don't know, it's a moving target,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14797)|
| 4:06:43| but we can get it sniffed in the butt by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14803)|
| 4:06:46| Yeah, and the intent is just to try to nail down that that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14806)|
| 4:06:50| that the donation of the park happens and with timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14810)|
| 4:06:55| So whether it's, as I have written in the recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14815)|
| 4:07:00| or if it gets amended at the next level at county commission, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14820)|
| 4:07:05| But the intent is just to try to nail down that, yes, that will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14825)|
| 4:07:11| Number six gives us a typical meeting the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14831)|
| 4:07:16| of Knox County Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14836)|
| 4:07:18| Number seven, meeting all applicable requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14838)|
| 4:07:20| of Knox County Parks and Recreation regarding the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14840)|
| 4:07:23| and then obtaining all necessary permits from TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14843)|
| 4:07:27| as part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14847)|
| 4:07:31| Thank you, Mr. Reynolds, for spilling that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14851)|
| 4:07:34| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14854)|
| 4:07:37| If I'm understanding correctly, we won't get to see the sign plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14857)|
| 4:07:43| Planning commission won't get to see the sign plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14863)|
| 4:07:47| As if it's part of the final plan submittal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14867)|
| 4:07:50| it would not, at least as the regulations are spelled out, we would not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14870)|
| 4:07:55| but you could, again, ask for that as a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14875)|
| 4:07:58| that you want to see the sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14878)|
| 4:08:00| I think it's open for you to request it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14880)|
| 4:08:03| I don't know at what phase that gets done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14883)|
| 4:08:06| but I definitely am glad that motion got changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14886)|
| 4:08:10| so that we're seeing the concept plan retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14890)|
| 4:08:13| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14893)|
| 4:08:14| But I would really like to be able to see the sign plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14894)|
| 4:08:17| I don't know if those are done at the exact same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14897)|
| 4:08:19| We would narrow and see those separately, I think, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14899)|
| 4:08:25| A large development or a shopping center plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14905)|
| 4:08:28| we would see that separately, wouldn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14908)|
| 4:08:31| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14911)|
| 4:08:36| It depends on the zone district, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14916)|
| 4:08:39| I think in this case it might be a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14919)|
| 4:08:42| to just require a master sign plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14922)|
| 4:08:45| through the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14925)|
| 4:08:48| That way it gets brought back to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14928)|
| 4:08:51| and can be approved separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14931)|
| 4:08:53| It doesn't have to be approved as part of the final plan necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14933)|
| 4:08:57| but it can be approved as they get to that part of the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14937)|
| 4:09:00| the commercial phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14940)|
| 4:09:01| Because really the residential part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14941)|
| 4:09:03| is going to be typical residential signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14943)|
| 4:09:07| which might be a neighborhood sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14947)|
| 4:09:09| and what you would normally see in a neighborhood anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14949)|
| 4:09:12| It's really the commercial part that we'd be talking about, signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14952)|
| 4:09:20| If we can see the master sign plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14960)|
| 4:09:23| as part of use on review, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14963)|
| 4:09:25| I just would like to be able to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14965)|
| 4:09:31| I'm looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14971)|
| 4:09:33| Tell me where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14973)|
| 4:09:37| It's part of your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14977)|
| 4:09:38| He said that a sign plan would be provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14978)|
| 4:09:40| but it wouldn't necessarily come back to planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14980)|
| 4:09:42| Yeah, staffing code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14982)|
| 4:09:46| Vice Chair Uten, are you willing to amend your motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14986)|
| 4:09:50| to include that we see that under use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14990)|
| 4:09:56| I'm assuming that I would need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=14996)|
| 4:10:04| So that would be a concurrent thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15004)|
| 4:10:08| I'm assuming, Mr. Sanderson, as you submit the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15008)|
| 4:10:11| Yeah, that's really boring reading going through the sign plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15011)|
| 4:10:16| So we will come up with something and present it to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15016)|
| 4:10:18| but it will be tastefully done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15018)|
| 4:10:20| We have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15020)|
| 4:10:23| So that might be a little bit difficult to do up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15023)|
| 4:10:35| Can it be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15035)|
| 4:10:36| I'm comfortable with it following in the natural order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15036)|
| 4:10:40| that he would be developing it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15040)|
| 4:10:42| I'm not trying to make it more burdensome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15042)|
| 4:10:44| I'm thinking longer term in terms of PD for the county precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15044)|
| 4:10:50| I think it would be good for us to be able to review that sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15050)|
| 4:10:54| I think there's some merit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15054)|
| 4:10:57| Let me ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15057)|
| 4:10:58| If we present a sign plan and you all say no to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15058)|
| 4:11:03| is that saying no to the entire plan development application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15063)|
| 4:11:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15067)|
| 4:11:08| Specifically, you'd be doing a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15068)|
| 4:11:11| specifically to submit the master sign package for the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15071)|
| 4:11:17| Same with the sidewalk and same with the pedestrian access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15077)|
| 4:11:20| Maybe, Josh, too, the landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15080)|
| 4:11:23| I think for the commercial area, I think it would be wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15083)|
| 4:11:26| We're talking about the south side, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15086)|
| 4:11:29| Don't we need landscape standards for the south side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15089)|
| 4:11:33| That's what I just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15093)|
| 4:11:34| It's in the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15094)|
| 4:11:36| The south side is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15096)|
| 4:11:38| It talks about a few trees but nothing about shrubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15098)|
| 4:11:41| Yeah, again, trying to plan it out where utilities and sidewalks and spacing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15101)|
| 4:11:47| I took the commercial's neighborhood zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15107)|
| 4:11:51| took that language and added to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15111)|
| 4:11:59| Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15119)|
| 4:12:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15120)|
| 4:12:01| Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15121)|
| 4:12:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15122)|
| 4:12:07| This plan development zone that we created, we created it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15127)|
| 4:12:14| I don't know how long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15134)|
| 4:12:16| and we had these steps that we put in the plan to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15136)|
| 4:12:21| And so far, I heard the argument for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15141)|
| 4:12:27| This thing has been through the pre-consulting application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15147)|
| 4:12:31| It brought the concept plan before us a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15151)|
| 4:12:35| Now we're in the preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15155)|
| 4:12:37| And I'll stress the word preliminary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15157)|
| 4:12:41| That's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15161)|
| 4:12:42| There's still a lot of work to be done between approval of the preliminary plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15162)|
| 4:12:46| and the final plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15166)|
| 4:12:48| And there's work to be done by the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15168)|
| 4:12:52| because it still has to go to them for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15172)|
| 4:12:54| And I'm sure, I don't know how many people are on the commission on the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15174)|
| 4:12:58| but we've got 15 here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15178)|
| 4:13:00| and there's 15 different ideas of what probably should be involved in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15180)|
| 4:13:04| that are not spelled out in this plan that we developed before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15184)|
| 4:13:08| But that's part of this plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15188)|
| 4:13:11| So I don't think postponing the preliminary plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15191)|
| 4:13:15| is something that's appropriate for us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15195)|
| 4:13:18| On top of what county commission may have input on when it goes before them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15198)|
| 4:13:24| it comes back to our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15204)|
| 4:13:27| And staff has to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15207)|
| 4:13:29| okay, this is the spirit of what commission approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15209)|
| 4:13:35| If they disagree, it comes back to us anyway with a new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15215)|
| 4:13:40| So there's numerous steps between now and the time they start digging dirt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15220)|
| 4:13:45| that there's opportunity for input and opportunity for improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15225)|
| 4:13:50| I don't think 30 days for one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15230)|
| 4:13:53| We've been talking about it for two and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15233)|
| 4:13:56| We talked about it Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15236)|
| 4:13:57| We talked about it last time last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15237)|
| 4:14:00| That gave us opportunity to have input into what went on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15240)|
| 4:14:03| what's going on with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15243)|
| 4:14:05| And I think it's a great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15245)|
| 4:14:07| I think it is within the realm of the plan development ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15247)|
| 4:14:12| And I think it's time for us to say, based on the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15252)|
| 4:14:16| I'm going to support this motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15256)|
| 4:14:18| and hopefully move forward and see how this thing transpires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15258)|
| 4:14:24| when it comes back to staff to make sure that it's within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15264)|
| 4:14:29| And as far as that pedestrian access and all that, I believe, well, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15269)|
| 4:14:35| I know that engineering is going to have a lot of input into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15275)|
| 4:14:40| It says right here in our actions that staff has to work with engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15280)|
| 4:14:47| to make sure everything is the way it's supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15287)|
| 4:14:51| So I think it's time for us as a commission to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15291)|
| 4:14:55| I think what we've created is a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15295)|
| 4:14:58| and I think it's working the way we intended it to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15298)|
| 4:15:03| And it may need to be tweaked as we move on down the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15303)|
| 4:15:07| but I think that we have those opportunities to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15307)|
| 4:15:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15310)|
| 4:15:12| All right, we have a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15312)|
| 4:15:14| I do have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15314)|
| 4:15:16| One, I'm going to support this, but this is a broader question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15316)|
| 4:15:20| not specific to this plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15320)|
| 4:15:23| And, Mr. Reynolds, you may or may not be able to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15323)|
| 4:15:26| And to the public, if it looks like we're learning on the job, here we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15326)|
| 4:15:30| because this is a new designation, so bear with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15330)|
| 4:15:36| If we see a future development come in under plan development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15336)|
| 4:15:40| and we give exceptions because we might like the amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15340)|
| 4:15:47| and the amenities don't get built out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15347)|
| 4:15:53| I don't know if engineering has the ability to require a bond for the whole development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15353)|
| 4:15:59| but let's say the commercial doesn't get built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15359)|
| 4:16:04| And I read kind of the consequence in the ordinance here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15364)|
| 4:16:13| and it says violation of any condition is a violation of this code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15373)|
| 4:16:18| and constitutes grounds for revocation of all approvals granted for the plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15378)|
| 4:16:25| But let's say we're into this thing 75%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15385)|
| 4:16:30| I mean, what are you revoking that's been, what do you do with what's been built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15390)|
| 4:16:35| That's a question for anybody that can answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15395)|
| 4:16:39| Tear it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15399)|
| 4:16:43| I'm assuming anything that's been built at that point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15403)|
| 4:16:46| would then become a nonconforming use, so it can remain as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15406)|
| 4:16:52| It just can't modify it or expand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15412)|
| 4:16:56| So if it's built, and so the rest of the development would just have to go back to the base zone at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15416)|
| 4:17:03| or request a rezoning to do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15423)|
| 4:17:08| But whatever's built at that moment in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15428)|
| 4:17:11| So in a case where a future developer builds out all of his high-density, let's say residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15431)|
| 4:17:18| and he leaves the promises to the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15438)|
| 4:17:24| I just don't see a consequence there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15444)|
| 4:17:27| I guess are you more concerned about the public benefit part of the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15447)|
| 4:17:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15450)|
| 4:17:31| I think that's where we're condition number five, which was dealing with deeding the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15451)|
| 4:17:36| which was the primary public benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15456)|
| 4:17:39| And I get that in this case, but if we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15459)|
| 4:17:42| I think that's where we've just got to be really careful on phasing a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15462)|
| 4:17:45| or something along those lines, just making sure that if the public benefit is part of the constructed development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15465)|
| 4:17:53| that that constructed park gets phased appropriately and not just left to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15473)|
| 4:18:01| So I guess advice to this body is that we make sure that we put those conditions in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15481)|
| 4:18:06| as we move forward with plan development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15486)|
| 4:18:08| if we really want to secure to make sure the public amenities will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15488)|
| 4:18:14| We're learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15494)|
| 4:18:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15495)|
| 4:18:16| I think we're ready for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15496)|
| 4:18:18| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15498)|
| 4:18:19| Before you all do that, can I talk about what Mr. Sanderson has stated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15499)|
| 4:18:26| And there's a few things that are on that map that have not been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15506)|
| 4:18:31| The first one is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15511)|
| 4:18:32| Ms. Fritz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15512)|
| 4:18:34| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15514)|
| 4:18:35| I'm a citizen of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15515)|
| 4:18:36| Yes, you are, but we have rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15516)|
| 4:18:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15518)|
| 4:18:39| And I think I've been very accepting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15519)|
| 4:18:41| You've given me an extra minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15521)|
| 4:18:43| No, I gave you more than an extra minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15523)|
| 4:18:45| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15525)|
| 4:18:46| I'll tell you what I'm going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15526)|
| 4:18:47| I'm going to give you 30 seconds right now, but please don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15527)|
| 4:18:50| Just take the 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15530)|
| 4:18:52| There's a cemetery for an American soldier, which is my husband's ancestor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15532)|
| 4:18:57| There's not one thing on there that designates that cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15537)|
| 4:19:01| It was going to be taken and put between two home sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15541)|
| 4:19:05| I talked to Josh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15545)|
| 4:19:06| It was supposed to be redesigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15546)|
| 4:19:08| It's not on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15548)|
| 4:19:09| So if that's the plan that you all are going to vote on, it completely negates Captain Fox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15549)|
| 4:19:16| which is completely unacceptable because he fought for this country in the American Revolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15556)|
| 4:19:23| He's been there since 1840.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15563)|
| 4:19:25| That cemetery looks like a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15565)|
| 4:19:27| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15567)|
| 4:19:28| We've gone through all these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15568)|
| 4:19:30| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15570)|
| 4:19:32| Mr. Sanderson, if you'd like 30 seconds, I'll give you 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15572)|
| 4:19:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15577)|
| 4:19:38| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15578)|
| 4:19:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15581)|
| 4:19:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15583)|
| 4:19:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15584)|
| 4:19:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15585)|
| 4:19:46| We have one opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15586)|
| 4:19:48| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15588)|
| 4:19:56| Thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15596)|
| 4:19:57| Motion passed 11-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15597)|
| 4:20:00| I know we're exactly learning on the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15600)|
| 4:20:03| The reason I wanted to move forward is to get all you all in the same room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15603)|
| 4:20:06| and start hashing out these ideas and make sure that's where we got to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15606)|
| 4:20:09| But thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15609)|
| 4:20:10| Josh, you've got a B-plus on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15610)|
| 4:20:12| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15612)|
| 4:20:14| You've got a B-plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221208?start=15614)|
