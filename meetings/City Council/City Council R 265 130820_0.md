| 0:01:26| Let's see, is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=86)|
| 0:01:29| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=90)|

| 0:01:32| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=92)|

| 0:01:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| The ayes have it, and the minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=95)|
| 0:01:37| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| Items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| Items requested to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| Okay, we're on 5D, the consent items, that's 11A to B, the Certificates of Compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=106)|
| 0:01:53| 11L to 11P, the Pensions, and 12F to 12I, 202 Funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=113)|
| 0:01:59| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| The ayes have it, and we've passed the consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| For the Mayor's Report, I just wanted to let you all know that tomorrow, there is a Southeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=127)|
| 0:02:13| Sustainability Summit here in Knoxville, sponsored by the Oak Ridge National Lab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=133)|
| 0:02:18| It's held at the Holiday Inn World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| This is the third annual summit that they have had, but the first to be held in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| So it is an event planned by ORNL in collaboration with Pathway Lending, TDEX Office of Energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=145)|
| 0:02:32| Programs, and the City of Knoxville's Office of Sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| And according to Tom Mason, the Director of the Oak Ridge National Lab, the summit will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| have dynamic presentations and panel discussions about energy efficiency, lighting upgrades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=160)|
| 0:02:46| renewable transportation, ground source heat pumps, and funding for these types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| Their ultimate goal is to be able to differentiate our region as a leader in the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=172)|
| 0:02:57| of a sustainable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=177)|
| 0:02:59| So this is an issue near and dear to me and to City Council, so we welcome all the attendees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=179)|
| 0:03:06| from the Southeast here in Knoxville to focus on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| Also on Friday, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., we'll be holding the second annual Accessibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=190)|
| 0:03:17| Symposium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| The symposium is an interactive, state-of-the-art show that focuses on mobility, aging in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=199)|
| 0:03:25| and smart design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| It will be held at the Civic Coliseum and is a partnership between the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| and the Construction Specifications Institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| Stephanie Cook, our ADA coordinator, is one of the main organizers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| So if you want to attend this, I'm not sure if there's still any available slots, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=219)|
| 0:03:45| call 311 and ask, and they can put you through if you're interested in attending the Accessibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| Symposium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=232)|
| 0:03:53| And finally, I do want to speak for a minute about the announcement that we had yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| from TDOT about the issue of the James White Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=239)|
| 0:04:06| What TDOT has done is to, instead of coming out with a recommendation, releasing their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=246)|
| 0:04:14| EIS, their environmental review, they have an option that they are floating a new, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=254)|
| 0:04:20| they're calling a modified green alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| And so they are putting that out and will hold a couple of public hearings, we understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| And then they are soliciting comments on this revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| So I just wanted to take a minute to read my statement, just to be real clear what our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| position is on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| I appreciate that Commissioner Schroer has extended the comment period regarding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| James White Parkway extension in order to hear from the public about a modified parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| design versus the no-build option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| A parkway with lanes for biking and walking is definitely preferable to an interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| design, and I appreciate TDOT's willingness to make those design alterations in response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| to local concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| However, I remain firmly opposed to any extension of the James White Parkway through our growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| urban wilderness area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| The urban wilderness has already achieved national recognition as an outdoor recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| destination and is a key economic development and tourism opportunity in our city, region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=318)|
| 0:05:26| and state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| The proposed parkway will bisect this regional asset and plow through the existing and proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| trail network and wilderness assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| And as I was reminded today, also historical assets are within that wilderness area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| It will divert traffic from Chapman Highway businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| I support major safety improvements and enhancements to Chapman Highway, Alcoa Highway, and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=345)|
| 0:05:52| existing roads and highways that serve our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| We should work together regionally to create the future we want through smarter development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| and transportation patterns, rather than destroy this wonderful economic and environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| asset on the basis of projected future traffic needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| I strongly encourage everyone to study the alternatives, to think of our future as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| city, county, and region, and to respectfully and unambiguously express their opinions during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=375)|
| 0:06:21| the input period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| So that completes my report for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| Council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| Vice Mayor Cavanaugh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| I guess I'll dovetail off of your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| Obviously, the mayor and I are in lockstep in our opinions on, you know, the no-build option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=391)|
| 0:06:39| I do very much appreciate TDOT having continued to continue the public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=399)|
| 0:06:47| I think it's very important, and I commend them on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| You know, in addition to, I mean, there's so many man hours that have been committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=411)|
| 0:06:57| to this project, and it has cost the government taxpayers' dollars very little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| It's amazing what the Appalachian Mountain Bike Club folks have been able to do with their sweat equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| I would encourage anyone to come out on a Tuesday or Saturday and just see the wonderful amount of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=430)|
| 0:07:17| that flock into South Knoxville to spend money and to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| just realize what the urban wilderness has given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| Since it's been here, we've just kind of realized it, and it's God-given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| and we're really taking care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| So we get one chance at that, and I hope that we'll be able to find some common ground there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=453)|
| 0:07:39| So in addition to that, I mean, there's been a lot of private dollars that have been given, donated, land as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=459)|
| 0:07:47| So, anyway, I just want to say, you know, my piece on it, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| and probably have some more comments down in the future about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| And in addition, too, I just wanted to announce that we'll have a workshop, the 29th, in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=476)|
| 0:08:05| It will begin at 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| It's on the Tenova project, if you will, the land down off Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=487)|
| 0:08:15| I would assume we'll have lots of folks here, but I want to say again that it will begin at 5 in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| not 5.30 that we normally begin on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| So that's my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| I have an e-mail here from the Martin Luther King Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| And I don't know if they sent it out to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| Maybe they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| But, anyway, this event will be happening in the 6th District on August the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=519)|
| 0:08:46| There in front of the Harvest Park or Harvest Plaza is the Five Points Shopping Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=526)|
| 0:08:53| 2410 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| They will be having a commemorative program concerning the 1963 march on Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=536)|
| 0:09:05| And this is the 50th anniversary of that march.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| And they will have some remarks from people who attended the original march.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| So I'd like to extend the invitation on their behalf for everyone that would like to attend that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| That's August the 28th, 5.30 at Five Points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=561)|

| 0:09:29| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| The first thing I'd like to say is I want to thank my colleagues for working around my schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| and postponing several issues, although after being back for a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| I'm not so sure that that was such a wise thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| But I want to thank my colleagues for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| Also, I want to announce that we have a signed task force tomorrow at 4 o'clock tomorrow at the KCDC building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=586)|
| 0:09:59| And we are coming to a close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| And I'll have some news to talk about later at our next council meeting, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| But that's tomorrow at 4 o'clock, the signed task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| Look forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Welcome back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| I just wanted to alert everybody to a nice event we had yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| I don't know exactly what they called it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| It was not a naming of the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| It was the Buck Karnes Bridge there across the river on Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| And some veterans groups had alerted us that it didn't signify why the bridge was named Buck Karnes Bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=628)|
| 0:10:36| but he was a Medal of Honor recipient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| And most bridges say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| And they wanted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| And I was actually contacted to do that and found out that it actually required an act of the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=641)|
| 0:10:48| So we got Senator Massey involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| But it was a nice event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| The mayor and Councilmember Saunders and Del Voco were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| It was just a nice event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| I think it was also important to note when you cross that bridge that he was also a member of the Knoxville Police Department for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=657)|
| 0:11:05| So he not only served our country, but he served this city for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| So I thought that was a nice occasion and just should be noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| Thanks for getting that rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| Councilman Del Voco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| It was a very good event, and I appreciate your work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| We had a very interesting meeting and a good meeting, I think, with the local TDOT reps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| And, you know, we can love them and hug them and spank them at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| But they were very forthright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| Steve Borden, the regional director, and Amanda Snowden came to the Cracker Barrel out on Millartown Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=694)|
| 0:11:44| And we had a number of businessmen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| And we talked about a lot of issues that affect both the visibility of the stores beyond those mounds of earth there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=707)|
| 0:11:56| and also longer term what could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| And I hope that we can follow up on one of Steve's suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| He said that one of the things that the city could do would be to ask for an interchange modification study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| That would, I guess, enable his group to undertake some both examination and funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=729)|
| 0:12:17| But, in essence, this would cause them to take a second look some 40-plus years later after that interchange was built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=737)|
| 0:12:24| and see the configuration of those roads, whether two-way traffic might be permissible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| whether an additional exit merge ramp like they have at Walker Springs might be in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| or whether just maybe redesigning how the exit works or the entrance works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| And so that's something that I'm going to urge you to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| And Christy was there as well and has the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| But maybe working through TPO, we can make that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| And eventually, with Mr. Frost's help, we'll have a resolution from council after we vet it through the TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| But the idea would be for TDOT to study this and possibly, obviously, in a longer range world that they live in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=778)|
| 0:13:07| reconfigure that so it will work better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| And, of course, the goal is to remove obstructions and facilitate commercial activity there, which helps everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=789)|
| 0:13:17| It helps jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| It helps the city and county get taxes and the state get taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| And it helps those businesses survive and thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| So I hope we'll look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| It sounds like they really want a formal request that they do that so that they can start the wheels turning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| probably in their budgetary process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| We'll be glad to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=816)|

| 0:33:28| Yes you are correct although usually in most cases if a utility is in the right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2008)|
| 0:33:38| and we need them to move it, they have to move it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| In this particular case since what we're mostly after is appearance, we're moving the utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2021)|
| 0:33:49| into the alley, so it's no longer up the edge of the street, that's not something that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2029)|
| 0:33:58| obligated to pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| You're saying normally they're in our right-of-way sort of at our sufferance, and if they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| to move for a project we're doing, they might have to do it on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| But in this case, we're sort of upgrading the appearance of the streetscape on Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| so that we have a pleasing project at the end, and so we're paying dollars to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| It's not strictly for function that we're making the move, it's partly for aesthetics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| so we pay part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2063)|

| 0:36:16| Oh, back in that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| He's usually in the center aisle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| Jim, I was just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| This is good news for taxpayers, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| You're doing the house cleaning after the appraisal process is over, and you're adjusting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| the rate so that the total revenue is basically neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| Jim, you're city finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| And we're actually lowering somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| Not a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2187)|

| 0:37:11| So, 22% of the total of that rate is for debt service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| That money is set aside to pay down the existing bonded debt of the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| 12B is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code of P.D. zoning regulations article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| 4 to create a new section 5.6 CO1 corridor overlay district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2256)|
| 0:37:45| Move to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| How about I call on Councilman Wallace first since I haven't heard as much from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2268)|
| 0:37:54| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| Ooh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| Mikey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| Well, I want to just say that generally I'm in favor of this and said that at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2278)|
| 0:38:06| I think in all four corners of this city that everybody has pride in their area and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| part of town and this is a great way to express that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| It would be my opinion as Mark begins and MPC begins to get into the details of it that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2293)|
| 0:38:22| it seems to me that an overlay district would, the people that bring it about and bring the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| standards that they want for their area, that they would be able to govern over those standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2308)|
| 0:38:35| in their particular area, in their particular overlay zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| And they would have appeal process, I guess, to MPC or maybe all the way to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| But they would become the governors of their district and they've written their standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2325)|
| 0:38:53| they've written what their expectations are and they've pulled the property owners in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2333)|
| 0:38:59| and I would think they would rule of themselves without having to be lorded over by some government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| But I think that it's a great idea, I think that we will, I think actually some standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| can actually come out of this that would maybe apply to the whole city and I think it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| move in the right direction pending some of the details that will, I guess, will come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| out later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| Councilman Delvaux, we also have someone who signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| Do you want me to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| Let me just make a brief remark and then we'll hear the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| When we had this come up the first time, I think everyone is in agreement that generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2370)|
| 0:39:37| the idea of a corridor overlay is helpful and like Mr. Wallace said, it gives us an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| opportunity to create additional standards that govern that area and the looks of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| and its functionality so that it has a pleasing overall view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| A couple of things we heard both at the workshop and later seems to me require a few tweaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2394)|
| 0:40:04| Maybe the most significant of which is, well there may be two that are like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| One is that it seems to be written in such a way that only the applicant for a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2409)|
| 0:40:16| or a certificate of appropriateness can appeal to MPC if there's action and we should change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2416)|
| 0:40:23| that to have some simple language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| Council can draft it for us, but to say that basically any person or neighborhood group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2425)|
| 0:40:33| affected by the decision can appeal it to the full MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| I think that's fair because there will be cases where there is some controversy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| we should open up that first channel of review to citizen participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2442)|
| 0:40:49| The second part of that is, and this is I think Mr. Swanson is probably part of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| general law, but I don't know if we shouldn't have after Section 5 under administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| F Administration 5, it should probably say something about any party agreed may appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2460)|
| 0:41:05| to the city council within X days, whether it's 15 days or what we normally use for zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| We asked Mr. Donaldson and he said, well we could just revert to the sort of the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| law that appeals can be made from MPC, but I don't see any harm in stating it so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| we have that any party agreed by the decision of the MPC may appeal to city council within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| X days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| The second piece of that puzzle is, and I think George alluded to this, and that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| these communities that are trying to establish an identity and control their environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2493)|
| 0:41:41| I wonder if there isn't some type of task force or group, whether it's developed in the later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2501)|
| 0:41:50| legislation or here that says that there will be some, I don't know if it's a citizen body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| or some body of these people that are part of the corridor overlay that get involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2516)|
| 0:42:02| or engaged or consulted, at least consulted, during this certificate of appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| stage, but those are the things that struck me as the most important things we learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| There may be more details, but I think that's the piece I'd like to see revised, so thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| We also have a person signed up to speak, former councilwoman Carlene Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| You know I'm going to set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| Mayor Harrow, members of council, Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| I appreciate all the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| that's been done on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| I'm not opposed to the corridor overlay or the concept of a corridor overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| My concerns are strictly the administrative portion of the ordinance before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2562)|
| 0:42:52| Three concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| One of them is the way this is set up right now, unlike and stunningly different from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| every other overlay in the city of Knoxville, there is no committee, board, authority, commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2577)|
| 0:43:07| to issue or consider issuing the certificates of appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| The way this is written, it is simply between the applicant and the director of MPC or his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| designee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| In other words, it's quite a private, behind closed doors process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2598)|
| 0:43:24| What that does is totally leave out the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| There'll be no meeting, public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| There'll be no public advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| The first someone might find out, the first notice that a plan is under consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2614)|
| 0:43:41| for a certificate of appropriateness is when the bulldozer shows up on the property next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| door to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| That's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| Second concern is who can appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| The way this is written, only one person, the applicant, can appeal to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| So there's no way a citizen under general law or otherwise could ever get it to city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| If you can't get it to MPC, don't get it to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| You're not getting to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| That's just the way the law is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| And last but not least is what I consider the hostage situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| And that is it says after 10 business days, the director shall take some action, issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2651)|
| 0:44:17| or deny or issue with conditions a certificate of appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| It doesn't say what happens on the 11th day if that has not happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| Maybe you take the name off the Christmas card list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| But it ought to say after 10 days, failure to act is the same as approval or denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2668)|
| 0:44:36| Take your pick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| I don't care which one it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| So at least the person is free to appeal or to get a permit, have a path forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2679)|
| 0:44:49| Those are my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| And keep in mind the certificate of appropriateness is where the rubber hits the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| It's where the adopted guidelines are interpreted and put bricks and mortar in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2695)|
| 0:45:02| It's not a small thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| So I would ask that those three concerns be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| I think corridor overlay is a good idea for all the reasons that have been stated by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| and by members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| Thank you, Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| Thank you, Ms. Malone, for sharing your thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| We're on the same page on many of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| I have several concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| First of all, I think the concept is sound and I like the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| However, there are some flaws that we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| One of my concerns is that we're putting an incredible amount of decision-making power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| into the hands of non-elected people or people who aren't necessarily responsible to elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| So for us to have this type of ordinance, I think we really need to put some accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2747)|
| 0:45:55| to elected officials into the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| The absence of any kind of a review board like other overlay plans has worries me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| And I checked with some stakeholders, both neighborhoods and developers, who would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| And they were all universally supportive of the concept because they think it will improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| the appearance of our city, but they were concerned about the implementation of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| So once again, I'm not sure we're ready to move forward on this until we have some adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2780)|
| 0:46:27| And I know we had a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| It was productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| There were a lot of concerns there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| Some of them were addressed, but I don't think that this ordinance as it is now written is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| what we need in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| So is there a motion to take any action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| Councilman Dallavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| I was going to ask either Mr. Frost or Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| I mean, it seems like there's two ways to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| One is we could approve this in raw form with the request that those three or four areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2813)|
| 0:47:00| be added into the draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| I'm not sure whether that's better or worse than simply postponing until we revise the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| Surely council can make those somewhat modest but important modifications to the administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2828)|
| 0:47:16| section and just hear what your preference is because I think that would be worthwhile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| I have a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| I think you could do it either way, but I have a recommendation to you that you refer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| it back to MPC for them to review this in light of the suggestions that have been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| at this meeting and to review all of the issues that have been discussed tonight and perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| make revisions consistent with the suggestions made or not, as the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| But give them an opportunity to make those adjustments to it and then come back to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2863)|
| 0:47:50| because it's going to have to go back to MPC either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| So it's going to have to go back there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| Because they have not considered these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| So if we made those changes between now and the next meeting, then the motion would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| to amend it and then refer it back to MPC for their consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| So you skip one step by going ahead and referring it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| Then if it comes back to you and it's not the way council wants it to be, then you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| amend it because then MPC will have considered those things and it will be on the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| And the law requires us to hear their recommendations, not necessarily follow them, but by sending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| it back to them, they would have reviewed it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| I will make the motion that we refer it back to MPC to incorporate those types of changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| or at least review and incorporate those changes they consider appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| This is the motion to refer it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| 12C is an ordinance approving the request of Harb White Properties LLC for an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2930)|

| 0:49:07| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| I just wanted to say that to let council know that both parties have met, both the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2948)|
| 0:49:15| organization and the properties, Harb White Properties, and they're both in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| of this and otherwise they would be here tonight, but since both parties agreed, they're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| here, but we're to move ahead with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| So that's a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| That was a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2973)|

| 0:49:36| I think Della Volpe is rubbing off on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| Oh, now that hurts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| He's becoming more effective, you have to admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| That's what he meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| That's what he meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| In that case, thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=2988)|

| 0:50:39| We have five people signed up for public forum and I will list the names in the order in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| which they've signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| James Wilkins, Randy King, Robin Goldberg, Vinnie Anastasio, Justin Webb, what's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3045)|
| 0:50:55| Justin Webb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| So it looks like I think several of you are new to our process so I'll just tell you by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| council rules what we do is allow each person up to five minutes to speak and I'll keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| time and let you know how you're doing on that and so if James Wilkins wants to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3066)|
| 0:51:13| forward we'll start with you and we do appreciate you all being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3073)|
| 0:51:21| And please state your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| Yes, hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| James R. Wilkins, 3649 Tallaluna Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3088)|
| 0:51:36| Thank you for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| Peace be with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| You're all my brothers and sisters, each and every one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| I got home from work Saturday and read one of the front page stories that two artists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3106)|
| 0:51:55| had been cited for violating Sydney Ordinance 1962 about wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3115)|
| 0:52:03| I was livid, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| I'm not affiliated with artists Justin Webb or Randy King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| I am affiliated with Occupy Wall Street and I fully support the hacker collective known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3132)|
| 0:52:19| as Anonymous, which is not a terrorist organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3139)|
| 0:52:27| I understand the rationale behind the ordinance, but the First Amendment requires us to tolerate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3147)|
| 0:52:40| even the hate speech of the Ku Klux Klan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| We have to listen to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| An unarmed individual who wears a mask is not a threat to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3168)|
| 0:52:56| At worst, a mask can get you a paper cut or, you know, get snapped by a rubber band.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3176)|
| 0:53:06| The only entity that is threatened by a mask is the surveillance state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3186)|
| 0:53:13| I realize that that's mostly from the federal government, but we're all in this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3193)|
| 0:53:26| This ordinance needs to be seriously reviewed because, as I said, a person who's just wearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3206)|
| 0:53:36| a mask doesn't threaten any member of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3216)|
| 0:53:43| If I get home tonight and I realize that it's raining and my roof is leaking, then I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3223)|
| 0:53:53| have to be a licensed general contractor to understand that my roof is leaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3233)|
| 0:54:01| By the same token, when the Constitution is violated or the Bill of Rights, I do not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3241)|
| 0:54:09| to be a Supreme Court justice or a constitutional scholar to understand that the Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3249)|
| 0:54:16| is being violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| So this really needs to be reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| Thank you, Mr. Wilkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| Randy King, please state your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3268)|

| 0:54:40| Ladies and gentlemen of the Council, most of you know me from the email that you received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| from me, and you know about my experience from that email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| But just to refresh your memory, I was going to go over some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3287)|

| 0:55:11| These performances have been without incident until August the 3rd and 10th of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| You are aware, no doubt, of a citation given to a fellow performer, Justin Webb, performing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| a Spider-Man and a verbal warning given to me with a request not to return to the square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3321)|

| 0:55:50| While we understand the intent of this Ordinance, we believe it's a rule that has produced unintended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| The broad scope of the Ordinance infringes upon the rights outlined in the Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| of the United States under Amendment No. 1 by abridging freedom of speech, and under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3361)|

| 0:56:27| States takes supremacy over the laws of the states, we feel that this Ordinance needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3387)|
| 0:56:34| to be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| We have rules for a reason, but we don't just follow them blindly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| We look at them and see if they make sense, and if the gut reaction of our first sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3399)|
| 0:56:45| is that they don't make sense, we change them and we move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| We respectfully appeal to you to either amend this Ordinance so as to make exception for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| artists or to repeal this Ordinance and adopt a new one that doesn't prohibit or place a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3414)|

| 1:01:43| when a request for permission to enter a property is unjustifiably denied, in each of the above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3703)|

| 1:02:23| As we've just demonstrated, Knoxville City Code 1962 is unconstitutionally broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3743)|

| 1:02:37| impermissibly infringes upon the right of every person not to be subjected to cruel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3757)|

| 1:02:47| As it is written, Knoxville City Code 1962 criminalizes the concealment of one's face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3767)|
| 1:02:53| incidental to amusement, entertainment, protection from weather, medical treatments, or religious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3773)|
| 1:02:58| beliefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| If the intent of this ordinance is to protect the public from violent extremists who wrongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3779)|

| 1:03:41| I'd like everybody to read it and consider it in your review of this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3827)|

| 1:04:08| And Mayor O'Hara, thank you, and the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| And Mayor O'Hara, Mayor Pavlis, didn't he recognize me because he got my hair cut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| I thought so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| Well, I got a cut for the summer because it got too hot, but I'm letting it grow back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| Anyhow, you were talking about, in Metropulse, about the building a safety center, and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3863)|
| 1:04:34| was a rumor floating around that they were going to build it next to, where was that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| Center Point, and the rumor was that you bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| Well, is, and was supposed to be for the mentally handicapped people, you know, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| ones that they, you know, the ones that are suicidal and all that, they take them to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| hospital and they got to take them to Peninsula and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| And you and the Chief of Police were in favor of that, and I was just curious, is it going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3894)|
| 1:05:00| to be built, and what will it cost, and will the tax be raised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| And then you also said in Metropulse that you wanted more people to shop downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3904)|
| 1:05:11| Well, the reason a lot of people will not shop downtown is that the fear of getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| a ticket, getting booted, or getting towed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| And then is there an ordinance against a tow truck company that is allowed to check stickers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3920)|
| 1:05:30| on cars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| And last one, on special events, the signs, about two weeks ago you had a special event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3931)|
| 1:05:38| It was the Farmer's Market, and they left the signs on the streets and on the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3938)|
| 1:05:46| of Union Avenue and Gay Street, and what happened was this lawyer's car, Floyd's Towing, came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3946)|
| 1:05:56| over there and tried to tow his car, and they couldn't do it, and it blocked traffic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| a couple minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| But the signs need to be taken down after the event because of the fact that it gives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3962)|
| 1:06:07| the tow truck companies to say, hey, we can tow this car because the sign is still up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3967)|
| 1:06:14| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3974)|
| 1:06:15| And Mayor O'Hara, I think you're doing a great job for the city, and also I want to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| you for keeping the recycle program going, and also the sidewalks, and they're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3981)|
| 1:06:28| real good, and also the city streets that are being paved, you know, it's looking real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3988)|
| 1:06:36| good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| And I hope when your term is up again that you run again because you are a great mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=3997)|
| 1:06:43| I think you're one of the best mayors the city of Knoxville has ever had in over ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4007)|

| 1:06:52| Hey, Mr. Anastasio, some of your questions, if you want to stick around, we can try and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| address some of those after the meeting, but I do want to clarify that the city did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| buy the land next to Center Point that was purchased by Helen Ross McNabb, and the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4020)|
| 1:07:06| is in the process, we're serving, we have a task force with the county to look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| feasibility of the safety center, so no decisions have been made on that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| I just wanted to clarify that since you said that that was said in a paper, and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| know if that was said or not, but you can't believe everything you read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Sorry, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4044)|

| 1:07:28| Councilman Dellivopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4048)|
| 1:07:29| It was unrelated to that statement, but I have a question or a comment to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4049)|
| 1:07:35| Well, we've got one more person to hear from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4055)|

| 1:08:06| I started with a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| I was the one, I'm sure as you know, that was ticketed on the news and in the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| newspaper, the Sentinel, for being given a ticket for the use of a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4092)|
| 1:08:19| Now, I stand before you, and I hope you can forgive my attire as it's not as formal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| but I stand before you as a symbol, as a symbol of all the entertainers that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4104)|

| 1:08:34| and many other things that we can do to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| We stand before you asking that the ordinance be looked upon to be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4118)|
| 1:08:44| As we do know the intent behind the law, however, we believe there is too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4124)|
| 1:08:50| ambiguity in the law to enforce correctly in line with the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4130)|
| 1:08:59| We believe that we can be a great asset to Knoxville, and I do as well personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| We come out to entertain, to liven up the atmosphere and hopefully bring more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4143)|
| 1:09:10| businesses and more consumers as well to local businesses on the Strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4150)|

| 1:09:22| and we have even walked around and started a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4162)|

| 1:09:32| as well for an online petition of people that we've only met off the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| of local business owners and everything else that would like to see this changed as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4176)|
| 1:09:42| We want to do all that we can for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4182)|

| 1:09:51| I'm coming to you as a normal performer and person stating on behalf of all the performers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4191)|

| 1:10:03| amended and changed so that we can have permission to be down there legally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| and that maybe we can even help with the legal department as far as keeping an eye out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| for any misdemeanors, any people that are wanted on their streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| We would be more than happy to keep an eye out for that and call in anything that we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4214)|
| 1:10:20| I believe that we can be a great asset to Knoxville as performers and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| However, we need the permission to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4224)|

| 1:10:36| I believe that we can be a great asset to Knoxville in many various ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| And if you have any questions to ask of us or if there's anything that we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| we'll be more than happy to appease you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| So thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4250)|

| 1:10:54| and I think all of us around here, appreciate how you do in Lyman Market Square and downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| and what you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| And so we are, in fact, reviewing the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| I'm going to ask our law director to speak to you about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| I would like to join the mayor in thanking each of you who came down to speak about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| Ordinance 19-62 for coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4275)|
| 1:11:21| I am particularly delighted that Spider-Man's name is actually Webb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4281)|
| 1:11:28| That's a sticky point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| I also agree with the mayor that you all add something to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4292)|
| 1:11:39| And we recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| And I think that everyone who spoke tonight made some points with which I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4301)|
| 1:11:49| And I think there is a little bit of a tension out there between Section 19-62| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4309)|
| 1:11:56| in terms of public safety issues that genuinely have to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| Oh, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| And the First Amendment issues that have been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| There's a real tension there between those things, and we have to find the right balance for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| We are, frankly, 1962 has not been enforced a great deal during the time I've been associated with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4330)|
| 1:12:19| and that's a fairly significant period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| Really, the first time I heard of 1962 was a couple of weeks ago, I think, when you guys cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4342)|
| 1:12:28| So we went to the ordinance and read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| and I believe that there are some changes that can be made to 1962.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| Some of the changes, perhaps, that can be made may be found in Ms. Goldberg's materials that she brought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4358)|
| 1:12:46| But I'm happy for you all to sign petitions and bring them to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4366)|
| 1:12:52| That would be great to see because it's an exercise in your right to express yourself to public officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| and that's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| But I can tell you, without the petition, we're going to do it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| We're already in the process of very carefully examining Section 1962.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4384)|
| 1:13:11| It is very, very broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| It was enacted before 1962.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| It's listed in the code as 1962, but that was when the code was redone in 1962.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| And they brought over from the previous codes many of the sections, and so they're listed as dated as 1962.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4403)|
| 1:13:31| But many of them predate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| And this predates all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| and I believe it is a result of some things that happened in our history with Sevier County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4415)|
| 1:13:40| white caps and red caps, which was kind of precursors to terrorist activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4420)|
| 1:13:47| a sort of local terrorist activity, and with the Ku Klux Klan and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4427)|
| 1:13:53| And so it's a remnant of that time, and it is not as narrowly tailored, perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4433)|
| 1:13:59| as it needs to be to meet that balance between public safety issues and First Amendment issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4439)|
| 1:14:06| And we're going to work very hard to review the law, review our federal law and our state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4446)|
| 1:14:13| as well as law from many other jurisdictions and states to come up with the solution that works best for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4453)|
| 1:14:21| And then when that happens, I think you'll find that we will revise this ordinance and make some changes to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4461)|
| 1:14:28| so that the public safety issues may be addressed, but also the First Amendment issues may be addressed as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4468)|
| 1:14:36| And I speak on behalf of all the performers in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| and even the ones who visit performing outside of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| I stand before you and thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| You have all of the performers' deepest respect, and do not hesitate to ask us for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4485)|
| 1:14:51| We will be more than happy to accommodate and be as helpful as we possibly can during this transitional period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4491)|
| 1:14:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| Sir, no, let me go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| You had your time, and so we'll be glad to speak with you afterwards, though, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| Please come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| I'll be glad to speak with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| That is the end of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4512)|
| 1:15:13| Oh, Councilman Dela Vobie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| I'm going to withdraw my light, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| No, I think that Mr. Swanson said it very eloquently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| and I appreciate the fact that they put all that work into presenting an issue that obviously needs to be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4522)|
| 1:15:28| and I'm glad that Charles is doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| Okay, there being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| Strike a pose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130820?start=4537)|
