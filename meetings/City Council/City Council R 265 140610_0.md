| 0:02:27| June 12th, is the annual business breakfast at the Coliseum, Civic Coliseum. This is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=147)|
| 0:02:34| city's business breakfast. It's from 7.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. And this is an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=154)|
| 0:02:41| for local business owners and contractors to come out and to hear about city projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| and purchases scheduled for the coming year. As you all know, we put a big priority on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| doing business with local businesses, and we particularly encourage small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=171)|
| 0:02:57| We have money in the budget. The budget was just approved by Council, and we have plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| on how we're going to spend that for the coming year. So we will have representatives from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| all of the different city departments who plan to buy goods or services or contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=187)|
| 0:03:13| for services over the next 12 to 18 months, and you can hear about their needs, the department's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=193)|
| 0:03:19| needs and requirements, and ask questions about the bid or purchase process. So that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=199)|
| 0:03:25| is something that we typically have a pretty good turnout of folks, and we really encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| that because we want you to know how we're going to be spending your money, the taxpayers'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| money, over the next 12 to 18 months and encourage our businesses to bid on that, on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| being able to provide those goods or services. So I want to recognize Boyce Evans, our Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| of Purchasing. Is Boyce here tonight? He's probably getting ready for that on Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| morning. But he organizes, he and his staff in the Purchasing Department organize the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| event every year and do a really good job of promoting it and championing it, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| appreciate him and everybody who plans to come out. Okay, for all you dads out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=241)|
| 0:04:07| this Saturday, June 14th, from 4 to 7 p.m. in the Victor Ash Park, our Parks and Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=247)|
| 0:04:15| Department will hold its annual Father's Day fishing event. The two-acre lake at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| park is stocked with catfish ranging from two to eight pounds that were donated by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency in addition to the existing largemouth bass and bluegill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=265)|
| 0:04:32| So your chances of catching something are pretty good. So fishing licenses are required for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=272)|
| 0:04:38| anyone over the age of 13. You can find out more information on our city's website, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=278)|
| 0:04:44| encourage dads to come on out with their kids and to enjoy this fishing event. And also, I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| to take the opportunity to wish all of the dads here and out in the listening audience a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=290)|

| 0:05:25| largely African-American cast, and Bob Booker, who's the director there at Beck Center, will lead a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| discussion of its significance. Then that same day, Thursday, June 19th, at 6.30 p.m., the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=331)|
| 0:05:39| legendary civil rights leader, Reverend C.T. Vivian, will lead a mass meeting at Payne Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=339)|

| 0:06:00| efforts, and he will be talking about the past, present, and future of civil rights in America. We've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| had several really great programs related to this 50th anniversary, and here's two more good ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=366)|
| 0:06:12| that will be coming, so we encourage people to participate. Again, there will be information on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| city website about that. And that is the end of my Mayor's Report. Does Council have any reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=377)|
| 0:06:25| Okay, we'll move on. Thank you. 9A is an ordinance of the Council of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=385)|

| 0:08:24| going to be demolished. Maybe Dr. Lyons? 23 buildings. Actually, I think Jim is going to take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=504)|
| 0:08:33| If you want to get down to the specifics of which buildings, Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| Do you want Sean Fitzpatrick on that? Sean's back here. He can answer the questions. If you want a broader picture of how the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=519)|
| 0:08:48| development of the park is going, you might want to bring Joe Walsh up. Well, I was just thinking the public might want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=528)|
| 0:08:55| know what in terms of, isn't it the majority of the buildings are going to be demolished in this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=535)|
| 0:09:01| Sean Fitzpatrick, Engineering Department, Lorain Street. This project is going to demolish the larger buildings that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=541)|
| 0:09:08| require a larger bonded contractor and insurance. So this will be the big buildings like Waterside, Keller, Laundry, Chota,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=548)|
| 0:09:19| Baker, the bigger hospital type. There's going to be a second package that's the smaller cottages that will come out within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=559)|
| 0:09:26| next month. I think, didn't we also, we came in under the budget for what was planned and that's what's important so that we're able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| to demolish the buildings as well as all the cottages, correct? Yes. So basically we're going to have the park clear of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=572)|
| 0:09:42| buildings except for the maintenance building that's staying? The administration building. True, that one also. That one's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=582)|
| 0:09:51| remain. The chapel and there's two cottages that the state's going to continue to use. Okay, thank you. You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=591)|
| 0:10:01| Thank you, Sean. Councilman Dalladopi. Thank you, Mayor. I guess as long as Sean is there and Jim's your backup. I think we had set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=601)|
| 0:10:08| aside $2 million in the budget for this and this is going to be $1.5 million. Does the rest go back in the kitty or who knows that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| proposition? Kitty? There's several items. Does the rest go where? Or is that a Jim back in the city's kitty, so to speak? I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=614)|
| 0:10:23| would be looking at what other kinds of projects may come out of this. Once you get into it, maybe anticipate more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=623)|
| 0:10:31| We want to finish the project before we decide whether there's any excess. The demolition, we owe the state that, right? We owe the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| state the obligation to tear down the buildings. Right, because you want to make sure you have enough. Obviously we're always glad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| when stuff comes in under, but I'm sure there's many more things related to our responsibilities on this project. So you want to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=641)|
| 0:10:49| and get through it before you see if there's any excess to go back. Is there anything you want to add to that, Sean? No. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| Mayor, I had a question. Mayor Brown. Is there a timeline on how long you think the demolition? This contract's 243 days, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=655)|
| 0:11:08| So it would be January or February-ish. All right. Thanks. Councilman Wallace. Yeah, I have a couple of questions. Was there any, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=668)|
| 0:11:18| price that you got for 1.5, it was significantly lower than any of the other projects. Were there any reservations about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=678)|
| 0:11:25| they'll fill that for way lower? There were two bids that came in, a lot of them came in under the estimate, and there was two of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=685)|
| 0:11:33| them. One was 1.5 million, the other was 1.9. We've talked to the contractor a couple times, and they're very comfortable with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=693)|
| 0:11:40| proceeding. If I follow up on Del Vopi's comment, I mean, this money's being taken out of, I mean, this is what the bond issue is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| for, right? I mean, this is part of that, we're funding it out of cash, but it's going to be paid back by the bond issue that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=706)|
| 0:11:55| going to take out later this year. Is that? Yeah, where's Jim? I think that is correct. Obviously, if we don't spend the money, we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=715)|
| 0:12:03| have to borrow it. We don't have to borrow it. Right. Okay. Any other questions? Anything else to add to that, Jim? If we don't spend the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| money, we don't have to borrow, so. Great. Okay. Thank you, Sean. All right. Thank you, Council. We have a, did we get a second on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=729)|
| 0:12:19| that? We did. Okay. We have a motion and a second. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=739)|
| 0:12:25| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Bell & Associates Construction, LP, in an amount not to exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=745)|
| 0:12:32| $1,088,533.11 for the Fort Dickerson Road realignment project. This is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=752)|
| 0:12:39| Shelton General Contractors in an amount not to exceed $373,338.50 for the Sutherland Avenue sidewalk improvements project. So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=759)|
| 0:13:01| Second. We have a motion and a second. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so ordered. 11E is a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| authorizing the mayor to execute all necessary documents to sell surplus city real property located at 306 Spruce Street to Igbal Bimami and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=788)|
| 0:13:18| Barcott Bimami for $4,500. So moved. Second. Councilman Dallavapi. Yeah, this may be for Jim. I don't know. He's still in the bank here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=798)|
| 0:13:29| As I look through this, I thought I saw an appraisal for order of magnitude $7,000. Just wondering how, we only had one bid, so I guess that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=809)|

| 0:16:43| address for the record, sir. My name is Carl Cooke. I live at 328 Fallen Oak Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| Seymour, Tennessee. I'm speaking on behalf of this. This is a project that we're one of the property owners along Sutherland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1009)|
| 0:16:57| that is affected by this. When this project was first planned, David Massey of the city neighborhood sent a letter to the Pond Gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1017)|
| 0:17:05| Association stating that it was business owners and property owners that had requested this sidewalk project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| When he came to us, we denied it, and we can't find out who actually requested this. This is a redundancy because there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1031)|
| 0:17:21| Third Creek bike trail that runs parallel to this one block away. There's a sidewalk on the south side of Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1041)|
| 0:17:28| But more important, last year when we discussed about it, engineering said this was a $250,000 project, which I thought was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| expensive. He later said that that would be much cheaper. It's now $373,000. I've gone online and looked at costs from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1054)|
| 0:17:47| Sacramento, California to North Carolina to Rockwood. The cost of a sidewalk is anywhere from $30 to $45 a square yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| The most expensive I've found for a municipality was $90 a square yard for brick pavers. This project here is priced at $781 a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1072)|
| 0:18:11| square yard. It's extremely overpriced. We have no idea who requested it. There's no engineering data as to was it really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| needed. Was there any safety studies on it? We have no idea. Like I say, we didn't request it. After I've learned about the cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1096)|
| 0:18:29| which I only learned yesterday when we found out the published cost, but in the newspaper last year at the New Sentinel, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1109)|
| 0:18:37| published at $250,000. So from May of last year to this year, the cost has gone from $250,000 to $373,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1117)|
| 0:18:47| With no explanation whatsoever, that's a 49% increase in cost. The other issue is on this cost is, like I say, it's exorbitant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1127)|
| 0:18:57| There's absolutely no explanation on it whatsoever. No one in the neighborhood, all business people have denied requesting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1137)|
| 0:19:05| sidewalk. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, sir. Councilman Daliboki? Yeah, can we hear from engineering? Because that's a serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| concern. So what's the answer on why it's so expensive? I have to admit that I'm making a little bit of an assumption here, but my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1151)|
| 0:19:27| understanding is that the construction of the sidewalk itself would be about $250,000. The rest is for some stamped asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1167)|
| 0:19:40| Crossings are also a significant cost. Crossings to the other side of the street? Is that what you're saying? Yes. And it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1180)|
| 0:19:55| wide street, and they are decorative crossings. So these were requested. The sidewalk and the crossings were part of the Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| Village plan, and we are carrying out that existing plan. But that's $125,000 over the actual sidewalk cost itself for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1200)|
| 0:20:16| stamped material? I'm not sure exactly how that balances out, and I'm not sure that, well, I can dig into the items, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| specifics here. Councilman Grieve, did you want to respond to that point? Part of this project, it is part of the Bearden Village| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1222)|
| 0:20:36| plan, but it also grew out of the work with the University of Tennessee when they put their fields in, that there was going to be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1236)|
| 0:20:44| agreement that the university would provide for some crosswalks as well as the city. And so that's when the whole project started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1244)|
| 0:20:52| And if you look at the cost here, there are also gym catch basins and manholes that are there. That price is not just for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1252)|
| 0:21:03| sidewalk. And that's a good point. If you're just pricing out enough concrete to fill a box three inches deep by a yard square, that is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1263)|
| 0:21:09| fraction of the cost of the total that is required to build a sidewalk. There's drainage. There is a signal cable that has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1269)|
| 0:21:30| moved for pedestrian signalization. The concrete sidewalks are very small, and they're not going to be able to carry a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1290)|
| 0:21:38| traffic. So that's a small part of this. And any city that's building these sidewalks, particularly in an existing developed area, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1298)|
| 0:21:45| going to run into these same costs and is going to look at the same scale of cost. Jim, if I can interrupt, the actual sidewalks are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1305)|
| 0:21:53| 650 a square foot, square yard. The sidewalks out of this are $18,000. And so you have a lot of cost in curbs, also in repaving. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| manholes and the drains make up for a lot of this cost in here. So that money is not just for a six-foot sidewalk that goes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1319)|
| 0:22:13| May I address that? Actually, not unless Council calls on you, sir, just by our rules. Just hold on, sir. Okay. Jim, is UT paying any of this cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| No. Not as I understand it. But the crosswalks are designed to get people over to the ball fields? Yeah, and to the businesses across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1339)|
| 0:22:32| street from the ball fields. Two-way. Okay. Any other questions? Well, I'd like to ask that gentleman if he has a very short response to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| that issue. Mr. Cook? Let's hear it. Yes, I have a response. You mentioned the University of Tennessee, and the way I got involved in this was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1358)|

| 0:23:21| knowledge of it being planned, and absolutely knew nothing about it. They said if you want any information, contact City Engineering. And as far as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| additional costs, John Cole of City Engineering promised after this was initially planned that he would provide us with the specifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1406)|
| 0:23:38| because we initially questioned the high cost. He provided absolutely no information as far as the specification of these additional costs. I don't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1418)|
| 0:23:47| cost of curbing and siding, but that cost is extremely cheap. That was in some of the planning, and storm drains are not that expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1427)|
| 0:23:56| Thank you. Thank you, sir. Anything else, Councilman Greaves? Unless there's a motion to reconsider, this will move on. Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1436)|
| 0:24:04| Yes. That is in the 6th District, and I did attend a meeting concerning this matter along with Councilman Greaves, and there were also, in addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1444)|

| 0:27:19| think the project is certainly worth supporting, but I certainly often get asked about tax increment financing, and I thought this was a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| clear use of that instrument, and I thought I would ask Bob to talk about it just a few minutes. Thank you, Councilman Saunders. Bob| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1645)|
| 0:27:35| Wetzel, Director, Office of Redevelopment. Yes, what we have in front of you tonight is a TIF project. As you all know, we've used these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1655)|
| 0:27:42| fairly aggressively through the last several years to implement our vision. To be very clear, on the TIF project, we're not giving away any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| money that we already have. What is happening is somebody is investing in property, and they're generating not only an improvement in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1668)|
| 0:27:56| infrastructure around it, but they're increasing our tax base. So what we do in a TIF is we commit 75 percent of that new increment to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1676)|
| 0:28:05| development of that project, and we keep 25 percent for ourselves. With the use of this 75 percent, what we've done is encouraged investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| in an area where we already have police, fire, schools, roads, water, sewer, things along those lines that public dollars often go to. So in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1691)|
| 0:28:21| this case, in one like this, which is a $2 million investment, for 15 years, we'll be going $11,000 a year, but we're going to ensure that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1701)|
| 0:28:31| have this development occur, and that we have people on the streets, and they'll be using services that we already have out there. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| hopefully that helps some. And there's the possibility it may pay off early. Oh, yeah, absolutely. When you authorize a TIF, the 75 percent goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1717)|
| 0:28:47| towards the debt, and as soon as it's paid up, then it's over. Thank you. Yes, sir. Thank you. Councilman Dallavope. Yeah, Bob, before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1727)|
| 0:28:56| you get in, you're not at the mic, you're at the desk. You used the city tax rate before the increase. Do you have a new set of numbers, or just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| multiply it by 34 cents, and there you go? We developed this under the current tax rate for this year, and if it goes, it'll go to effect this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1742)|
| 0:29:13| year. Now, when we move into next year, we will change that rate to the new tax rate. Will we keep a higher dollar amount as a result of that, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1753)|
| 0:29:21| does that all go to the loan? The, once again, it's roughly a 75-25 split. The 25 percent is roughly the city's tax rate, and then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1761)|

| 0:33:05| Yes, Mayor, if we could hear from both sides before we take a vote or a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| Okay, Council, I do want you to know I have four people signed up against this, and three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| Typically, we have, we allow three and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| So what is the pleasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| I was going to move that we allow, I think it's Mr. Tierney who is looking into the purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| of the house, give him three or four minutes to speak in addition to the regular group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| Okay, and well, let me say if we offer a fourth speaker, then we also have to offer that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| So just Mr. Seymour, you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| Mayor, could I have three minutes rebuttal or whatever Mr. Tierney wants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2019)|
| 0:33:46| No, no rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| You can have four speakers on the front end for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| And then, you know how that goes, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| Four people up to five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| You always try that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| The first second fourth speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| That's a nice try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| He wants to be twice there, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| Never hurts to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| You're right, it never does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| Checking my consistency here, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| Okay, so we start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| I'm going to list everybody in the order that you'll be speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| First, those who are in favor of this, it is Arthur Seymour, Ferris Ede, and Rachel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| Beasley in that order, and then a fourth person if you add one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| And then, those against it are Jason Long, Steven Richards, Sally Namy, and Rich, Rick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2067)|
| 0:34:35| or Rich?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Rich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Rich Tierney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| And so, each speaker gets up to five minutes, and there's no rebuttals in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2079)|
| 0:34:46| So Mr. Seymour, would you like to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Let me get my timer going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| Members of Council, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| I'm here on behalf of the applicant, who is listed as Chris Christenberry, and Paul Murphy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| who has a contract to purchase this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| We are requesting planned residential zoning for the Christenberry property as it has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| discussed over the past few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| We are requesting it at a low-density rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| The property has a one-year plan overlay of low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2120)|
| 0:35:29| It's approximately five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| Including the house, we're asking for 20 additional units on the property, which would be less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| than five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| The R1 and RP1 zones at the density we're requesting are both low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2141)|
| 0:35:50| The concern, there was a previous proposal on this property, but the concern was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| the holder of the property at that time did not intend to preserve the Christenberry house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| which, by the way, was built in 1907 and is a landmark along a portion of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2161)|
| 0:36:08| Mr. Murphy's proposal does preserve the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| The resolution before you to amend the zoning map to RP1 provides that the house will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2173)|
| 0:36:20| be torn down until there is a use-on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| And Mr. Murphy, as you can see, and I'm going to hand out his letter, which I think he sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| to everybody, would you hand that out, includes a commitment to preserve the house and put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2190)|
| 0:36:37| a historic overlay on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| Mr. Murphy is not a stranger to historic preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| He lives two doors away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| He has preserved the home he is living in from a derelict condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| Neighbors of his, Mr. John Trotter is in the process of reworking the Doolin Mansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2211)|
| 0:36:59| Sharon Miller, who has a house there, both support Mr. Murphy's attempt by this zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2219)|
| 0:37:06| to preserve the house for future generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2226)|
| 0:37:12| To do this, though, based on cost estimates he has received to date, he needs to put 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2232)|
| 0:37:21| units additional on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| Mr. Farriseed will describe those in a minute, but those units would be below the house towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2243)|
| 0:37:31| the river, not visible from Kingston Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| The zoning, as recommended by the MPC, nearly unanimously, will provide these protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2256)|
| 0:37:48| because planned residential zoning requires a use on review approval by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2268)|
| 0:37:55| If you leave the zoning as it is, R1, there is absolutely no assurance that the house will remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2275)|
| 0:38:03| Mr. Murphy or Farriseed, here is what can be done under the existing zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2283)|
| 0:38:11| There are potentially 19 units that can be put on this property under the R1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2291)|
| 0:38:19| The proposal, and if you might show that with the frontage on Kingston Park, provides for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2299)|
| 0:38:29| preservation of the house with the condos behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| Ultimately this proposal will result in less traffic impact on Kingston Pike than the R1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2315)|
| 0:38:42| The traffic manual says that a single family home generates approximately 10 trips a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2322)|
| 0:38:50| Condos generate under 6 units per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| The proposal Mr. Murphy has will have less of a traffic impact on Kingston Pike than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| the existing zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| Basically what you're being asked to decide tonight is, do you want to guarantee preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2346)|
| 0:39:13| of the Christenbury home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| You can do that by voting yes on the Christenbury-Murphy proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| If you vote no and keep the property R1, there is absolutely no assurance that the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2361)|
| 0:39:29| will remain there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| So it's in your hands tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| Unfortunately we have been unable to reach an agreement with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2373)|
| 0:39:39| They have said all along they're in favor of preserving the house, but they are opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| to the very vehicle that would guarantee that this house will be here into the 22nd century| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2384)|
| 0:39:52| and will be there on Kingston Pike with other houses rather than institutionalized like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2392)|

| 0:40:10| So as Mr. Seymour indicated, in my mind as a design professional, the smart design plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2410)|
| 0:40:17| and the smart sustainable plan is to go with the planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| Obviously you can see very easily the extent of ground movement that can happen if somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2421)|
| 0:40:29| would come and do a subdivision, as you can see in this plan, versus the larger but more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2429)|
| 0:40:37| controlled design development of the project from a building standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| The building is designed to where it is recessed down and if you observe the side section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2443)|
| 0:40:57| you will see the relationship of the building height as compared to the existing house height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| The building is downhill, so therefore as Mr. Seymour indicated, it will not be visible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2463)|
| 0:41:10| from Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| You can see the size of the house on the drawing versus the mass of the building back behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| We feel it is a proper sustainable design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| The parking is going to be, the majority of the parking is concealed underneath the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| and we believe that the building design itself also is very compatible with the architecture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| of the current craftsman style house from an overall massing, from materials, break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| up of the components of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2496)|
| 0:41:44| Thank you, Mr. Eid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| Mayor, can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| It doesn't show in the section there, but what you handed out to us are two elevations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2507)|
| 0:41:58| showing the house from Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| Explain the river view picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| So that river view picture is basically an estimate of the massing of the proposed building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| as it relates to the adjoining buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| I don't have that drawn right in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| So what we have here is the building located between the two churches from the UT campus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| And then the other question I had, Ferris, on this drawing that shows the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| is really just a schematic because I'm assuming because of the slope of the properties and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| everything there must be a number or an awful lot of retaining walls that would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| be built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| That could very well be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| Not much different than the way they develop up in the mountains, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| And what about sidelines from going in and out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| Hey, Councilman Greer, do you want to get through all the speeches first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| I gave you one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| I didn't know you were going to keep going with more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| I'm taking after Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| We're having a charrette here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| Okay, don't go far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| You may have more questions after we hear from everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| Sorry, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| Okay, Rachel Beasley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| She is another one of the designers involved in the project and could not be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| An old friend of mine, Helen Lee, asked to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| Could she say a few words?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| Helen Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| Thank you for being here, ma'am, and please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| It's Helen Lee Keyes, K-E-Y-E-S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| Did you want the address, 4612 Lyons View Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| And I'm here to speak in favor of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| I'll probably lose a lot of friends here in this audience, but I've not heard anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2629)|
| 0:43:58| about the tax differential between having 30 condos or 40 condos or 20 condos versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2638)|
| 0:44:07| two houses put on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| Is there a difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| And we're not, typically we don't answer questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| You just give your views on the project, and I wouldn't have that information handy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| Then I've not read anything in the paper about that at all, and it seems to me the only way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| that Knoxville has to raise money is to increase property taxes, and I'm in a home that I live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2668)|
| 0:44:35| with my two sisters, and we've been there for 70 years, and although I've been gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| for 50 years and have come back in this past year, but I'm appalled that there would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| such chaos, so to speak, about what homeowners can do and can't do with their home, depending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2686)|
| 0:44:59| on their own personal circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| The other comment I want to make is I grew up on Kingston Pike, was told if I could drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2701)|
| 0:45:10| on Kingston Pike, I could drive anywhere in the world, and I have found that to be true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| very true, and I don't really notice any difference coming back after 50 years driving on Kingston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2714)|
| 0:45:20| Pike, and I'm on the Pike three trips downtown at least three times a week, sometimes four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2720)|
| 0:45:26| times a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| I don't go at rush hour, which any fool knows that that's going to be what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| It is what it is, that, but the other times it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| If I read those figures right and figured them for what they estimated additional car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| traffic would be, it would be six per, what did you say, six per day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| No, it would be six per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| Six per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| And who's going to leave all at the same time like they do on church Sunday when the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| You know, they're going to be coming and going and three, four, maybe one or two, it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| all going to be an onslaught there, so I don't, that doesn't seem to me to be a real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| The other comment I'd like to make is about the signage, and I've not been able to figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| this out, and every time I go up the Pike I try to figure it out, or I come back down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| the Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| There's a sign, a yellow sign that has the curve on it if you're going west on Kingston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| Pike and it has 35 miles an hour within 15 yards maybe, or I'm not good with all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2788)|
| 0:46:38| estimating distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| There's another sign that says, there's a curve, it's a yellow sign with a curve with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| 35 miles an hour, and then right as you get to the curve, there's a 40 mile an hour sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2806)|
| 0:46:55| So I've tried to study that and figure out the reasoning behind that, I do understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| the difference between a white sign and a yellow sign, but I cannot see where the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2818)|
| 0:47:05| 35 miles an hour turned into 40 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| So I keep looking for that, and I appreciate the work that's been done on the signage in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| terms of making it more visible in this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| I have noticed that's made it a little bit easier to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| But those are the two concerns that I wanted to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| Thank you, thank you ma'am for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| Mr. Seymour, do you have any other, yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| We followed council rules and had three speakers planned for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| If there's one thing I could add, I had another 30 seconds there, Mayor, but if I'm allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2860)|
| 0:47:49| to go again, I would just finish up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| Okay, I'll tell you what, council, without objection, we're going to let Mr. Seymour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| finish up, because then we're going to have four speakers on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| Is there any objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| Does that sound fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| Will you be happy, Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| I'll be very happy, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| All right, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| Ms. Keyes asked, I call her Helen Lee, I've known her too long, asked about taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2883)|
| 0:48:12| Presently the Christenbury House pays $7,000 in property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| Under Mr. Murphy's proposal it would be $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| There has been, as I understand the objections to this, it's the RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| And I've laid out the difference between the RP1 and the R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| And basically it comes down to the House and later public review of what goes there, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| if it remains R1, all Mr. Murphy has to do is comply with the minimum subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2919)|
| 0:48:46| of Knoxville-Knox County to develop homes down there, 7,500-square-foot lots with 75-feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2926)|
| 0:48:55| frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| And you can get as many, he or somebody else can get as many houses in there as they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| under those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| Secondly, there has been a hearing cry about the traffic down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| I think if you look at traffic statistics, there's not been a fatality in this section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| of Kingston Pike for the past 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| There have been west of Cherokee Boulevard, but for this section of Kingston Pike has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| been safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| Yes, there are accidents, but this section of Kingston Pike carries less traffic than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| Chapman Highway, Clinton Highway, and Alcoa Highway on a daily count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2970)|
| 0:49:37| So it's a safe area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| No place is perfectly safe, but certainly it is not the death trap that has been advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2980)|
| 0:49:47| The City of Knoxville's Engineering Department has jurisdiction over this section of roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| and that would be part of the use-on-review project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| What improvements Mr. Murphy would have to make would be under their jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| Okay, now we go to those who are against the rezoning, starting with Jason Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3002)|
| 0:50:11| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| Please state your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| Jason Long, 1270 Woodsboro Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| I'm an attorney with Lowe, Yeager, and Brown, and represent the Kingston Pike Sequoia Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| Association in their opposition to this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| The association is here and opposes this rezoning because it, too, believes in preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3028)|
| 0:50:34| The preservation of lives on the pike, the preservation of the integrity of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| in which they live, and the preservation of the home itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| I want to tell council tonight that there's no good reason why this home should be threatened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| or demolished regardless of how this council votes tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| The association has worked hard to come up with creative solutions to allow this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| to be saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| One of the speakers you will hear from tonight, Rich Tierney, has taken it upon himself to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| make an offer on this house with the intent of trying to save the home and trying to place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3062)|
| 0:51:08| a historic overlay on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| You'll hear that many of the people who have joined Rich Tierney are members of the association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| They're committed to the preservation of this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| They want to make this project work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| We have no doubt that the developer in this case believes that his plan is good and is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| an appropriate way to save this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| However, given its location, this development simply is not appropriate for this parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| There are practical concerns related to safety that have been mentioned by Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| It's not so much the volume of traffic on this portion of roadway, it's the ingress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| and egress of cars traveling in and out of this property that, as you'll hear from our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| expert in a moment, presents safety challenges over and above what should normally be expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| Moreover, there are concerns regarding the particular design or layout of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3115)|
| 0:52:09| As you'll see, and this is the portion of property that we're talking about right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| this is a Christenberry house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| This property slopes away to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| Now under the hilltop and ridgetop restriction guidelines that were adopted by this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3137)|
| 0:52:23| there is serious concern about what can be developed on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| Nineteen units, from our understanding, is in excess of what can be developed under current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| zoning laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| In fact, at MPC, the MPC staff recommended slightly above three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3153)|
| 0:52:41| That number was rounded up, but even with MPC's recommendations of four units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| MPC adopted a rezoning of up to 5.6 units, which is clearly not in line with the hilltop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3166)|
| 0:52:54| ridgetop restrictions and guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| Finally, we have concerns about the viability of this project due to the Scenic Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| Of course, Kingston Pike is a scenic highway under state law, and at this point we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| know whether or not the project would meet those minimum requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3185)|
| 0:53:11| More importantly, there's a concern about conformity with the neighborhood, which should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3191)|
| 0:53:18| always be a zoning concern for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| This is a map of Kingston Pike, and I'm going to draw the pike with a black marker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3201)|
| 0:53:35| The piece of property we're talking about is right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3215)|
| 0:53:43| Now if you look at that map, and all of this is Sequoia Hills down below the pike, everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3223)|
| 0:53:48| you see that is yellow is R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| It's been zoned R1, it was intended to be R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| Where you see the pink spots, that's R1 with a historic overlay on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| The only green you see in the central area of that map is the RP1 zone for the LaRue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| development, which is 12 units, much less than development proposed here, built in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| early 80s before the association had an opportunity to make clear its belief that R1 is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3249)|
| 0:54:16| for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3256)|
| 0:54:22| The vast majority of residents in this area and those living up and down the pike have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| now expressed their opposition to this rezoning effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| They believe that the area should remain R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| Finally I want to mention that it's our concern from the association that this would set a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| bad policy and precedent if council allows this rezoning to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3277)|
| 0:54:44| You've been told tonight that the only way to save this house, the only guaranteed way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| is to vote to rezone it RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| In effect, council is being asked to subsidize, the neighborhood community is being asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3291)|
| 0:54:57| to subsidize the value of this property that has been allowed to fall into disrepair by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| asking to rezone it on the backs of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| We would point out that that's probably a bad policy to follow for council if homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3305)|
| 0:55:14| in the area start to see that their properties can lose value and obtain rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| Thank you sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| Stephen Richards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3324)|
| 0:55:38| Mr. Richards, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| My name is Stephen Richards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| I reside at 10323 Loma Drive in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3345)|
| 0:55:51| Madam Mayor and members of the council, I want to thank you for allowing me to present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| my report this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| I was engaged by Mr. Long of Lowe, Yeager and Brown to perform a safety evaluation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3360)|
| 0:56:11| the impacts of the proposed rezoning and redevelopment of the subject parcel of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3371)|
| 0:56:19| What that meant is I actually did an evaluation into two different basic areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3379)|
| 0:56:26| The first of these was to look at the existing traffic safety conditions along this stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3386)|
| 0:56:32| of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| For the majority of my evaluation into that area, I looked at the stretch from Concord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3395)|
| 0:56:42| Street and also that's where Nalin Drive intersects Kingston Pike to the Cherokee Drive intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3402)|
| 0:56:52| This stretch is about nine-tenths of a mile and it is contiguous and all similar in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3412)|
| 0:56:59| of land use and traffic patterns throughout that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| That was the first aspect of my safety evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| The second aspect was to consider, to the extent that was possible, the projected impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3426)|
| 0:57:15| of the proposed rezoning and subsequent redevelopment of this particular parcel of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3435)|
| 0:57:23| So I did want to give you kind of an overview of the focus of my independent safety evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3443)|
| 0:57:31| Based upon a review of several different items, and I will mention those quickly, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3451)|
| 0:57:37| did consider quite a bit of crash data provided by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3457)|
| 0:57:43| I also looked at the safety of various roadway design elements through the impacted section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3463)|
| 0:57:51| I considered traffic speeds and got speed data actually that had been gathered by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3471)|
| 0:57:58| city of Knoxville and then I also took measurements and considered site distances relative to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3478)|
| 0:58:05| access into and out of this parcel of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| So with that said, let me just go through a quick summary of my findings and conclusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3489)|
| 0:58:16| First of all, this particular section of Kingston Pike does cut through a rather large and very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3496)|
| 0:58:25| long established residential area that does include the Sequoia Hills neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| And for that reason, in my opinion, it is somewhat unique to the remainder of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3511)|
| 0:58:40| This section of Kingston Pike, and I'm talking about that nine-tenths of a mile section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| which I consider to be the major impact area, it is classified as a major arterial roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3526)|
| 0:58:53| with traffic volumes exceeding 20,000 vehicles per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| Prevailing speeds in this area are very high, even with reduced speed limits, regulatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| speed limits and also a 35 mile per hour advisory speed limit in the immediate area of the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3544)|
| 0:59:12| In fact, in the eastbound direction, the 85th percentile speed, which is a good measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3552)|
| 0:59:18| of prevailing speed, ranges between 52 and 53 miles per hour throughout the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3558)|
| 0:59:29| In the westbound direction, the speed is also very high, ranging between 48 and 49 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3569)|
| 0:59:36| per hour, this being the 85th percentile speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| I will say that approximately or up to 48 percent of the eastbound traffic is exceeding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3580)|
| 0:59:47| the posted speed limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| In the other direction, approximately 40 percent is exceeding the speed limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3591)|
| 0:59:57| In terms of the design features, this is a fairly narrow section of roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3597)|
| 1:00:04| The lanes are only about nine and a half feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| A normal travel lane is 12 feet wide, so nine would be considered potentially unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3606)|
| 1:00:13| You also have large fixed object hazards along the roadside, which makes any minor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| accident a potential for a fatal accident, and also there is severe horizontal and vertical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3618)|
| 1:00:25| alignment in this area that does impact sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| I was able to look at crash numbers and determine that on average there are 24 total crashes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3630)|
| 1:00:36| and five injury crashes in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| If you use accepted techniques in the highway safety manual, the preeminent treatise in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3639)|
| 1:00:45| this area, the normal section with these other conditions would only have eight total crashes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| compared to 24 and two injury crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| So basically, in my opinion, this is an unsafe area for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3661)|

| 1:01:49| We also represent four churches on Kingston Pike that oppose this, 10 neighborhood associations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| that oppose this, and all of the people here today who came to show their opposition to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| the zoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| If any of those people are here today, would you please stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3720)|
| 1:02:13| Although the association opposes this development, let me be very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| We are not opposed to change in the name of progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| Downtown Knoxville, for example, has ideal opportunities for development, for higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| density development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| In downtown Bearden, we spoke with some developers who are working today to create live-work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3747)|
| 1:02:33| areas in downtown Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| It's the perfect place for a development like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| Even downtown Sequoia Hills was created in the 1920s with a master plan that hoped to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3758)|
| 1:02:44| have high density, these beautiful Tudor townhomes in downtown Sequoia, and we've actually reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| out to Paul Murphy to work with us there, help build high density down there where it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| safe, where people want it, where the neighbors would welcome it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| And just a few weeks ago, another historic home just down the street from the Christenberry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| home, you may remember, it was sold to a developer who restored and saved the home, divided the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| waterfront property into three or four lots, and the Kingston Pike Sequoia Hills Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| we supported that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| And just as there are great places for development, there are places in our city for preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3796)|
| 1:03:23| The .9 mile Kingston Pike Historic District from Neyland Drive to Cherokee Boulevard is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| representative of the period before massive condo projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| In this book, Reflections of Sequoia Hills, Norman Dietrich writes, this stretch has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3814)|
| 1:03:40| been touched by high rise apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| One can still see the many stately oaks, old mansions, and all of Knoxville, this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| last section of great roads untouched, and it is the most historic of any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| By any measure, most Knoxvillians should have a very real interest in preserving and enhancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| the charm, dignity, and beauty of this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| Required to do that will be enlightened and concerned city officials who will conscientiously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| consider the special role of Sequoia Hills and the overall perception of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| It is hoped they will strive to protect its beauty as they deliberate zoning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3852)|
| 1:04:19| Paul Murphy says he plans to save the home, and we applaud you for that, Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| But is the home really saved if it's sandwiched between a parking lot and a multi-story condominium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3863)|
| 1:04:28| breathing down its neck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| The river views and vast landscape upon which that beautiful home sits are equally as historically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3870)|
| 1:04:36| valuable because the property allows the home to still present a picture of a previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| era.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| Did you know that there were once three beautiful single family homes sitting on that five acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| Today a real estate agent and neighbor, Rich Tierney, who will come up in a minute, presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| a backup offer to the Christenberries in the amount of $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| If Rich is given the opportunity to buy this property, he will preserve the home and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| land as three single family waterfront homes sitting on large parcels of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| The Christenberry home will be restored to its former glory and protected with a historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| Where did Rich get this million dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| It was procured from neighbors who were determined to save the home, save lives, save the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| save the land, and save the feel of our historic community to ensure that other homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| don't attempt to subsidize a dilapidated property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| This money came from the people you see here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| The neighbors who signed our petitions came to this meeting who emptied their pockets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| of tens of thousands of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| We believe in their heart of hearts that we must preserve this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| We must preserve our views from the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| We must preserve the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| We must preserve the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| We must preserve the lives of Knoxville citizens who are relying on you to keep our streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3945)|

| 1:05:57| If nothing else, the community has shown that the homeowners, have shown the homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| how treasured this home really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| Changing the zoning to RP1 is not the only way to save the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| Paul Murphy himself said at one point that he would still buy the property at R1 if RP1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| wasn't granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| But if Paul decides he doesn't want it, Rich Tierney and scores of neighbors, even some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| of the Christenberry family have come together and are ready and willing to purchase this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| property to restore the house, protect the land, the river views, and donate all profits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| to Knox Heritage in the Christenberry name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| Your time is up, ma'am, and I can't get my timer to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| Time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| Can I pull an Art Seymour and have 10 more seconds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=3997)|
| 1:06:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| No, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| You've got four full speakers and I can't get my timer to stop here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| Sorry, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4011)|
| 1:06:52| Thank you very much, Miss Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| Let me reboot this whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4022)|
| 1:07:03| Rich Tierney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| Thank you for being here, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| Please state your name and address for the record and I'll see if my timer works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| Rich Tierney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| I'm at 912 Ascagna Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| And I'm not sure I want to follow that, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| I'm here representing both the Kingston Pike Sequoia Hills Association as a member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| Sequoia Hills Preservation Society as the vice president,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| as well as the Kingston Pike Zoning Preservation LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4050)|
| 1:07:33| which is an LLC that I created to help these neighbors get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| and offer an alternative to the solution that is in front of you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| Mr. Seymour had mentioned, and I'll quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| if you leave the zoning R1, there is no assurance that the house will be saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4066)|
| 1:07:51| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| The only thing I can take from that is if the zoning isn't accepted today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4073)|
| 1:08:00| then we don't know what's going to happen to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| And the question I would ask is, well, if Mr. Murphy is going to buy it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| is he saying that he would tear down the house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| Or if he's not going to buy it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| is the Christenbury Estate saying that they would not be willing to sell it to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| and to the Kingston Pike Zoning Preservation LLC in order to save the house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4098)|
| 1:08:24| As Sally mentioned, we made an offer today, and I apologize that it was today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| but the reality is it's very difficult to get a private placement together on such short notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4108)|
| 1:08:34| There are certain things that have to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| We have to make sure that we're not making a public offering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| because there are certain rules and regulations associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| So things had to go in a certain order, and then once those documents were in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4123)|
| 1:08:48| then it had to be a specific method of getting investors to be involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4128)|
| 1:08:54| So because of that, it took time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| It took a lot of time, and I needed as much time as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| to make sure that we had the funds available to make this offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| We have the funds available today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| We made the offer today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| That offer was rejected outright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| It was not countered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| So at this point in time, we don't have a backup offer on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4151)|
| 1:09:17| but it's not because we don't want one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| and it's not because we aren't willing should the council today vote no to zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4159)|
| 1:09:27| to purchase this property should it not be purchased by Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| We are still willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| To the lovely lady over here, I don't recall your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| Helen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| Helen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| Helen had mentioned that she doesn't go out at rush hour on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| She does make trips downtown, but she doesn't go out at rush hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| There's a reason for that because it is awfully scary at rush hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| It's kind of white knuckle when you're going up and down Kingston Pike at rush hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| But there's a lot of people that don't have that choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| and so they are out there at rush hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| And those are the people who would leave at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| people leaving in the morning to go to work, people coming back in the evening from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| That's going to happen around the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| So these trips in and out of this particular location aren't necessarily going to be spread out all over the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4211)|
| 1:10:17| They're going to happen in the morning majority and in the afternoon, 5 o'clock, 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4217)|
| 1:10:23| And at that point in time, if you've ever driven it, I can tell you right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| if somebody's stopped in front of you to make a turn, sometimes it's awfully difficult to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4227)|
| 1:10:34| So I guess I would leave you with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| The Kingston Pike Zoning Preservation LLC is still interested in perching this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4236)|
| 1:10:42| should the zoning not be approved and should Mr. Murphy decide to exercise his contingency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| to void the contract that he currently has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| But I also want to say if this property is demolished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| then the only person who that can be laid at the feet of is the person who owns the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4255)|
| 1:11:01| That's not the council. That's not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| That's not the Kingston Pike Sequoia Hills Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| This property does not have to be demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4270)|
| 1:11:19| That concludes all the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| So, Councilman Gray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| Yes, can we ask some questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| Yes, sir. Now you may ask your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| I wanted to go back to Mr. Ferris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| On the drawings that you presented today, I wanted to ask you about what I'll refer to as the subdivision drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4295)|
| 1:11:44| Has there been any calculation in terms of the number of retaining walls and the distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| or the amount of asphalt that's going to cover the site in this particular situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| I have not done so, but you can tell just visually the extent of potential asphalt and driveways that can be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4313)|
| 1:12:02| Is the sight lines with where they're talking about putting the entrance to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| has that been checked to find out whether that's realistic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| I believe that Mr. Murphy had a traffic impact engineer look at this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| and basically that section of Kingston Pike, as you saw before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| is a fairly straight section of Kingston Pike before you get to the curbs on the far west and far east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4343)|
| 1:12:29| So from a visibility standpoint, I think it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| And then if I might, I'd like to ask, I guess it's Mr. Stevens who did the traffic study report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4354)|
| 1:12:45| I noticed that-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| Steven Richards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| I'm sorry, Steven Richards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| Excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| Needless to say, in the last six to eight weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| we've been inundated with a number of different traffic reports from both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| which is kind of interesting in terms of how you want to look at a traffic report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4381)|
| 1:13:06| Part of the questions I had was you said that you studied from Cherokee Boulevard east to Concord and Naland Drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4386)|
| 1:13:14| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| Is where all your figures are coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| Did you go the other direction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| Did you go west from Cherokee Boulevard to Lions View?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| I did not as part of my evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| When you talk about left-hand turns going in and out of properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| and I might let my fellow colleagues know that I lived on Kingston Pike for ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4410)|
| 1:13:35| and lived down near Scenic on a curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| and learned very early on that it's very important that you know how the traffic signals go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| and you go with traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| In other words, you make a choice if you want to live on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| and you make a choice in terms of how you go in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| I think you made a statement that in a 12-month period there were, what, 27 accidents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4431)|
| 1:13:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| That data came from the last four and a half years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| and on average for that four and a half year period there were 24 injury crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4446)|
| 1:14:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| The average over that time period was 28 total crashes and five injury crashes per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4459)|
| 1:14:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| It's also my understanding that there's approximately 23,000, 24,000 trips a day on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4468)|
| 1:14:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| And that, let's just say that in the one calculations that was in the book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| there were 27 accidents in a 12-month period, which would be about 2.5 per month, let's say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4481)|
| 1:14:50| So that's one every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| So that's one in 322,000 daily trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| Is that excessive or is that normal or what's the situation as far as?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| The situation on this stretch of Kingston Pike is extremely high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| As I mentioned, I used the Highway Safety Manual to compare this section to other similar sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4505)|
| 1:15:13| that have the same traffic volume levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| And if you compare this to an average section of this type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| there should only be eight total crashes and two injury crashes in this less than one mile section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| And obviously we have many, many more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| In a year's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| How does this, how does Kingston Pike, and I've had several meetings with both groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| and I understand the safety issue and I understand what we're dealing with there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| but how does Kingston Pike deal or how does it compare to Broadway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| How does it compare to Magnolia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| In other words, what is Kingston Pike, do we really have a problem on Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4550)|
| 1:15:55| or is it a perceived problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| In other words, what is your study in terms of the other areas or the other main arteries coming into the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4556)|
| 1:16:02| Okay, there are certainly other arteries that have safety problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4562)|
| 1:16:07| I think one of the primary safety problems that's unique to this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| is the fact that when you do have these crashes, they tend to be more serious crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4571)|
| 1:16:17| Some of the data indicates that the number of fatal accidents is extremely high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4577)|
| 1:16:26| I think I've got a summary of that information that will, I think, call special light to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4586)|
| 1:16:36| Yeah, looking at over the past several years, there's been an average of .7 fatal crashes per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4596)|
| 1:16:45| And for less than a one-mile section to have almost one fatality per year over a lengthy period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4605)|
| 1:16:51| means you're having some very serious crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| So when you do have a wreck on this high-speed area, it's bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| And since 1987, there's been 17 traffic deaths through this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| So, yes, I think you have a high number of crashes and they're very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| Okay, but when you say through this area, how many fatal accidents have occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4626)|
| 1:17:10| from Cherokee Boulevard east to Concord and Neyland Drive, let's say in the last 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| I don't have it for the last 10 years, but since 1987, that number is 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| Have those 17 occurred between Cherokee Boulevard and Concord?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| That's what I understand from talking with the City Traffic Engineering Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| Let me ask a question to the Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| Chief, what's your experience in terms of the traffic fatalities on Kingston Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4652)|
| 1:17:38| At this point, all I've seen is the data for the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| I can't tell you what 1987 and past then are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| From 1987 to 2004, I don't know what the numbers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| I haven't seen those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| But from April 2004 to April 2014, we've had zero fatalities in this stretch of roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4672)|
| 1:17:59| Okay. How does Kingston Pike compare to the other arteries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| Looking at the other arteries, it's hard to really say specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4684)|
| 1:18:11| because I haven't gone through and cut up the roadway and tried to find specifically matching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4691)|
| 1:18:18| But in terms of traffic flow and crashes, it appears to be about the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4698)|
| 1:18:24| as our other arteries, our main arteries that we have in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| Okay, on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| And I don't mean to speak lightly of the traffic situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| I was in an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| I was in an accident in that curb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| But it wasn't because of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| It was because two people were speed racing in the middle of the afternoon down Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4719)|
| 1:18:45| When I lived between Oakhurst and Scenic for almost 12 years, there were several accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4725)|
| 1:18:52| That was back in the 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| And there were several fatalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| And it wasn't because of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| It was because of drunk drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| It was because of young people going out and partying and then getting on a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4738)|
| 1:19:02| It's not necessarily the safest road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| Now, my concern is that, yes, there is a perception that Kingston Pike is not a safe road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4745)|
| 1:19:12| I would hope that one of the things that we do as a council and as a city and as a state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| is that we really look at this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| If, in fact, it is as dangerous as what we perceive it to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| that we work real hard to get that straightened out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| Because regardless of whether Mr. Murphy's project goes through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| if what you're telling me is that we have all these traffic problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| and we've had these deaths and we've had all these crashes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| it seems to me that we're being derelict and not fixing a situation that all of us are concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4775)|
| 1:19:41| So that's where I'm coming from, especially in the last several weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4781)|
| 1:19:45| when we've been talking about the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| To me, this issue of safety is extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| And it's one that we have to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| But I find it a bit confusing when we find these different studies that have been given to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4795)|
| 1:20:01| that the studies are only looking at from Cherokee Boulevard to Concord and Naland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4801)|
| 1:20:08| and people are saying that all these different types of things are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| I know we've received different kinds of reports from the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| in terms of what kind of crashes we have and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| And I think it's something that, you know, Mayor, it's something that we need to look into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4817)|
| 1:20:21| as far as safety not only on this street but all our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| So I think that's one thing that we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| But what I want to say is that what we have before us is a zoning and land use issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| that we have to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| And so before I go on any further, I think Mayor, some other people would like to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4836)|
| 1:20:41| All right, Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| I don't know whether I should call the traffic engineer or someone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| but as I went out and looked at the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| and, of course, people on both sides are very sincere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| and try to present their information as fairly as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| But I went out and looked at that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| and I think I saw something in Mr. Richard's report, if he's still around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| It strikes me that when you leave Cherokee, there's kind of a hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| and then you go down towards this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| which means that the line of sight looking west is somewhat limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| It's less than a tenth of a mile by my crude layman calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4873)|
| 1:21:18| And then looking east, if you're going to go that direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4878)|
| 1:21:22| or worry about cars approaching from the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| you've got that curve that you can't see around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| And so the danger becomes trying to make a left turn on a road with narrow lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4888)|
| 1:21:35| no center lane in the middle that you can turn into safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| You've got to get past the two guys coming down the hill in those two lanes from the west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| and then you've got to find a clear, fast lane on the right side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| And I am concerned about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| and I appreciate what Duane said about looking into the safety on that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| but my concern is there's no land mass relatively easily available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4913)|
| 1:21:59| There are stately homes. There are serpentine walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| There are all kinds of things on that roadway that prevent it from being just widened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| I'm not sure what the impact of the narrow lanes is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| but it strikes me that the sight distance issue is serious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| and I don't know whether the city would impose a no-left-turn requirement or what on that driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4935)|
| 1:22:22| but I could see a lot of cars coming out dodging traffic if they're going west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| and I think that is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| And, you know, one extra death, maybe that fits easily in the averages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| It's still not acceptable, and it's a scary thing to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4952)|
| 1:22:37| I don't know if there are specifics that Mr. Richard has to talk about that or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| but I think the idea is that you're going to put traffic out in an area where it is difficult to make a left-hand turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4961)|
| 1:22:50| and where safety will be involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| and that ought to be something we think about as we zone property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| and as we increase density on a property like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| I think that's my major concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| I understand and appreciate what the neighborhood is saying with regard to the historic nature of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4982)|
| 1:23:09| When you go to another city, the first thing you're drawn to is to drive through the old city sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4989)|
| 1:23:16| to see what is attractive and what history is there and what makes it unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=4996)|
| 1:23:22| I mean, you know, you can drive through Turkey Creek all day, and it's a wonderful place to shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5002)|
| 1:23:26| but there's nothing unique you're going to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| and this is kind of the feel of the community and its history that goes back to the early days, and that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5009)|
| 1:23:36| I see the gentleman's at the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5016)|
| 1:23:37| Would you tell me what are the limits from cars coming from the west to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5017)|
| 1:23:44| and then looking east as they come around that curve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| That seems to me to be the scary element there in terms of how much reaction time do you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5027)|
| 1:23:53| and is there a safe harbor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5033)|
| 1:23:54| There's no center lane you can pull into, so describe that for us, would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5034)|
| 1:23:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| There are sight distance concerns associated with this parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| regardless of where you put the driveway coming in and out of that particular parcel of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5044)|
| 1:24:11| And you hit the nail right on the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| There are problems pulling out of the driveway, looking back to your right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| and having to make a left turn into traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| Sight distance is limited looking back up that hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| For a passenger car, considering prevailing traffic speeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| it's just literally right at the recommended minimum value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| I think within four feet of that, which doesn't leave much margin for error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5074)|
| 1:24:39| If you look at single unit trucks, which would be like a delivery truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5079)|
| 1:24:45| or maybe a garbage pickup or a mail truck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| then it's inadequate for those vehicles to actually make a left turn into and out of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5088)|
| 1:24:53| Because they're slower moving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| Well, they are slower moving, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| I was curious, when I read the MPC record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| there wasn't a single helpful word from city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| And Mr. Howley does this all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| Well, this is the zoning portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| Come back at the planned use level, and we'll talk about the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| But the city did not provide any base information at that meeting that would help the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5115)|
| 1:25:22| And now us understand what the road restrictions are, what the dangers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5122)|
| 1:25:28| And I frankly was appalled by that, since that seems to be one of the dominant things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| And I don't know why we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5133)|
| 1:25:34| But he should have been prepared to know that moving a bunch of cars in and out of Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5134)|
| 1:25:40| that's a narrow and has no safe harbor shoulder or center lane is something of real concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5140)|
| 1:25:46| Maybe, Jim, maybe you have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| But I didn't find anything in the record that helped me know where the city was coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5148)|
| 1:25:53| The city is coming from fair application of standards, as our development manuals present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5153)|
| 1:26:02| and the professional guidelines that we were given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5162)|
| 1:26:09| As Dr. Richard says, it's within the safe site distances as defined by our guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5169)|
| 1:26:24| At least so it appears at the beginning, it hasn't been that those numbers haven't been certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5184)|
| 1:26:31| We're not seeing anything at this point that would raise that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5191)|
| 1:26:38| Well, I mean, there's some yellow flags, but there's no red flags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| Clearly, it's not the safest section of road in the world, and we have to take safety very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5203)|
| 1:26:55| Everybody who gets into a car any time is accepting some risk, and we still have to get places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5215)|
| 1:27:04| So in this particular case, we have a set of professional guidelines that we have to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5224)|
| 1:27:12| We have to apply them fairly and consistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| We still have some questions that have not been answered about specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| We haven't got the final design yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| Well, we have the concept plan that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| We have some questions that have not been answered by that, and we'll continue to pursue some answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5248)|
| 1:27:33| As a state or U.S. highway, does anyone else have a say, or does the city govern all of those requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| As far as the cross-section of the road and the layout of the road goes, it is a state highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5258)|
| 1:27:45| And TDOT, it's within TDOT's bailiwick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5265)|
| 1:27:50| We do have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| Do they delegate it down to you, or do you have them do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| Well, for zoning and development, they still have a say in access, but they usually delegate decisions like this down to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5275)|
| 1:28:07| So you coordinate with them after you've done your analysis, is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| Are you concerned with the text and the guidelines that Mr. Richards used or Professor Richards used to analyze it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5290)|
| 1:28:16| Was he using the right material?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| I did not see the details of his report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| I understand it got released Friday or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| I was out of town until Friday, so I've not seen the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5308)|
| 1:28:29| The details that we've been supplied by the developers, engineers, so far as all the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| Well, I mean, we've seen some back and forth between different engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| but so far I haven't seen anything that would, from our perspective, would kill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5317)|
| 1:28:42| There may be some cautions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| There may be some improvements that could be made along the line that could help things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5333)|
| 1:28:54| I have to disclose a conflict of interest that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| and I will have to recuse myself from the discussion and the vote tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| due to a longstanding and ongoing business relationship I have with Mr. Christenberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5340)|
| 1:29:06| My firm manages other commercial properties for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| Even though I'm not involved in the sale or the transaction of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| it does give me a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| And I want to protect the integrity of the vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| and certainly make my conflict of interest known, and I will abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5356)|
| 1:29:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5361)|
| 1:29:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5362)|
| 1:29:23| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5363)|
| 1:29:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5364)|
| 1:29:25| I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| One for Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| Speak a little bit about the slope concerns, the staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5369)|
| 1:29:33| Does this design plan fall within the slope protection guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5373)|
| 1:29:38| At this point we haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| We've just received the development plan in the last 10 days or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| so that will be scheduled for the July MPC meeting depending on the zoning case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5384)|
| 1:29:52| But the Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan makes several recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5392)|
| 1:29:57| about how we should go about developing when there are slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| the first of which is to use the RP, planned residential zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| It then has suggested density factors that we applied to this particular property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5408)|
| 1:30:14| and came up with a proposed density of a little more than three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5414)|
| 1:30:22| which we rounded up to four for our staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| based on this particular location with its proximity to frontage on a major highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5426)|
| 1:30:36| adjacent to two large church sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| And with the R1 zoning where you can get four units to the acre by right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5441)|
| 1:30:48| we made our recommendation of four units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5448)|
| 1:30:53| The planning commission, after the discussion at the public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5453)|
| 1:30:58| that there was a proposal to save the house utilizing funds from the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5458)|
| 1:31:04| made the recommendation at 5.6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| which is still in conformity with the low density residential density for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5467)|
| 1:31:14| But the number of dwelling units might actually exceed the slope plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5474)|
| 1:31:19| Now they're proposing 21, which is still greater than the density factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5479)|
| 1:31:28| from the Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| But keep in mind that that is a planned document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| It hasn't been codified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| It is recommendations, and there are mitigating circumstances for every piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5496)|
| 1:31:41| Yeah, that was unfortunate it wasn't codified, just recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| The second question, I think, for Mr. Eyde, I was going to ask about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5505)|
| 1:31:50| when I met Mr. Murphy on site, I asked about stormwater detention and management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| and I think he mentioned something about subsurface cells maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| or how is that going to be handled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| I don't see anything on the plan that shows it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| Most probably it would be in the form of self-filtration top catch basins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5523)|
| 1:32:08| or underground structures that would filter the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5528)|
| 1:32:12| or there could be a potential for an above-ground stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5532)|
| 1:32:17| basically a natural type of filtration system before the water does get to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5537)|
| 1:32:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| So that would definitely be addressed in the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| It seems like developments of this scope with as much impervious surface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| would have something most developments have, some kind of detention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| And as for the paving area, the garage, the roof structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| just like any other development, it would be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| Well, Leslie, I too never imagined there would be a conflict with my job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5557)|
| 1:32:43| but alas, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| For the past two to three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| the organization I work for has received thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| from the Sequoia Hills Homeowners Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| We manage, we provide services in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| and that's solicited every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| so I feel like there's a very real conflict of interest there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| and I won't be voting on it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5585)|
| 1:33:06| Councilman Gray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| Do any of my other colleagues have anything to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| We all abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| When we have a motion, I'll have something to say, but not right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| All right, well, let me go ahead and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5598)|
| 1:33:21| Mayor, with all due respect, I put my words down on paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| because of what I've been through for the last six to eight weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| in trying to work with both groups, which have both been very cooperative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5609)|
| 1:33:34| So you all have copies of what I'm about to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| so just, if you will, follow along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| I want to say, first of all, that both groups have worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| They've been very open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| They've been communicative to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| But this has been a very difficult issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| as the passion on both sides are very high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| as you can tell by the number of people that are here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| Both sides have addressed their concerns to me privately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| and in meetings that I've held with both parties present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| Several meetings have been held at my office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| with the individuals separately and with the two sides together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| as they discuss their views on the proposed project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| I've read the reports from both parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| and have made suggestions for changes to the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| consistent with concerns expressed by each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| Let me stress and make the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| that this is a land use and zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| That doesn't mean that I'm not concerned about safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| but one of the things that's before this council tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| is a land use and zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| I've talked to MPC with regard to surrounding land uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| residential densities, the zoning of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| the historical aspect of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| I've worked with city engineering in regard to stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| And by the way, Mark, they have one of the best places to run water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| which is right down into the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| Slope development and with city traffic engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| and the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| I met just recently yesterday with Jim Hagerman on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| to discuss what requirements would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| And I might also say right now that it does seem to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| that it's a little backwards that we're required to approve zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| before a development plan is looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| but that's the way it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| In the meeting that I've had held to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| I've held a meeting to see if there's any common ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| and three major issues have been emphasized each time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| These are not necessarily in order or in priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| but the preservation of the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| rezoning a property from R1 to RP1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| and the effect that it may have on future development of Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5733)|
| 1:35:37| and then the traffic and safety concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| Let's talk a minute about the preservation of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| The section of Kingston Pike that runs between Nalin Drive and Lions View| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| is a major historic gateway through the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| and has significant history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| There are a few early 1900 homes still left on the pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| that add to the unique visual and historical character of the pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5756)|
| 1:36:00| and the Christenberry House is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| In this proposal, the developer has committed to restore the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| and has agreed to an H1 historic overlay as a means to that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5767)|
| 1:36:12| Mr. Murphy and his family live three lots east of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| in a historic house that he restored and renovated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| and it has an H1 overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| He does have a track record on historic renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| The rezoning of the property and how this might affect future development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| Let's address the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| It's a site bound by the river on the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5793)|
| 1:36:36| churches on the east and west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| and Kingston Pike to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| An objective review of the facts show that the section of Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| this section of Kingston Pike, between Nalin Drive and Cherokee Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| and continuing to Lions View,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| include a mix of land uses and residential types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| If you travel east from Cherokee Boulevard to Concord and Nalin Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| there are 43 parcels of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| of which I've given you some zoning maps to show you folks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| Of the 43 parcels of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| five parcels are condo or apartment units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| which I think have over 60 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| Two parcels are historic houses and event facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| You have Crescent Bend and Bleak House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| Twenty parcels are single-family houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| Three parcels are empty lots not big enough for an RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| Nine parcels are owned by churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| Two parcels are offices all the way at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| One parcel is a historic home office and event facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| which was recently done, and that's Westwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| And one parcel is the Teen Board Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| There are no single-family residences adjacent to the proposed site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| and one lot over is an existing RP1 residential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5867)|
| 1:37:52| which is LaRue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| To the west from Cherokee Boulevard to Lyons View,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| there are 71 parcels of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| of which 52 are single-family residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| Of those properties, there are possibly and maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| two that have enough available land to be developed as an RP1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| but those properties are all surrounded by an R1 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| single-family residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| The zoning change would be unlikely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| because of the adjacent single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| This greatly affects how MPC looks at a recommendation for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| Any change would be on a case-by-case basis and examined very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5907)|
| 1:38:32| And I've had a discussion with Mark about this in terms of zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| and some of us who have been dealing with zoning know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| that that's one of the things that we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| is the adjacent properties and the relationship of those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| to the proposed zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| The properties adjacent to the Christenbury site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| are churches, not single-family residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| So having this property rezoned to RP1, in my view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| is not precedent-setting for the other possible sites on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5937)|
| 1:39:02| Finally, the proposed zoning, land use, and low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| are consistent with the adopted one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| that we recently adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| I do want to just briefly discuss about traffic and safety concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5952)|
| 1:39:16| Obviously, traffic and safety are issues of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| However, according to the city police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| Kingston Pike has experienced a decline in trips per day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| traffic volume, and accident history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| There's not been a traffic fatality on Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| between Cherokee Boulevard and Naland Drive for the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| You heard the chief address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| We have a plan before us that preserves the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| Mr. Murphy has agreed to renovate the exterior of the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| once he has a building permit in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| This means that the house will be renovated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| as the construction of the project is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5990)|
| 1:39:53| The house will be a single-family residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| and will not be used as a sales office or a construction office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=5995)|
| 1:40:00| As to the condominium project itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| he's agreed to build 20 units with underground parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| rather than the earlier proposed 26 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6006)|
| 1:40:11| The footprint of the structure will allow more green space and landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6011)|
| 1:40:16| The approach allows for a more sustainable project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6016)|
| 1:40:20| With the deletion of the lower six units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| this also will help preserve the hillside to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6022)|
| 1:40:27| The proposed development meets the intent of the city's zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6027)|
| 1:40:32| to encourage the most appropriate use of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| to maintain and stabilize the value of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| and to create a comprehensive and stable pattern of land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6038)|
| 1:40:44| The proposed zoned district will not adversely affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| any other part of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| or have any direct or indirect adverse effects resulting from the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6049)|
| 1:40:55| The section of Kingston Pike from Concord Street to Cherokee Boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| is a mix of land uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| with large churches, apartments, condominiums, museums, event facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| and houses on large and small lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| Any impact to the proposed development will be consistent with these nearby uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6068)|
| 1:41:14| The proposed zoned district is consistent with the type of low-density zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6074)|
| 1:41:20| recommended by the hillside and ridgetop protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| and the recommended density is consistent with the future land use plan of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6084)|
| 1:41:30| The general plan encourages growth in the existing urban area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| by developing infill housing on vacant lots and redevelopment parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| The West Sector City Plan and the Knoxville One-Year Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| propose low-density residential uses of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| consistent with the proposed RP1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6107)|
| 1:41:52| I support the current city policy that encourages infill houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6112)|
| 1:41:57| and discourages urban sprawl where appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| This council has talked about this on a number of occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6121)|
| 1:42:04| We need to consider options for individuals who desire to live in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6124)|
| 1:42:08| and have the opportunity to purchase newly constructed units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| close to downtown and on the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| Our city must encourage growth within the existing urban area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| We need to encourage growth in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| We've not grown fast enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| If council does not approve the change in zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| there will be no further requirement of Mr. Murphy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| to discuss his subdivision plan with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| He would be allowed to subdivide his property into lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| There are 4.8 acres of property in which he could possibly build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| as many as 15 or 20 houses with the demolition of the historic house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6161)|
| 1:42:46| If instead, if we approve the RP1 zoning change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| there will be a development plan required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| and the neighborhood will have the opportunity for input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| on the development plan at the public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| And I think that both parties in the last 6 to 8 weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| have both kept an open line of communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| I wasn't able to get a total agreement from both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| but I think that if we did have the development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| that Mr. Murphy is open to listening to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| The proposed development would only add 5 more residential units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6195)|
| 1:43:20| on the 4.8 acres and include preservation of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6200)|
| 1:43:25| So we're talking the difference of 5 additional houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| on property that could be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| Now let me say that it would be politically easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| to vote no on this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6215)|
| 1:43:38| but I was elected to make decisions based on the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| and the merits of each issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| I do have a responsibility to my constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| and that responsibility requires that I examine each side of the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6226)|
| 1:43:51| to do my due diligence, to apply my experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6231)|
| 1:43:55| and to carefully consider and give credence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| to the MPC recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| With that in mind, I am supporting the change in zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| from R1 to RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| Finding that the existing house on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| is a significant historic dwelling worthy of preservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| I recommend that an application for the establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| of an H1 zone district be properly made for consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6257)|
| 1:44:21| by the City of Knoxville Historic Zoning Commission and the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6261)|
| 1:44:26| I also propose that a condition to change the zoning to RP1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6266)|
| 1:44:31| is that no clearing, grading, or demolition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6271)|
| 1:44:35| of the existing house occur on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| until such time as a use on review or development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| is approved by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| as stated in their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6284)|
| 1:44:47| I therefore move that Council accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| the Metropolitan Planning Commission's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| to rezone the property to a classification of RP1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| planned residential, but with one change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| and that is at a density of up to 4.9 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6299)|
| 1:45:05| subject to the above consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| if I can make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6307)|
| 1:45:11| Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6311)|
| 1:45:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6314)|
| 1:45:15| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| This is certainly a tough issue, maybe the toughest issue I've faced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6320)|
| 1:45:25| and I think it starts with the fact that we've got, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| I think we have a really good developer, and he's also a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6328)|
| 1:45:33| He lives two doors down and has done a fantastic job on his property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6333)|
| 1:45:39| and really is an asset to Kingston Pike and the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6339)|
| 1:45:44| I think the proposal is not all bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| You know, I think a lot of things have been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| including what Mr. Greaves said, there's a lot of merit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| saving the structure of the home and some of those issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6354)|
| 1:45:59| but unfortunately I'm not able to support this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6359)|
| 1:46:03| I just see that stretch of Kingston Pike as a unique, special stretch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6363)|
| 1:46:09| and I don't think this type of proposal is the right fit for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6369)|
| 1:46:14| I'm certainly not in favor of the alternative that's been drawn here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6374)|
| 1:46:19| but I hope that's not the result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| I just think it's a special stretch, and I can't, it just didn't feel right to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6383)|
| 1:46:29| and I don't want to encourage that in other places on this stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6389)|
| 1:46:33| So that's my position, but it was a very difficult issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6393)|
| 1:46:38| Councilman Greaves, I just want to clarify that, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6398)|
| 1:46:51| if you want to make a motion to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| you first have to make a motion to approve as is and get a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6413)|
| 1:46:56| and then you make a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| Okay, I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| I'll make a motion to approve as read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6422)|
| 1:47:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6424)|
| 1:47:05| Then I'd like to make an amendment that we change from what is shown as 5.6 dwellings per unit per acre to 4.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6425)|
| 1:47:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6434)|
| 1:47:15| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6436)|
| 1:47:17| Now, Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| This has certainly been a difficult and emotional issue for, I think, everybody involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| whether you're on council, whether you're a developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| whether you live on the Kingston Pike, Sequoia Hills area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6449)|
| 1:47:35| Two weeks ago, this council approved a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| that had a significant amount of money for historic preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6458)|
| 1:47:42| There was a great deal of angst as we discussed the prior brown garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6462)|
| 1:47:47| and the potential for that to be demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6467)|
| 1:47:50| The Christenberry House, under the proposal we have before us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| will be preserved at no cost to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| Two weeks ago, this council approved a property tax increase to meet some burgeoning expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6477)|
| 1:48:04| We are all very well aware that the city needs revenue resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6484)|
| 1:48:09| This property currently generates approximately $7,000 annually in property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6489)|
| 1:48:15| The infill housing will generate close to $100,000 in revenue from property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6495)|
| 1:48:22| Infill housing has been an ongoing conversation for several councils, not just this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6502)|
| 1:48:28| as the amount of developable land within the city is scarce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6508)|
| 1:48:33| This Kingston Pike property offers an opportunity for infill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6513)|
| 1:48:38| that will generate much higher revenues than we typically see in the form of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6518)|
| 1:48:45| Initially, the Kingston Pike Sequoia Hills Association stated their concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6525)|
| 1:48:50| was the demolition of the Christenberry House located between the two churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| and excluded from previous historical overlay activities because of location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6534)|
| 1:49:00| When the petitions were circulated at Sequoia Elementary School on Election Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6540)|
| 1:49:06| it was my understanding that many of the people thought they were signing a petition to save the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6546)|
| 1:49:12| If that is my misunderstanding, that's my misunderstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| When the preservation of the Christenberry House came off the table as an issue for the association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6557)|
| 1:49:24| traffic on Kingston Pike seemed to become the new cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6564)|
| 1:49:28| Council has received either three or four traffic studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| Two of them look alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| Three of them are closely resembling, and one doesn't resemble any of the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6574)|
| 1:49:39| One of these was commissioned by opponents of the property development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6579)|
| 1:49:43| and some were proposed by others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6583)|
| 1:49:47| The fact is that traffic on Kingston Pike has declined since the Smart Fix 40 was completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6587)|
| 1:49:53| An analysis of city data shows that the hours of 6 to 10 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6593)|
| 1:49:58| are typically when people are going to work with the spread continuing to noon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| so that's when traffic is the highest volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| Additionally, new shopping outlets at the University Commons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| are expected to reduce traffic going west to Bearden to do their shopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6609)|
| 1:50:14| Interestingly, Knox Heritage events will bring 200-plus people to this area when they have events and activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6614)|
| 1:50:22| I've not heard a peep from anyone concerned about that increase in traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6622)|
| 1:50:27| I decided to look up some data about Sequoia Hills from the city data website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6627)|
| 1:50:34| and I learned that the whole area is 1.6 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| We're apparently concerned about one mile of that, of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6637)|
| 1:50:42| Population is 2,849, and there are 1,720 people per square mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6642)|
| 1:50:49| The median income of the area labeled Sequoia Hills is $51,889.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6649)|
| 1:50:56| Interestingly, there are 1,367 males who have a median age of 38 who live in Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6656)|
| 1:51:05| There are 1,478 females with a median age of 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6665)|
| 1:51:11| That really did surprise me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| There is an average of two people per household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| There are 741 apartments in Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| and they have an average of 1.4 cars compared with an average of two cars for single-family dwellings and condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6680)|
| 1:51:28| 6.6% of the residents in Sequoia Hills live below the poverty level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6688)|
| 1:51:34| Now, my people on council understand that I do this kind of thing, and they're used to it, so just deal with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6694)|
| 1:51:40| Humor me, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| This has been a very emotional issue, as most land issues that come before us are emotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6702)|
| 1:51:48| We have letters of support from prominent residents who live on Kingston Pipe near this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6708)|
| 1:51:54| Joe Nash, Sharon Miller Price, John Trotter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6714)|
| 1:51:59| We also have letters from the Fieldens and some others who don't actually live on Kingston Pipe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6719)|
| 1:52:04| but they run up and down the street daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| MPC staff recommended approval of this application, and then the commission itself voted 11-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6728)|
| 1:52:16| The developer of this project is a neighbor in Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| He lives three doors from the property in a house he's renovated at great expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6739)|
| 1:52:24| To be real honest, it kind of bothered me that there's such strong feeling against a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6744)|
| 1:52:30| That kind of bothered me a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6750)|
| 1:52:33| Sequoia Hills residents have had nine years to watch this property decline in a move to become blighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6753)|
| 1:52:38| but no group has stepped up to consider purchasing the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| until one of the neighbors who lives in the neighborhood expressed interest and suggested tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6762)|
| 1:52:47| that he's put together a million dollars to try to see if the Christenberries will sell to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6767)|
| 1:52:55| Change is a real tough pill to swallow, but folks, change is coming sooner or later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6775)|
| 1:53:01| Mr. Mercury's rezoning is an opportunity to preserve a historic house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6781)|
| 1:53:06| and bring very few new neighbors to Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| most of whom will no doubt support many of the activities of the association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6790)|
| 1:53:15| Fear of change fuels emotions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6795)|
| 1:53:18| Some individuals' agenda fuel those fears into frenzy with half-truths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6798)|
| 1:53:24| or data manipulated to fit their personal agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| I've seen this in other cities on other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| If this council does not approve this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6810)|
| 1:53:40| I fear the Christenberry House will become a pile of rubble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| and the land will be redeveloped sooner or later into something the neighborhood really does not want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6824)|
| 1:53:50| I'll be supporting the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| and urge my fellow council members to think about actions we've taken in the past few weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6832)|
| 1:53:57| and also support the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| It fits our support for preservation, infill, and the needed increased revenue in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6839)|
| 1:54:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| Thank you, Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6847)|
| 1:54:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6850)|
| 1:54:11| First, I want to thank Dwayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| Dwayne has worked very hard on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| I know he has met with both the neighborhood representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| and the developer and his representatives and has tried mightily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6858)|
| 1:54:22| I have met with many of you, and I'm looking in the audience now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6862)|
| 1:54:25| and see many people I know and have grown up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| and some who have acted as father or mother to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6868)|
| 1:54:32| But I'm a son of Sequoia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| I grew up on Tlahee Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| and I've watched for almost 70 years the Kingston Pike evolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6877)|
| 1:54:45| First, with my parents, I would ride up and down Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| going to various places like the S&W downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6888)|
| 1:54:51| and then I would take public transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| and go down to what I'm sure many of you will remember as the Booth Theater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6893)|
| 1:54:57| down in what is now the Strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6897)|
| 1:55:00| I also remember the iterations of change on Kingston Pike with the traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6900)|
| 1:55:07| the three lanes going into town in the morning and one going out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6907)|
| 1:55:11| and reversing that in the afternoon in an attempt to manage the traffic better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6911)|
| 1:55:15| swapping the lanes around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| I remember a traffic signal that was put up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| a traffic control signal that was put up close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6921)|
| 1:55:24| I think just east of this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6924)|
| 1:55:28| I knew Kingston Pike, as I think many of you did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| and I can see some of the audience that I know remember this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6930)|
| 1:55:33| before churches came to Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6933)|
| 1:55:36| And now there are 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6936)|
| 1:55:40| There were always apartments on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| Now there are six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| I think there were four originally, and now there are six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6944)|
| 1:55:47| and that includes condominium development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6947)|
| 1:55:50| I've watched as beautiful old homes along the Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6950)|
| 1:55:55| were either not cared for or were sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| and many of them are now church sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6958)|
| 1:56:01| One is now a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6961)|
| 1:56:05| Some have become a cluster of homes that now total five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| Originally, in my lifetime at least, there was only one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| and that was in the 1950s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6972)|
| 1:56:15| So Kingston Pike has always changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| and it will continue to evolve as every other area in our city does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6978)|
| 1:56:25| This is what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| We grow and we change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6987)|
| 1:56:29| It is the only constant in any of our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| R1, RP1, in my mind, are artificial designations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6993)|
| 1:56:39| but they do help control and manage growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=6999)|
| 1:56:44| As has been said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| there are very good people on both sides of this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7006)|
| 1:56:50| who care very much for the beautiful area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| and none of whom want to see harm be visited upon this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7014)|
| 1:56:59| So I see this as part of the evolutionary nature of Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7019)|
| 1:57:04| and I've already had, by the way, one individual who indicated to me today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7024)|
| 1:57:08| that he and his wife would be interested in living in this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7028)|
| 1:57:13| So I find this to be a reasonable proposal, and I will be supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7033)|
| 1:57:20| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7040)|
| 1:57:23| I did want to go back on just a couple of issues, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| First of all, I want to ask Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7046)|
| 1:57:31| Mr. Seymour, I've met with city engineering out on the site, Mr. Hagerman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| as I mentioned on Monday, to talk about site distances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7055)|
| 1:57:40| We also had a discussion about the possibility, it's a long shot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7060)|
| 1:57:45| but a possibility of a turn lane being made available, especially for left-hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7065)|
| 1:57:50| much like the turn lane into Cherokee Boulevard that was done a number of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7070)|
| 1:57:55| But it was also my understanding that as far as safety issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| that Mr. Murphy has stated that he'll do what he can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7078)|
| 1:58:02| in terms of putting up a caution light or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7082)|
| 1:58:05| that he'll go beyond whatever's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| Is this the case in terms of dealing with the safety aspect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7087)|
| 1:58:11| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| Once he gets his development plan finally submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7093)|
| 1:58:17| of course it will be vetted by city engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7097)|
| 1:58:20| and he will do whatever they require and accept that only as a minimum requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7100)|
| 1:58:26| He would intend to work to make it a very attractive entrance and a very safe entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7106)|
| 1:58:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7112)|
| 1:58:33| And then to Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7113)|
| 1:58:35| Mark, if this goes through, just briefly explain the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7115)|
| 1:58:41| and the process that the neighborhood would have as far as input, not only to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7121)|
| 1:58:47| but I know that Mr. Murphy and the Sequoia Hills Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7127)|
| 1:58:53| who we have spent quite a bit of time together, will continue to communicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7133)|
| 1:58:58| But explain what happens during that process, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7138)|
| 1:59:03| With the approval of a planned residential zone district would come the second step then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7143)|
| 1:59:10| in the zoning process, which is consideration of what we call a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7150)|
| 1:59:16| by the Planning Commission with some sort of a decision on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7156)|
| 1:59:21| We've received in the last week the application for the July meeting for that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7161)|
| 1:59:30| With the receipt of that application, we then circulate it amongst the various review bodies within the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7170)|
| 1:59:37| and ultimately we will make a recommendation on that development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7177)|
| 1:59:43| after meeting with the developer and applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| Usually there's back and forth several times before we get it in a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7186)|
| 1:59:53| that we're able to make a recommendation on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7193)|
| 1:59:56| I believe the Planning Commission meeting in July is on the 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7196)|
| 2:00:02| so there will be a public hearing for anybody that wants to weigh in on that specific plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7202)|
| 2:00:09| And then should anybody choose to appeal the decision of the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7209)|
| 2:00:15| that can happen and that appeal would come to the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7215)|
| 2:00:20| Has this always been the way it's been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7220)|
| 2:00:23| I mean, we do a zoning change and then do a development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7223)|
| 2:00:26| Did we ever do a development plan first where we knew what was going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7226)|
| 2:00:29| I mean, you know, you're asking, not you personally, but I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| we're asking City Council to approve something that we don't really know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7232)|
| 2:00:37| We don't really know what it is, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7237)|
| 2:00:40| It has been the history here in Knoxville to change the zoning map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7240)|
| 2:00:45| to the planned residential zone district prior to consideration of the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7245)|
| 2:00:51| Occasionally someone will submit a very draft or conceptual plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7251)|
| 2:00:57| in support of the zoning application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7257)|
| 2:01:01| making the judgment that if people can see what they're actually proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7261)|
| 2:01:05| that they would have a better outcome on their zoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7265)|
| 2:01:10| But that happens rarely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7270)|
| 2:01:12| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| Okay, so, Council Member?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| Mayor, I was just going to say that I'd like to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7277)|
| 2:01:21| What we'll do is, let me just explain first so everybody understands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7281)|
| 2:01:26| There's a motion to approve the original ordinance as recommended by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7286)|
| 2:01:31| the RP1 at 5.6 million units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7291)|
| 2:01:34| Then there was a motion to amend to 4.9 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7294)|
| 2:01:39| We'll first vote on the amendment, and then after that vote occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7299)|
| 2:01:45| then we go back to the original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7305)|
| 2:01:48| which is to approve either what MPC recommended or as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7308)|
| 2:01:53| So, and we have two abstentions due to conflicts of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7313)|
| 2:02:00| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7320)|
| 2:02:01| And two abstentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7321)|
| 2:02:04| By our rules, we still need five votes to approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7324)|
| 2:02:09| even though only seven people will be voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| You need five votes in order to approve either of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7331)|
| 2:02:14| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7334)|
| 2:02:15| If the amendment fails, it's possible for the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7335)|
| 2:02:19| You still go back to the original, which is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| Back to the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7341)|
| 2:02:22| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7342)|
| 2:02:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7343)|
| 2:02:24| So we understand that, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7344)|
| 2:02:25| Okay, so first we're going to vote on the motion to amend to 4.9 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7345)|
| 2:02:30| and we'll do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7352)|

| 2:02:45| This is the amendment, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7365)|
| 2:02:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7366)|
| 2:02:47| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7367)|

| 2:02:56| Councilman Dela Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7376)|
| 2:02:59| Yes, only on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7379)|
| 2:03:03| Okay, the amendment is approved at 4.9 dwelling units per acre, 5 to 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7383)|
| 2:03:13| Now we go to the motion to approve overall as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7393)|
| 2:03:17| So you'll be voting on approving the rezoning to RP1 at 4.9 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7397)|
| 2:03:24| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7404)|

| 2:08:08| I'd like to thank the council for their consideration that they gave our issue that we had before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7688)|
| 2:08:14| you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7694)|
| 2:08:15| I know that it was not an easy issue, and most every one of you I talked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7695)|
| 2:08:20| And Councilman Grieve, we appreciate the efforts that you made to try to come up with a compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7700)|
| 2:08:27| and we elected you to vote your heart, and we hope that you would agree with us most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7707)|
| 2:08:33| of the time, but we support you even when you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7713)|
| 2:08:36| Councilwoman Palmer, let me assure you of one thing, just so you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7716)|
| 2:08:42| There was a lot of information and misinformation that was out, undoubtedly on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7722)|
| 2:08:48| Myself and Chuck Burks got 90% of the petitions signed at election day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7728)|
| 2:08:57| If you look at the petition, it says nothing about saving the house, and I assure you that Mr. Burks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7737)|
| 2:09:02| and myself, I know, never mentioned the reason to sign the petition was to save the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7742)|
| 2:09:09| We led with safety because, in my mind, lives trump houses any day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7749)|
| 2:09:16| So just so that you'll know that, that we didn't try to mislead anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7756)|
| 2:09:21| The other 10%, I don't know, I went to lunch at one some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7761)|
| 2:09:27| But anyway, I appreciate the vote of Council, and I know that you guys have the best interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7767)|
| 2:09:37| of the city at heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7777)|
| 2:09:38| We might not all agree on everything, but reasonable people disagree from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7778)|
| 2:09:44| and I think that's what makes our city strong because you just can't always have one view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7784)|
| 2:09:52| and you can't have tunnel vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| And whatever happens with this property, I just want to assure you that we'll do our best to save the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7794)|
| 2:10:01| Hopefully Mr. Christenberry may reconsider and take our offer, or Mr. Murphy may decide to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7801)|
| 2:10:07| the property along whatever lines he does that MPC will be happy with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7807)|
| 2:10:13| I won't keep you any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7813)|
| 2:10:14| I know it's been a long night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7814)|
| 2:10:16| But thank you very much again for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7816)|
| 2:10:19| Even though we don't agree with you at all times, and you don't agree with us at all times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7819)|
| 2:10:26| we do appreciate the diligence that you give to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140610?start=7826)|
