| 0:04:58| Or, Mr. Mattis, do you want to speak unless it's up to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| Does anybody want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| If you don't care, Eddie, if you want to talk about name and address, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| Let me see if I can get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| Eddie Mattis, 3835 Kingston Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| I am the vice chair, the incoming chair of the zoo board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| And for those of you who may not know, about a year ago we had an administration change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| Lisa New became the new executive director of the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| And shortly after that, the board embarked on about an eight-month strategic planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| which brings us where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| And part of that strategic planning process, for those of you who have ever been to the zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| and I hope all of you have been to the zoo or will come to the zoo, as you enter the zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| sometimes you wonder exactly where the zoo is, if you get off Rutledge Pike or off of Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| So you wonder where the zoo is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| So if approved, these funds, now that approved, these funds will help us with a very nice portal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=352)|
| 0:05:59| We kind of say it could look a little bit like, we hope, Disney World,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| with topiaries that are actually sculpted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| And so we'll have both entry portals, and you will know exactly where the zoo is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| Any questions or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| Thank you, Eddie. Appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=374)|

| 0:08:15| Sewell is the seventh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| No, there's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| That's what I was confused on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| I was like two Sewells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| Two Sewells, Dennis Sewell and Bill Sewell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| Dennis Sewell is for the third district representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| The fifth district representative is John Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| and the seventh district representative is Bill Sewell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| So those are the fill-ins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=530)|
| 0:09:03| We're on page 10, item 42, resolution 908.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| It's urging the Tennessee General Assembly to designate Powell Drive as a scenic highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| I think the motion will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| I guess the reason I didn't put it on consent was I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| Does that do anything with the zoning there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| Well, what we're trying to do out there is the new Powell extension from the bridge all the way to Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=569)|
| 0:09:39| we would like to keep that to where we don't have buildings more than 35 feet tall and the signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=579)|
| 0:09:47| we have control over it, and then also on the way this highway will look from the bridge part all the way to Clinton Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=587)|
| 0:09:54| to where it will be more scenic and not so commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| Are there any structures that violate those setbacks now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=602)|
| 0:10:09| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| The manufacturing probably doesn't yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| Even the manufacturing out there, like the, oh, even where the church is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=612)|
| 0:10:20| The Royal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| Well, the Royal and that group out there does not exceed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| And what we want to do is bring it for discussion so if there's anybody opposed to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| they can come and have a community to speak about if they don't want it to be a scenic highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=632)|
| 0:10:41| But we'd like to get it cleared up to where we can send it to the state to where they would approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| We're just doing it as a community service where they can speak to it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| This does nothing more than send a letter to the delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| The reason I was asking is that on Johnsonville Highway South,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| the state came through and made a bunch of them move their signs back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| and everything else to be in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| The reason I was asking is if there's anything here that they might get prepared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| There's nothing on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| It's a brand-new road, so there's nothing out there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| This is, I think, some of the things Commissioner Brown has brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=681)|
| 0:11:27| Just to be certain, we know the consequences of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| Recently on Middlebrook Pike, it was a scenic highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| and it literally took an act of the General Assembly to remove the scenic highway designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=693)|
| 0:11:39| so they could rezone for the hospital they want to be out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| And then at the next session, they'll redesignate that as a scenic highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=703)|
| 0:11:49| I mean, is this something that you never want really developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| I don't know the road very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| On one side of the road out there, it's floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| I mean, there would have to be a lot of field work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| It's where Beaver Creek comes down through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| On the other side that backs up to it, there's a few individual homes out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| and that's basically it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| You know, how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| I should know the area better than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| I'm just not familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| A couple of miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| A couple of miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| It's really not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| And it may be a more wise discussion to have with MPC about neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| versus scenic highway, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| I mean, but I guess the point being, I mean, I know this is just urging the General Assembly to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| but do we need maybe to have the law director give us more indication about what that really means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=758)|
| 0:12:47| Because you may not be able to do it right now, but maybe defer voting on this until next Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=767)|
| 0:12:56| just so we know what we're voting on and the consequences of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| The letter won't be sent until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| I mean, I realize that probably this will be handled at the General Assembly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=783)|
| 0:13:09| and they'll have to answer some of those questions in more detail because this is just sort of a gesture to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=789)|
| 0:13:16| just so we all know what we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| When I sent the recommendation in, I also attached a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| I don't know if you all got it or not, what a scenic highway encompasses, but I did send in a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| It should be in the office, too, if you need to know what it does encompass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| Has Representative Dunn been notified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| Representative Dunn and I have already talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| and that was one of the things that we needed to work on is make sure that the public will speak to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=820)|
| 0:13:45| give them 30 days or so to come to us and speak to the people that it affects in the area right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=825)|
| 0:13:51| and then we send our recommendation on probably October, November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=831)|
| 0:13:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=848)|
| 0:14:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| Recently we, last month we talked about appointing a commission or a committee for fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=857)|
| 0:14:26| I'm going to have a discussion with the law director this week sometime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| and we'll try to bring that before you guys on the next, on this coming commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| the structure of that and kind of how that might look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| I want to get with him before we do that, so I'll add that as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| Hopefully it is an appointed committee soon after the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| Is there any other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| We did the item we added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| Resolution R-14-9-806 is added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=896)|
| 0:15:03| It's approving an easement agreement, granted a permanent easement, on property located at 600 Market Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=903)|
| 0:15:10| CLT number 0951E001 to 1 Center Square, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=910)|

| 0:15:23| Knox County will receive $5,920 for granting this easement to 1 Center Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=923)|
| 0:15:30| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=934)|

| 0:15:40| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| No, just at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| Line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| We have a spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| The Knox County Mayor's Order reappointing Anne Acuff to the Northeast Knox Utility District Board of Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=967)|
| 0:16:13| Okay, that doesn't require a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| Commissioner McKenzie, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| Yeah, just a question for the law directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| I'm looking at emails, and I don't know if this is just a turnover of office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| but we're getting a lot of public notices that I think aren't necessarily necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=987)|
| 0:16:36| Yeah, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| You know, baby showers and church meetings, and I don't want to belittle that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| but I would maybe ask if it is appropriate that if we issue some guidance as to when public notices are necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1004)|
| 0:16:55| I know folks want to do things in an abundance of caution, but I think we've kind of tipped the scales going the other way now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1015)|
| 0:17:07| I've noticed those too, and it's really at the pleasure of whatever board it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| I think right now there's been a concern that they weren't public noticing some things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| and they've had a few rough days as it relates to notice in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| Really, basically, the notices are required for the public to have enough time to make arrangements to attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1044)|
| 0:17:33| and thereby also have a knowledge of what's going to be discussed so that they can be prepared for what's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1053)|
| 0:17:40| That being said, these incidental meetings and going to church meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1060)|
| 0:17:47| and things where no deliberation would even be required or expected are not necessarily things that have to be noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1067)|
| 0:17:55| Sometimes people are in an abundance of caution because of our history, especially with commission, in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1075)|
| 0:18:04| which I think is in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| So we'll be glad to re-provide, if you will, some guidance to other boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1087)|
| 0:18:15| I think the county commission is a little more under the Fantzler order, a little more strenuous than other boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1095)|
| 0:18:22| and they may be looking at that as their guidance too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| You know, and I think one of the statements you just made I think is key,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| and it may help drive some of the behaviors of thought processes, is an agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| I think there needs to be an agenda, and if they can look at it maybe in that frame of reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1116)|
| 0:18:43| If there's no agenda other than you're going to take care of this baby that's about to be born| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| or enjoy the church service, then maybe one's not needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| So I would just ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| And I would like to build on that just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| Since we do have four new commissioners, we need this as a discussion item about sunshine just amongst us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1138)|
| 0:19:06| because the law director did say we were under a little bit different line of constraint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1146)|
| 0:19:17| Then really why I had my light on is I wanted to talk about the committee reassignments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1157)|
| 0:19:24| I see it in today's e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| The audit committee will meet September the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| That's a Wednesday at 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| And then I've been looking at all these others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| and I do not know when the next meeting of the IDB or whatever might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1178)|
| 0:19:45| I just wanted everyone to be aware of the fact that we may be on different committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| and maybe a little bit different schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| I think this gets back to what we were talking about, the noticing of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| And I think if 50 people showed up to somebody's baby shower that weren't invited, it might cause some issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1199)|
| 0:20:07| But I think to bring Judge Fansler's report and read it, and he mentioned specific things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| I mean, it's okay to talk about the baby shower, the lady vols, what you're doing on vacation, how your kids are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| But I think what they really were referring to in that, because this went over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| For those of us that came on in 2008, this was discussed in great detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| And it's like you said, it's where there's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| You may be voting on things, and there may be an opportunity for public discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| But in Judge Fansler's order, it did state that chance encounters or social encounters did not need to be noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1234)|
| 0:20:43| And I think also you're supposed to file a report afterwards, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| and somebody would need to take responsibility for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| Whoever called the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| If you have a call meeting, minutes are to be kept, notes of whether a vote was taken and what that result is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1255)|
| 0:21:02| If you have a meeting or a discussion, most of the time these extemporaneous meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1262)|
| 0:21:09| I know that Commissioner Broyles notices a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| But she says we're going to talk about something that's on the agenda, and that has to be sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| Another issue, too, that you all have a five-day rule for commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| which doesn't necessarily apply to other committees unless you all are on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1282)|
| 0:21:28| You see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| So there's a little nuances related to you that's not related to everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| But I'll look into it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| You know, sometimes, and I would agree with what's been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1302)|
| 0:21:50| the fact that if you're at a chance meeting or something, there's really no need to be noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1310)|
| 0:22:00| And like Sam said, if you are going to have a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| if I call Charles and say let's have lunch and discuss the zoo money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| then we need to notice that and have an agenda, because that is the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| We're going to discuss the zoo money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| And then we would have to take notes or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| But the other, you know, I would agree that that's not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| Commissioner Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| You know, being new on commission and just coming into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| and hearing about this as we got here, they said, okay, now you can't talk to anyone anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| I just think that's ridiculous that suddenly your hands are tied behind your back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| just being a human being almost just because you're serving on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| because of what's happened in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| What's happened in the past doesn't make it necessarily it's going to happen again to us if we're smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| And we've learned from the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| But I love Amy, but all of those notices, and I saw a school board notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| where two school board members are going to be in the same Sunday school class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| For heaven's sakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| When's it enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| Seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| I mean, it's like it's just overkill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| And too often a political body does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| It just makes it too hard to exist sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| I think it doesn't make any sense to go that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| Commissioner Oldman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| I agree with Mr. Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| I think when you open your email every single day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| and you have three or four or five public notice meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| you know, I'm glad that somebody's going to her baby shower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| but I really don't think the press wants to cover it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| I'm sure she doesn't want her baby shower or whatever covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| But I remember two years ago that we discussed this, and we had the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1441)|
| 0:24:08| I mean, we wanted our Republican Club meetings sunshined and all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1448)|
| 0:24:14| I don't know if Dave's going to show up at the same Republican Club I show up at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| or any other homeowner association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| Those are chance meetings in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| I shouldn't have to sunshine every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| I don't know what their agenda is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| I go to those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| I don't go there to discuss what's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| So I think we have took it to the extreme, and you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1471)|
| 0:24:38| Just because you're on commission doesn't mean I can't go up to Ed and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| hey, how's the family or how was the ball game last night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| That's not something that needs to be sunshined and reported back to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1487)|
| 0:24:55| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| Commissioner McKenzie, we added you to those two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1504)|
| 0:25:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140915?start=1517)|
