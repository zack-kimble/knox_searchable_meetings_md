| 0:00:30| being here and for anybody who may be watching at home on the community television. We'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=30)|
| 0:00:50| start with Councilman Camp and he will give the invocation and Councilman Saunders will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=50)|
| 0:00:55| lead us in the pledge. Please stand. We're thankful for another evening, another opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=55)|
| 0:01:02| to gather and serve our city. Let us be mindful of the needs of others and approach each issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=62)|
| 0:01:07| with an open mind. Amen. Please face the flag and render the salute. I pledge allegiance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=67)|
| 0:01:15| to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=75)|
| 0:01:21| nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Please call the roll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=81)|
| 0:01:30| Ms. Mitchell. Councilman Brown? Here. Councilman Campin? Here. Councilman Della Volpe? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=90)|
| 0:01:36| Councilman Grieve? Here. Councilman Palmer? Here. Vice Mayor Pavlis? Here. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| Saunders? Here. Councilman Steyer? Here. Councilman Wallace? Here. We are all here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=100)|
| 0:01:48| Is there a motion to approve the minutes? So moved. Second. A motion and a second. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=108)|
| 0:01:54| in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it. The minutes are approved. Are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=114)|
| 0:01:59| any items to be withdrawn? Items to be postponed? Yes. Councilman Della Volpe? Yes, Mayor. On| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=119)|
| 0:02:08| item number 10A, it is a hearing on appeal. I've spoken to both the original applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=128)|
| 0:02:16| before MPC and the appellant, and the applicant before MPC is agreeable and desirous of going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=136)|
| 0:02:24| back and coming back with a plan for the whole site, and that was one of the bones of contention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| that may resolve the dispute. But they're going to do that, and they ask for a 30-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=149)|
| 0:02:33| postponement so that they can get that done and submit the plan. 28 days? 28 days, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=153)|
| 0:02:40| a two-meeting postponement. Right, so we're going to postpone for 28 days. That's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| recommendation for 10A. Correct. A motion, is there a second? Second. We have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=164)|
| 0:02:50| and a second. All in favor of postponing for 28 days, item 10A, say aye. Aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=170)|
| 0:02:57| The ayes have it, and that is postponed. Anything else for postponement? How about added by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=177)|
| 0:03:03| motion? I have a motion to approve the consent items. Those are 11A, Certificate of Compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=183)|
| 0:03:11| 11B through Z for pensions, and 12B to 12H for 202s. So moved. Second. We have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=191)|
| 0:03:18| and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The consent items are approved. For| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| the Mayor's Report, I want to start by making sure everybody knows that this Thursday, June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=203)|
| 0:03:30| 27th, we'll be holding our annual business breakfast. This is something that is sponsored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=210)|
| 0:03:37| by our Purchasing Department for the businesses in our community. It starts at 7.30 a.m. and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=217)|
| 0:03:43| goes to 11.30. It is at the Knoxville Civic Coliseum, and the purpose is to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=223)|
| 0:03:49| that local business owners know what projects we will be funding, the kinds of bids that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| will be let out at the, you know, in the next 12 to 18 months, the kinds of services that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=234)|
| 0:04:01| the city or services or products that we might be procuring. So if you are a local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| business and you want to know, you wish to try and get some business from the city and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| provide some of the services that we need or products, then we encourage you to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| Again, it's this Thursday, June 27th, at the Civic Coliseum, starting at 7.30 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| We'll have a little bit of breakfast there for you, and the various department heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| will be there to talk about what their department will be doing over the next 12 to 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| So it's already July 4th coming up. Can you believe that? We're the year ago. So Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=271)|
| 0:04:37| of Special Events has been very busy planning the festival on the 4th. Everyone is invited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| to come on down to the World's Fair Park on Thursday, the 4th, to celebrate our nation's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| birthday. This year our festivities are beginning at 4 p.m. and will end after the fireworks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| show, and the fireworks will start at 9.35, on the dot, 9.35 p.m. The festival is presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=293)|
| 0:05:01| by One Main Financial, and we have a lot of other kinds of sponsors as well, and offers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| a variety of activities, including, I understand there will be a tug-of-war between the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| department and the police department. I'll be part of it. You're not going to be a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| of it? I have a feeling Kevin Faddis is going to be on the fire department. I'd say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=315)|
| 0:05:24| Also, speaking of the police department, we want to welcome our newest deputy chief, Monty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| Houck. He's here at our meeting tonight for Chief Roush, so we want to again congratulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=330)|
| 0:05:37| him and his new role. This is the first time here, so don't ask him too tough of a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| although I'm sure he will be prepared for whatever. How long have you been with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| department, Monty? Twenty-four years. Twenty-four years, so he knows a lot. So thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=347)|
| 0:05:53| being here. He wears his vest when he comes. I don't know if you have it. He wears the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| vest. Okay, and you may remember, at the end of last year, City Council adopted the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| 2012 International Construction Codes, ICC, International Construction Codes, right, with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=362)|
| 0:06:10| local amendments, and that was passed. And during the meeting, there was a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| table the adoption of the 2012 International Green Construction Code to allow time to study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=375)|
| 0:06:22| the Green Code and its impact on our various stakeholders. A task force was formed, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| it has now completed its review of the International Green Construction Code. And Christy Branscom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| our COO and deputy to the mayor, is here with some of the findings and to introduce members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| of the task force. Thank you very much. Yes, we did assemble a group called the Green Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| Task Force to study the Green Code. It was new in 2012. It was the first time it had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=404)|
| 0:06:50| been published. But we did convene this group to study it in depth and to provide a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| back to City Council. I'd like to recognize those members who were in that group. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| myself, Mr. Tom Reynolds, Deputy Director of Permits and Inspections for the City of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| Knoxville, Mr. Brent Johnson, Engineering Planning Chief, City of Knoxville, Glenn Richter's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=425)|

| 0:07:25| Smith, Executive Vice President, Johnson & Galleon Construction and representative of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| Associated General Contractors of Tennessee, Knoxville Chapter, Mr. John Kinney, President| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| of Facility Systems Consultants, LLC, and a Mechanical Engineering Representative, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| John Gattis, Senior Associate Architect with McCarty-Hulstaple-McCarty and Chair of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| Building Board of Adjustments and Appeals, and Mr. Brad Salisbury, Vice President, Cannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| & Cannon and Civil Engineering Representative. The task force met every other Thursday at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| four o'clock beginning on February 14, 2013, to really do an in-depth review of this newly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| published code. Each member was assigned specific sections to study and review the code based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| on their expertise, and then that member presented their findings to the group and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| reviewed each code section's expected level of impact on the various stakeholders, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| that would be the owner, the designer, the contractor, and the city. And we have presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| that information to all of you via email, and I also have hard copies here this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| but I just want to say before we get into the substantive review is I really want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| say thank you to this group. They all participated in the process. It did take a lot of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=512)|
| 0:08:39| and it wasn't always easy to understand what the Green Code was trying to tell us, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| this group remained dedicated, and I really do appreciate their work. I'd like to invite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| Glenn Richters and Beth Eason. They're going to give us a review of the summary that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| been presented and give us their opinions on the Green Code. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=534)|
| 0:09:00| Thank you. Mr. Richters, thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| First, we'd like to say thank you to all of you for updating our codes in the first place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| to even bringing the 2012 ICC codes into effect. That's a major step for the city, and we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=550)|
| 0:09:18| appreciate it, especially the design people who have to deal with multiple codes and multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| locations. We very much appreciate that. As Christy said, our goal was to evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| the IGCC, specifically 2012 IGCC, for its appropriateness to be adopted by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=568)|
| 0:09:37| Our task force divided up the code. We divided it into chapters that gave it to individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=577)|
| 0:09:44| whose field of expertise covered those chapters. They then studied it and analyzed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=584)|
| 0:09:52| Then came back to the task force as a whole, and the task force sat down and each week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| we would review another chapter of the code. So we went through it very thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| We looked at it in three ways. The first was that we looked at what was new and what was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| existing. The code incorporates elements of other codes and other zoning ordinances, storm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| warning ordinances, into it. So not all the elements of the Green Construction Code are new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=613)|
| 0:10:21| So we evaluated which are new and which are not. And then with those that were new, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=621)|
| 0:10:26| looked at what the burden that was being imposed upon development was. And we looked at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=626)|
| 0:10:33| from a cost standpoint, we looked at it from a time scheduling standpoint, and we looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| at it from an administrative paperwork standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| The third aspect we looked at is the benefit. And when we look at codes, we usually think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=642)|
| 0:10:50| regulations burden. But the reality is that these regulations are written with an intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| to benefit the community. So we also looked at what the benefits were, and then we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| weigh that against what the impact are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| I won't go into detail on that. You all have the report. You've read it or can read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=666)|
| 0:11:14| If you have any specific questions, we'll be glad to answer those. But suffice it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| say that there are a lot of new regulations that are incorporated in this code. Those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| new regulations bring a burden to the design community and to owners in terms of the education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=683)|
| 0:11:31| requirements that are involved in it. We have a big learning curve that has to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| We have that with the 2012 codes in general, and this is an additional add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=696)|
| 0:11:44| Some of these regulations have cost impacts. Some of them do not have cost impacts. Some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| are easy to achieve, and we do it in most projects as it is, but some are more difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=710)|
| 0:11:57| and then some are actually fairly onerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| And then thirdly, there's an administrative aspect to this, and I know that Tom Reynolds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| would love to talk about it for a while, but the thing that you have to understand about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| the IGCC is that it's an overlay code. It is not a stand-alone code, and it does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=734)|
| 0:12:22| replace other codes. It is on top of other codes, just like the historic zoning overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| is on top of the zoning ordinance. So it doesn't remove the existing burden of code review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=748)|
| 0:12:35| it just adds another layer to it. So we have the additional time and effort that's involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=755)|
| 0:12:42| in that, and in this particular case, of course, we also have the learning curve involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| it. On top of that, this is the first pass for this code. It's the first time it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=767)|
| 0:12:55| approved and been issued out. There are, like many things that are issued for the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=775)|
| 0:13:02| time, there are issues that have not been resolved. And as we went through the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| we found out that there were conflicts with our existing codes and regulations. So we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| have zoning issues that have to be resolved. We have storm water issues that need to resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=792)|
| 0:13:20| Other conflicts that exist between this code and our existing regulations. In addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=800)|
| 0:13:27| to that, the policies and procedures to implement the code haven't been evolved yet. So there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=807)|
| 0:13:35| a series of requirements, regulations to document and support decisions that are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=815)|
| 0:13:42| And it's not clear at all whose responsibility that is, what the reporting mechanism will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| This all has to be resolved by the code administration. So in tackling this, without proper education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=828)|
| 0:13:59| without proper lead time, without case studies to evaluate, we're very concerned that implementing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=839)|
| 0:14:09| this code would be difficult to do and be successful at. So our recommendation is that the IGCC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=849)|
| 0:14:20| the 2012 IGCC, is not ready to be adopted as a mandatory code in the city. We do, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=860)|
| 0:14:29| feel that it should be adopted as a voluntary code. In conjunction with that, most importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=869)|
| 0:14:39| is that we think the city needs to look to the future and that we need to develop a three-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=879)|
| 0:14:47| that will prepare us to move forward. Sustainability issues are critical. Twenty years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=887)|
| 0:14:54| we barely talked about it. Now it's a current conversation. LEED has developed the U.S. Green Building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=894)|
| 0:15:02| Council's measurement system of LEED. It's being incorporated into our codes. The International Energy Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| is more stringent than ever before. There's a constant growth of awareness and concern about sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=908)|
| 0:15:16| issues. This is only going to increase. It's not going to decrease. And so the city has the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=916)|
| 0:15:24| here to prepare ourselves for the future and to move forward in a studied manner. So sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=924)|
| 0:15:35| is important. It creates economic vitality. It helps us be financially sound by our operations and maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=935)|
| 0:15:44| and reducing the burden on our infrastructure. It also increases the quality of our environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| and the health of our citizens. So all these things are important issues. And the city has the opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| and I know the mayor feels very strongly about this, that we can move forward and be a leader in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=956)|
| 0:16:03| But it takes a little bit of planning and time. And that's what we propose is that over the next three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| that we develop a plan that has four parts of it. The first part is that we refine, we develop our policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=969)|
| 0:16:18| and procedures for those practices, those sustainability practices that are already incorporated in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=978)|
| 0:16:25| We have stormwater regulations that are coming down from the state that we need to learn how to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| We need to learn how to develop the policies and procedures for those. The 2012 International Energy Conservation Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=991)|
| 0:16:38| which is part of the whole package that was adopted, has new, stiffer regulations in terms of our efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=998)|
| 0:16:47| We need to learn how to deal with those and how to implement those practices. So that's one element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1007)|
| 0:16:55| The second element, which is most key, is education. We have a lot of learning to do. I practiced architecture for 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1015)|
| 0:17:04| and nothing ever changed. I think the biggest change we had was that they invented nail guns. That was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1024)|
| 0:17:11| But in the last 10 years, there's been tremendous learning in what goes into a building and what affects our environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1031)|
| 0:17:20| It's really quite astounding. And so the learning curve is also quite large for us. And we need time to incorporate those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1040)|
| 0:17:28| What goes into a building envelope? What goes into energy recovery? We have the ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1048)|
| 0:17:38| We have a whole series of professional organizations, the U.S. Green Building Council, the American Institute of Architects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| engineering societies. We're all there and we can team together with the city to help provide education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| and education to those who need it the most. The code officials will need it, the owners will need it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| the design teams will need it, and the contractors will need it. Those are key pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| The third element that we would like to see adopted are case studies. The best way to learn anything is to actually do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1083)|
| 0:18:12| And we feel that there's opportunities and the city can search out for opportunities to use the International Green Building Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1092)|
| 0:18:22| From the city's own facilities, one opportunity. We would like to see the city require that their own facilities lead and set the standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1102)|
| 0:18:34| and be used as test cases to help develop the system. So whether it's using a higher level of achievement lead system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1114)|
| 0:18:44| which doesn't require as much burden upon the code officials, or it's the International Green Building Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1124)|
| 0:18:53| we feel the city should take the lead and use their facilities to help teach and learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1133)|
| 0:19:01| The second is, on the private side, to look for opportunities where we can create incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1141)|
| 0:19:09| And we understand a balance has to be struck in terms of overburdening projects. We want to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1149)|
| 0:19:19| But the city has tools in their repertoire that they can use to help incentivize the use of these codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1159)|
| 0:19:30| And then finally, fourthly, is public awareness, public input. After all, in the end, it's the public that's the driver behind all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1170)|
| 0:19:39| They're the ones who benefit the most from it. And so public outreach, as was performed in the original codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1179)|
| 0:19:47| to reach out to all the professional organizations and all the trade organizations that are involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| and also public, to hold public hearings. And then, you know, use social media and the websites, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| to educate and to get feedback from the public. So that was our findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1198)|
| 0:20:09| And if you have any questions, I'd be glad to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| Thank you, Mr. Richters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Yes, thank you, Mr. Richters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| It was obvious that you guys put a lot of work into looking at this, analyzing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| trying to anticipate the unintended consequences, which might actually hurt ongoing building until we get up to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1222)|
| 0:20:30| And I appreciate your thoughtfulness on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| I think the other aspect of this green code is that most of the codes that we have in place are built up over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1234)|
| 0:20:42| They come out every five or ten years, and they embody good practice as we have from learning from mistakes, in part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1242)|
| 0:20:51| I mean, if we have buildings crack or fail or leak or rot, we develop codes to teach us the minimum things we have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1251)|
| 0:20:59| to be sure that doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| This is kind of another direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| It's a new code that's kind of trying to, what, push us forward to experiment to do better in the area of sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1264)|
| 0:21:12| But I appreciate your caution because we are a little bit in an area where it's unproven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| And so we want to be watching what other jurisdictions are doing, like you said, perhaps some case studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1278)|
| 0:21:25| but to have a good grounding before we leap in because we don't want to discourage development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1285)|
| 0:21:31| nor do we want to unduly burden it and, you know, send it somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| We want to do wise, good development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| And so I think your idea of putting it in place as a kind of something to reach for, as an ideal or a goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1297)|
| 0:21:44| or at least a test or explain why you're doing it one way as opposed to another, I think that's healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| I think that gets the profession across the board, whether it's designers or builders or inspectors across the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1309)|
| 0:21:56| to learn the new game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| So I appreciate your caution in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| Thank you, guys, for what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| And thank you, Mr. Richards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| This is exactly the approach that I think is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| An education of all your components or three of those components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| So I think that is absolutely essential that we in Knoxville become a more attractive place to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1334)|
| 0:22:24| and do it correctly and sustainably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| So I applaud you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| I think this is fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| And I think it will take a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| And I hope the city will take the lead on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| And I think we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| And, again, I want to thank you, Glenn and Beth Eason, who's out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| and any other members of the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| She let you do all the talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| But thank you all for the time you put into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| and, of course, the leadership of Christy Branscombe on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| And I will say Christy did a great job of herding us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| It was herd, not hurt, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| Now for council reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| Vice Mayor Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| I just wanted to let everybody know about two good events this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| One of them is at IM's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| It's the Metal Ark Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| It's a day of music, food, and local artists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| I believe this is the third year that it's been held there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| There will be eight bands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| It begins at 2 o'clock and ends at 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| The good news is tickets are $10 in advance, but they're $20 a day of the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| Student tickets are $5 in advance and $10 at the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| and you must have, you know, your ID proving that you're a student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| Children 12 and under are free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| So it's a family-friendly event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| and I encourage everyone to start the day out with my coffee with the councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1431)|
| 0:23:58| at the famous Roundup Restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| I'll be there from 9 to 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| and anybody can drop by and have some good breakfast and fellowship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| and talk about whatever you want to talk about with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| And I say all this just to assure everybody that South Knoxville is open for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| That it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| Once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| Once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| First of all, I want to thank those people who came to the six-district meeting this past Thursday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| at the L.T. Ross Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| Thank David Brace and Chief Rausch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1470)|

| 0:29:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| And that is that this and 10A, which we postponed, I think for a good reason, to have further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1800)|
| 0:30:07| looking at what needs to be done, are part of a planned development district approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| And we're looking at property that's been given an RP1 designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1813)|
| 0:30:20| And in that regard, if you look at our zoning ordinances, they are looking to develop land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1820)|
| 0:30:28| under Article 4, Section 3, and, in fact, 3.01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1828)|

| 0:31:03| we only have two buildings being put on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| One of the criteria that you see in our zoning ordinance, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| is that in approving something like a duplex or other type of unit that you're looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1870)|
| 0:31:17| among other things, compatibility with existing structures in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| And I think that's where some of the – and you can look at 3.1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| but each planned unit development shall be compatible with the surrounding or adjacent districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| And it's that idea of using land in a more unique way, in an inventive or imaginative way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1892)|
| 0:31:39| that solves environmental problems but still keeps the character of the community intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1899)|
| 0:31:46| And I want us to focus on that as we listen because there are good people on both sides of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| There's a family that wants to develop two duplexes that they're going to use as income for their retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| There's a community group that's concerned about not really having any input into the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1917)|
| 0:32:04| And there's some question from one of the neighbors who may or may not be here as to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| being impacted either by water coming from the project or just the idea that perhaps a duplex is not in keeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1930)|
| 0:32:18| And those are all debatable on both sides of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| But I think that's the framework we're talking in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| So I wanted to make those preliminary remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| We'll first hear from the Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| We have Bob Wolfenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| Hey, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| And Ronnie Collins is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| And you all know by council rules I will start the timer for five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| But state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| I'm Bob Wolfenbarger, 3200 Lexan Lane, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| I'm here on behalf of Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| I would be speaking with Ronnie Collins here, but he's tied up in a truck up the country somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1971)|
| 0:32:58| Oh, he's behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| He's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| Just made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| Councilman Della Volpe made the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| And I think, you know, we are dealing with good people on both sides of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| And we invited them to meet with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| And at the moment in time probably they didn't think it was the appropriate thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| We wish they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| The basic concern we have with this development, and as you can see in the handout that I handed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2000)|
| 0:33:29| I didn't know that at the moment in time that our councilman was going to speak directly to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2009)|
| 0:33:36| But it's about the character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| And the duplexes we understand in infill development, that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| We've seen it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| But if duplexes are going to come to our neighborhood or any developments are going to come to our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| we wanted to build it up, make it better than it is, not make it worse than it is, not detract from its aesthetics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2031)|
| 0:33:58| and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| And our view is that these duplexes sitting perpendicular to the street are not in keeping with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2039)|
| 0:34:07| They diminish the aesthetics from the neighbor across the road who happens to be here this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| in turn diminishing the value of the properties around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| Our hope is that these folks will reconsider, reposition these two units, which will be a total of four homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2058)|
| 0:34:26| and make them aesthetically pleasing to the neighborhood as opposed to the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| And I think we can all get along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| Thank you, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| Mr. Collins, you're not going to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| So now for the other side, we have Mr. Seymour and Ms. Currie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| Is that how you pronounce it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| Currie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Currie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| And if I may, Anthony Leisure, who's a licensed general contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| I did not see Mr. Leisure until after I'd signed up, and I think he would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| I'll reference his testimony, and if you all have questions from him, maybe you can ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2105)|
| 0:35:12| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| Or let him speak for himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| Well, you can have up to three people speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| I guess I should ask Mr. Wolfenbarger, was there anybody, since Mr. Collins isn't speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| is there anybody else that you wish to have to speak for your?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| If anybody has a question, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| Is that the woman that appeared at MPC and made her statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| So she's available if anyone should have a question later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| Mr. Seymour, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| I'm on the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| Mayor, members of council, I am here on behalf of Mrs. Currie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| She and her husband are the property owners of this 1.6 acres of property on Valley View Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2145)|
| 0:35:54| There was an older house on the property, as you can see from the site plan for these two duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2154)|
| 0:36:02| That home was in disrepair and, after consultation with certain inspection officials, was removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| Her plan is to put two duplexes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| If you look at the site plan, and, by the way, this is plan residential, RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| If you look at the site plan, there is a drainage easement on the west side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| That precludes reorienting the front duplex, as Mr. Wolfenbarger has suggested, unless done at great expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2185)|
| 0:36:38| There is a drainage easement on the west side of her lot that will be 15 feet wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| that handles runoff from the ridge just to the north of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2204)|
| 0:36:50| That is a wet weather conveyance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| It's not a blue line stream, but in times like we've had this spring, it does carry a great deal of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2213)|
| 0:37:01| If the home was to be oriented, as Mr. Wolfenbarger has suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2221)|
| 0:37:10| and according to Mr. Leisure, a licensed general contractor, and I'll come to him in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| that area of the lot stays saturated in wet weather times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| To build in that area would require engineered footings and sump pumps to keep the crawl spaces dry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2242)|
| 0:37:30| and probably would interfere with the drainage from the nearby ridge line down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| The property slopes from the east to the west in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| Mr. Leisure is a licensed general contractor in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| His license is half a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| He does residential work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| He does small commercial work, and he is the proposed builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| And Mr. Leisure, after consultation, determined, and I might just get you to affirm this, Mr. Leisure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| that the construction of the duplex, as Mr. Wolfenbarger suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| could damage other property owners and would make this building impractical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| If you look at Valley View Drive, you have single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| You have apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| You have condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| It's a mixed residential area, a very nice residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| The condominium projects, if you look at your zoning map, one just to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| I don't think any of the properties there face Valley View Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2313)|
| 0:38:39| There is another condominium project to the northwest here, and none of those particularly face the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2319)|
| 0:38:47| There is one that is a foreclosure immediately to the west and immediately to the south of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2327)|
| 0:38:54| When it is built, none of those homes, according to the concept plan, would face Valley View Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2334)|
| 0:39:02| They would all face an internal street structure at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| So we think this is compatible with the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| The only reason alleged in the appeal notice filed by Mr. Wolfenbarger is that it does not fulfill the zoning regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2354)|
| 0:39:26| otherwise unspecified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| We submit that it does, that based upon expert contractors' opinions, which, Mr. Leisure, I've summarized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2369)|
| 0:39:39| would not make it practical to build the way Mr. Wolfenbarger has suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2379)|
| 0:39:45| Mr. Leisure, would you come up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| You have about 50 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| Are the statements I've made about construction of this duplex correct, in your opinion, as a licensed general contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2391)|
| 0:40:02| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| Would it be practical to have this first duplex face Valley View Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| The cost would run so high from the return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| Obviously, you're building a duplex for return, and the cost would be so exorbitant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| You've got about a 10 to 12-foot fall on the opposite side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| And I'll turn it over to Ms. Currie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| Do you want to say anything at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| That's our case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| That's all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| I'm going to stop on the record before the MPC and the MPC staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| One thing we did want to say that Ms. Currie, go ahead and speak and say your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2442)|
| 0:40:48| Stephanie Currie, 3927 Valley View Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| We only live three houses down from where we're building the duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| We've lived in the neighborhood for over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| So this is not something we want to detriment our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| You're talking about property values that also affects us as a homeowner in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| But the property also that's not included, as you look, it sits back off the road over 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| It's not something that's sitting on the road, distracting from the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| if they're concerned about just the aesthetics of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| It's sitting far enough back that it's not going to be right in your sight view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2474)|
| 0:41:20| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| Now, Mr. Wolfenbarger, you all have up to two minutes for rebuttals, if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2482)|
| 0:41:31| I think that I would refer to the regulations because Mr. Seymour made an issue that this, you know, meets all the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2491)|
| 0:41:39| And if you read the regulations, I hope you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| I have the copy that Mr. DellaVolpe sent me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| But Section 3 of its 3.0.3, I would suppose, but it states what the general standards are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2506)|
| 0:41:59| And Standard 2, the uses are in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the zoning regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| And the zoning regulation, if these two lots were one lot, we'd be having a whole different discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2525)|
| 0:42:13| But because they're single lots, it sort of becomes a gray area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2533)|
| 0:42:19| But the third component of this thing, it says it is compatible with the character of the neighborhood in Section 3.0.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2539)|
| 0:42:30| And sitting these things perpendicular to the street is not in keeping in character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| We'd hope that you'd help us continue to uplift our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| And the expenses shouldn't be an issue here, in our opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2560)|
| 0:42:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| That ends the formal comment period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| And, Councilman DellaVolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| If Ms. Celeste, looking at my notes from the MPC hearing, and a young lady appeared there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2575)|
| 0:43:03| and told the MPC that she was concerned about the duplexes not being the face of that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2583)|
| 0:43:12| and the immediate blocks around there, if you drive around those neighborhoods, you see mostly single-family houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2592)|
| 0:43:19| mostly facing the road, would you tell us about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| Please state your name and address first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| And I am the owner of 3908 Valley View Drive, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| Where is that in relationship to this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| That is the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| That is the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| I have lived in this house my entire life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| My parents built this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| So I am intimately familiar with this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| I have basically 60 years of knowledge of this neighborhood because of my parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| It was all single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| The house was built prior to when the property was inside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2628)|
| 0:43:55| These people built out in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| And, therefore, the lots are larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| If you look at the lots, they are all larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| That whole corner there, there's a whole square there from Knox Lane over to the east side of 3908 Valley View Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2642)|
| 0:44:10| and they're all owned by the same person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| But all of those houses face the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| And when you go down Valley View, if you are looking at multiple units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| they're behind each other and they are facing the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| What this gentleman was speaking of, these developments that are perpendicular to the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| all of those developments, with the exception of one small one, are on side streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2670)|
| 0:44:37| They are not on Valley View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| These are streets that go off of Valley View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| Well, therefore, those houses face the street that they are on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| And, you know, it just, it would be, to me, it would be foolish to make all of these houses that are facing the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2689)|
| 0:45:05| It just looks like that all of a sudden you've just dropped a box in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| There's not going to be an aesthetic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| And for those of us that live in the neighborhood, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| why do we want to look at basically somebody's backyard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| Because if you have duplexes sitting perpendicular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| they don't have to see my backyard, quote, unquote, from the street because my house hides my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2724)|
| 0:45:32| And you know how people are with their backyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| But it just simply is not in keeping with the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| Most of those houses were built in the 50s and the 60s, and they look it and they have been kept up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| And everybody around there is a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| There's not a renter within two blocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| And I just don't feel like looking at the end of someone's house is going to be pleasing to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2751)|
| 0:45:58| You also mentioned you were concerned about water reaching you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| You're across the street, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| Yes, I am across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| And that wet weather drainage that they are speaking of crosses underneath Valley View and drains onto my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2764)|
| 0:46:14| And the house next door floods now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| Next door to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| Not next door to me, next door to this property that they're wanting to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| Because of the water issues, that house now floods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2784)|
| 0:46:30| Their basement floods every time we have a bad rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| And I just feel like if you disturb that land a whole lot more, you're going to destroy that person's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2793)|
| 0:46:40| Basically, you're causing property damage to your neighbor next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| And I don't think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| If I could ask Mr. Wolfenbarger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| you indicated that the applicant before MPC had not come to speak to the Alice Bell Spring Hill Community Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2814)|
| 0:47:04| No, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| Can you tell us about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| Did you offer to have them come there and postpone this thing so that it could be discussed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| Actually, at the MPC meeting, I provided counsel another opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| I provided them a copy of the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| The council members at our neighborhood association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| A copy of the minutes from that meeting because I specifically asked the contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| and Ms. Currie's husband to come to the next Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2846)|
| 0:47:35| which was about two weeks away, and discuss this matter with us rather than pursue it at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2855)|
| 0:47:42| And unpolitely and vigorously, he declined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| And so since that time, I believe I contacted you, Mr. Del Lope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2867)|
| 0:47:56| and we did meet you and I met with them at their property and had this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| But I will say this neighborhood association, as most of you already know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| are willing and hopeful that anybody that has something going on in our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| will come to us and discuss it and see if we can never get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| This is not where we'd like to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| Well, let me ask you another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| Mr. Leeser, I guess, the builder, indicated that it was not, I don't know if he said possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2900)|
| 0:48:28| but certainly more expensive and difficult to put the buildings facing towards the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| Can you tell me if that lot, which this diagram shows is about 160 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| could accommodate the buildings facing towards the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| It will accommodate the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| And there's no doubt, based on the discussion that you and I and he had on that particular evening we met, it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2924)|
| 0:48:51| It's just that it's going to incur some more expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| They're going to have to involve an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| They're going to have to involve probably some infill, maybe some minor stormwater management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| But, you know, that's the cost of doing business if you're in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| And a rental property is a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| And we look at it, whether it's Mr. Graham down at Home Depot doing a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2947)|
| 0:49:14| or some entrepreneurs trying to figure out how to do a development, it's still business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2954)|
| 0:49:22| And if it's a business expense, no matter what business any of us are in, we have to incur those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| And we regret it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| But we understand that that's the nature of doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| But for most of the people in this neighborhood, their business, their primary business is their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| And they're trying to protect that investment and that value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| and that's all we're here about is trying to protect our investment and our value of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2983)|
| 0:49:50| Is your community group available if they still want to talk to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| Always, always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| Mr. Collins or myself, you all, everybody has our phone numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| They're welcome to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| We're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| I meant the actual community group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| Does it meet in the summer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| Actually, we're going to meet again when, Ronnie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| We forgot to announce about this meeting, as a matter of fact, because we forgot we weren't having a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| So in August we'll have another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| And when is that normally held?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| It's on the third Monday of each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| I think that's all I have, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| I certainly would urge my colleagues to consider the possibility that this could be postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3025)|
| 0:50:32| or deferred while there's a follow-up meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| It's been my experience this community group has tried to work with builders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| and developers and come to some mutual understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| They really didn't have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| Like I said, there are good people on both sides of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| and both of them are trying to do the right thing, and they're judging it by perhaps their own standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| But we have an area where it's mostly single-family homes, and they mostly face the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3056)|
| 0:51:05| And it's true what Mrs. Curry said, that they will try to set it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3065)|
| 0:51:10| Now, I don't know whether they plan to put a third building on there in the future or not, but they have them set back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| But if you look at the diagram, you'll see that this lot is roughly 159 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3075)|
| 0:51:23| and the builder indicated that maybe 15 feet is a flowage easement that he couldn't build on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3083)|
| 0:51:29| I accept that as correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| Most of the buildings, or the two buildings you've shown, look to be between 64 and 80 feet long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| So if you put them sideways, there's still plenty of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| If you take the 15 feet off 159, you're down to 144, and there's plenty of room to put a 64- and 84-foot building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3100)|
| 0:51:49| So it is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| There is a cost consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| I don't mean to demean it because I know this family doesn't want to spend money it doesn't want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| but it also has to take into account in a planned development the idea that you're trying to be compatible with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3116)|
| 0:52:04| surrounding and adjacent districts and the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| And I think that's an important factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| Maybe MPC didn't put enough weight on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| I want to ask the question, and the people are obviously not here, but there's a house right beside this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3135)|
| 0:52:23| and I'm going to ask the lady who spoke before, Mr. Wolfenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| You live on Valley View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| Could you come back to the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| Have you talked to your neighbors that would be across the street that are beside where this property would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| How do they feel about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| Well, they are very elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| I am basically the youngest property owner whose property is even close to this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| The lady on the east side is probably in her 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| The people on the west side are the lady is disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| She's way up in her 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| And the lady across the street at 3914, she's also way up in her 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| And so it's difficult for them to come and talk to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| Have you talked to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| I have talked to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| The one on the east side that's right beside it, have you talked with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| I have not talked with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| I have talked with people on the west side, and I have talked with the lady directly across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| And they are not happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| They are very unhappy about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| And, you know, going back to the aesthetics situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| there was a single-family home that was sitting on this property for years and years and years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| And there was a driveway that, you know, if you extended that driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| you could have duplexes facing the street, one behind the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3219)|
| 0:53:45| Well, I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| Maybe I should have gone over there and knocked on the door and asked them myself how they felt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| I didn't know, so you have not talked to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| I have not talked to Mrs. McDaniel, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| She's the person that owns the brick house, the brick front house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| She is very elderly, and she will not answer her door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| Good thing I didn't knock on her door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| You may have a shotgun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3248)|
| 0:54:09| But now the housers to the west, they would have answered you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| and Mrs. Neskow, who is in the white house that has the really long lot beside of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| she would have answered you, and she's very upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| She doesn't want to be looking at these things all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| She doesn't want to be looking at the end of somebody's house all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| You know, it's a tough situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| Once again, we find ourselves in a land use issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| and there's no question that the majority of the homes up and down that neighborhood face the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3275)|
| 0:54:42| and putting it on a sideways like they're proposing is not compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| It's not good infill development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| And as much as I respect anyone trying to build houses and rent them out, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| it's just this doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| And I can't go along with approval based on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| It's just not good infill development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| Sir, by council rules, one of the council members will have to call on you before we can have you speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| Who is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| Who are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| Who are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| I'm Raymond Turner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| I'm at 3900 Saylor Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| I'm right off of Valley View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| I'll move to recognize him, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| Where's his address again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| It's 3900 Saylor Court, S-A-Y-L-O-R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| We're right at the head of Valley View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| We practically live on the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| We have a set of condominiums that are not facing Valley View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| Now, I know that it's on Saylor Court, which how it's set up is a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| But we have the end unit, and our unit is on the side of Valley View Drive, and it does not face Valley View Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3355)|
| 0:56:05| We've lived there for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| We are about to put it up for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| We've known the Currys for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| We go to church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| They do a lot of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| They're really nice people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| And I don't think that they're going to devalue the land whatsoever, whether they're horizontal or vertical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| I mean there's plenty of apartment complexes that are not facing the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| And there's runoff of water all down Valley View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| It's from beginning to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| It's not just in one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| The whole ridgeline washes over the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| So I don't see that their particular development is going to cause a problem with just that isolated event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3403)|
| 0:56:50| The whole area actually needs to be reconstructed as far as drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| KEB actually had to fix our drainage, and it took us a long time to get that fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3415)|
| 0:57:01| So I don't think that's actually their problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| And I think that the duplexes will actually look pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| I think it would make the place look a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| There are some houses in there that do need to be worked on that kind of degrade the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| Because we've already had some studies done because we've got to sell our condo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| So I guess that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| I would agree with Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| I just don't feel this development is compatible with the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| and adjacent districts as required by the ordinance, the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3457)|
| 0:57:43| So unless there's some push to postpone this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| I would make a motion to approve the appeal by the Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3468)|
| 0:57:57| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| More conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| I just want to reiterate what Councilman Wallace had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| And if any of my colleagues had an opportunity to drive out through there, it's a wonderful neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3488)|
| 0:58:14| The houses do face the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| And the concern that I would have is that it's like anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| If we do this once, then what's the next one going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| And if you look at the size of the lots down through there, that's possible for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3503)|
| 0:58:29| And so I think the aesthetics of the neighborhood, I think that's one thing that we need to work on to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3509)|
| 0:58:36| And I think it's important that it seems to me that there ought to be a way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| and maybe the groups can get together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| but it seems to me that there is a way in which they can still do their duplexes on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| I don't think that we're making them have a hardship in this particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| So I support the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| Vice Mayor or Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| Well, which one wants to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| I'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| I mean, I'm sitting here counting noses, and I'm thinking that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| it's either going to seem like it's going to go down and approve the appeal or the two parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3545)|
| 0:59:12| It concerns me that they're not willing to at least sit down at the table and have a reasonable discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3552)|
| 0:59:19| So, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| Could I have Ms. Curry respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| Although she's got four or five homes in the neighborhood and has lived there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| she was not aware of a neighborhood association until the NPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| No, I was not aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| So we couldn't meet with them because I was not aware they were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| We have also brought some other neighbors of ours who were also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| none of them were aware that we had a neighborhood association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| Our sign was up in the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| Nobody contacted us until the NPC meeting at which time it was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| And then after we filed the appeal, we met with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| Our builder tried to explain to him the depth of that wet area where he wants to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| And feasibly, financially, I don't know that we can afford to build it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| It has always been a rental property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| We have owned it since 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| It was a dilapidated house that we tore down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| It was no longer, it was getting to the point where it was not livable, so we tore it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3610)|
| 1:00:17| But along that street, you talk about aesthetics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| There is everything on that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| We have lived there for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| And that, we do like our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| It's convenient, but there is everything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| At the other end of the street, on the street, there are low-income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| There are Section 8 apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| So this is not detrimental to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| In fact, what we tore down is going to be beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| There are things, yes, most single-family homes do face the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| but we are not building, we are building a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| Our tenants are all long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| They help keep up the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| Most of our tenants have lived in our house for 16, 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| We're good landlords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| We keep up our properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| We don't let anything fall and disappear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| Like I said, we live three doors down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| We don't want this to fall down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| That will hurt our property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| We are committed to living in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| I would like to, but the Home Association never contacted us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| And also, speaking to the immediate neighbors on either side of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| we have a good relationship with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| and we spoke to both of them when we tore the house down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| They don't have a problem with the duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| We explained what we were doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| especially the one that you mentioned that is right beside it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| She is fine with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| The other neighbors on the other side, we know each other's grasp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| We get along fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| I mean, nobody in the immediate side-by-side has an issue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| We have spoken to all those neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| because we have been in the neighborhood for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| Okay, I'm confused then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| You all have met with the Neighborhood Association or have not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| We have met after the Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| At that time, we were approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| We were going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| After we got the appeal, we met with the Neighborhood Association at the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| and we tried to explain to them the difficulties of building those facing the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| That is such a low, wet spot that is physically really not able to do with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| and it is going to harm the drainage that we get from that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3729)|
| 1:02:14| Around the back of the ridge, most of the properties back up to Sharps Ridge there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| and it all drains down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| We have a runoff stream in our yard that we have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| If you build there, we will have either constantly having issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| with flooding in our basements there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| or we'll have issues with it getting backed up and not draining appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| The groundwater there will be stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| It won't drain away as easily as it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| because right now it has a place to go until it gets absorbed into the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| It's not that we have a problem with it facing forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| If we could face it forward, we would, but it's not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| The cost won't be beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| We will just have to leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| What's possible is just costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| Costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| In our financial situation, we're not a big builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| We're not a big development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| We're only planning on putting two duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| That's all we ever plan to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| I don't want to manage a huge development because we could put more there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3788)|
| 1:03:17| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| I'm a little bit confused about the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| because I've heard one person say that there are no rental properties in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| Now I'm hearing that, yes, we have some rental properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| So clearly there are rental properties in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| There's two duplexes a block away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| A block away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| You go down Knox and they're on Knox Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| There's two duplexes right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| There's condos that most of those have turned rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| So rental is not a new concept for this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| It may not be a comfortable concept for the old-timers in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| but it is part of the life there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| There's lots of rental houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| A lot of the houses are rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| You can see the tenants coming and going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| Our tenants are long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| Like Vice Mayor Pavlis, I'm concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| and I'm sure that Councilman de la Voca is also concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| I really think that we need to have some kind of an attempt for the two parties to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3850)|
| 1:04:17| and be very serious about the concerns that are raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| The property owners who cannot afford to build, perhaps, to the specifications of some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3862)|
| 1:04:30| And I'd like the Neighborhood Association to also be really open to some thinking and some changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3870)|
| 1:04:36| and I'd like maybe we could have this come back to us in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3876)|
| 1:04:42| Would that be a bad thing for you as a developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| Well, we've already had to tear down a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| We've already lost that rental income, and we're already put back off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| From when we spoke with them before, all they kept saying is it has to face the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| They weren't willing to talk about how this is difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| You know, could we work on some landscaping to make it not so obvious?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| We'd be glad to do that, but they kept saying it has to face the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| I didn't feel like they were willing to see our point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| I'm not in opposition to rental property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| That has really nothing to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| It's really the orientation of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| And if it won't accommodate because of the drainage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| if it won't accommodate a duplex, then maybe you'll only be able to build a single family house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| I mean, it's not – I'm not opposed to rental property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| I think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| But you may not have the right size lot for what you're wanting to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| And that's what I'm – I think you've got to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| I mean, there may be other properties in the neighborhood that don't face the street, and I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| But we're here to talk about these houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| and whether we're willing to put our stamp of approval on turning these houses perpendicular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| And I don't want to be opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| But I think what we're saying is if this goes down and the appeal is upheld,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3955)|
| 1:06:01| then I don't know where that leaves you as far as what your next step is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| Now, I guess that's what they're kind of questioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| and asking you to think about postponing it before you get yourself in further jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3966)|
| 1:06:12| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| Yeah, I agree with Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| There are other ways to build a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| You may have to redesign the duplex, but you can still get a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| But I don't think we need to redesign your project for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| But I think it's important that everybody has said the parties really need to get together seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| and see if they can't work it out because I think there are some solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| And can I offer an amended motion to postpone this thing for some time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=3998)|
| 1:06:44| It's a priority motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| You can make the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| Well, I would make the motion that we postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| It would probably have to be if the association needs to meet with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| I think they meet on August the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| We meet on August the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| That may be a little too close in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| So I would postpone it at least until August the 19th and perhaps longer if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4020)|
| 1:07:07| Mayor, perhaps we could ask the association if they could have a special meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| so that these parties could get together and see if they find any common ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| so that they can come back here and possibly have a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| I don't think anyone wants to hinder their desire to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| I think they want to keep it sort of in character with what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| And maybe there's compromises on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| I see Mr. Collins there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4049)|
| 1:07:30| Can you have your board meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| The board has never met with these people, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| It's only one individual, Mr. Wolfenbarger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| Is that Mr. Collins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| Sir, by council rules, I can't call on you, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| unless somebody from council asks to hear you speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| And right now they've asked Mr. Collins a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| So if you could just step aside for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| Ronnie Collins, 4606 Washington Park, 37917,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| President of the Allisville-Springhill Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| We'd be glad to meet with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| I can put enough people on from our board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| and this is what we've done a lot of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| not necessarily have to be at the whole meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| In 30 days I can put a meeting together with enough people to discuss this with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4094)|
| 1:08:22| So you wouldn't have to wait until August the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| You could have an interim meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| That would be a full-body meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| I can put enough people together, I mean the board enough together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| to actually have a discussion with them in the next week or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| Well, I guess the nice question is, Ms. Curry or Mr. Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| are you willing to do that to see if you can work that through or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4117)|
| 1:08:43| I mean, are you willing to have that meeting to see if you can work it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| We could do it in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| And I gather from Mr. Collins he's shaking his head, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| So that would be at our August 9th, I mean our July 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4138)|
| 1:09:04| Yeah, I'm making a motion to postpone this thing so the two parties can get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| and see if they can't come up with something that works for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| Second that emotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| Second that emotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| I heard that song somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| So we have a motion to postpone, motion and a second to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| We have a gentleman who's been standing up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| I'd like to go ahead and recognize him, hear what he has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| Sir, please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4173)|

| 1:09:39| It's about a block from Valley View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| And it's nice to see you in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| I've seen you on TV before, but I am a disabled veteran,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| and I have rented from Mr. and Mrs. Curry for approximately 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| and they are two of the most nicest Christian family people I've ever met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| I've also been a commercial plumber for the past 45 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| and the house that's just been tore down, we did have a little bit of water problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| I put in a sump pump, and it alleviated the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| And within the last three weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| they have installed a double-wide trailer home not facing the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4213)|
| 1:10:20| It's east of the swimming pool, east of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| It's not facing the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| That's all I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4228)|

| 1:10:32| Okay, so we have a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| Was that for 28 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| I think our next meeting is in 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| They're coming back in 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4242)|
| 1:10:43| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| July 9th and July 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4245)|

| 1:10:49| It doesn't matter to me the 9th or the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| I thought they'd agreed on the next meeting, our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4251)|
| 1:10:56| That would be July the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| They have to have time to meet first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| Let's let them talk about that and see what they can agree to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| Next two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| So on July the 9th, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| So postpone this for two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| Postpone this for, yeah, until July the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| That's enough time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| No, that's not our.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| Yeah, you've got the 4th of July and all in there as well to have to coordinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| Two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| Or July the 23rd then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| Okay, so we're going to postpone for until July 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| Is that appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| The 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| Okay, so that's the motion to postpone to July 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| Are you all ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4293)|

| 1:13:25| and these are the final adjustments before going into the construction phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4405)|
| 1:13:30| You've gotten through all the details and now you know where you are so you've got to bump the price to accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| And the big change on this particular change order is just that having gone through the whole design process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4415)|
| 1:13:43| we now know much better than we did when we started how long it's going to take to actually do the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4423)|
| 1:13:49| and the engineering inspection that goes on as construction goes on, which is required by TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4429)|
| 1:14:00| is very much dependent on the duration of the project and that's the big adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4440)|
| 1:14:06| It takes more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| It costs more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| That's what you're telling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4448)|
| 1:14:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| 11E is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an agreement with Vaughan and Milton Consulting Engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4459)|
| 1:14:25| for an amount not to exceed $74,170.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4465)|
| 1:14:31| Move to accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4471)|

| 1:14:39| 11F is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute any and all documents necessary to accept a grant of $98,480| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4479)|
| 1:14:47| from the Knoxville Regional Transportation Planning Organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| and authorizing a city match of $24,620 for the purpose of developing a bicycle facilities plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| and a downtown circulation and mobility plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| Councilman Della Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| This one and the next one, I guess, are sort of about the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| Maybe Jim could just tell us how does this fit in with the fact that we now have a bicycle engineer in-house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| and we're obviously, one, seeking the grant here and, two, in the next one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4512)|
| 1:15:17| talking about hiring an outside consulting firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| How does that work with your own internal design capability that you just put in the new budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4520)|
| 1:15:26| Well, we don't necessarily have any more design capability than we did before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4526)|
| 1:15:33| We do have a person to look after some of the recommendations that come out of this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4533)|
| 1:15:41| So you follow it closer in-house, but you don't actually do the design work itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| Well, we do some of the design work in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| This is the kind of larger scale plan that it's helpful to have somebody come in from the outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4548)|
| 1:15:56| who has some objectivity to make recommendations about direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4556)|
| 1:16:04| And it's also –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| They have some experience in this field, I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| Yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4568)|
| 1:16:09| And, of course, since it isn't the next fiscal year yet, we don't have the new person on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4569)|
| 1:16:15| We don't have a new staff person on board yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| Getting close, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| We're getting close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| But it's a different in kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| You're saying that's an engineer in-house who can shepherd this stuff through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| but you need an outside designer to bring a bigger perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| Yes, and also we need somebody from outside who can take the time to step back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4589)|
| 1:16:34| Staff's really tied down with their day-to-day jobs, and it's a really –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4594)|
| 1:16:42| we only have so much staff capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| Even with the new person, it would be really difficult to do this kind of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4609)|

| 1:17:05| and a downtown circulation and mobility plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4628)|

| 1:17:20| for the transfer of surplus city equipment for decommissioned Ford Crown Victoria full-size sedans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4640)|
| 1:17:26| for a total price of $16,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| Moved for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4650)|
| 1:17:31| Councilman Speier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| I just had a question, I guess, for Mr. Evans on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4653)|
| 1:17:43| I guess this just comes from someone who has a vehicle at 230,000 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| Some of these vehicles seem like the mileage is relatively low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| They're new, aren't they, to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| And so I guess I was just wondering the policy of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| how the decision is made to decommission a vehicle and, I guess, make it accessible for sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4679)|
| 1:18:06| and what that process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| And I know there's another, I guess, the next resolution is for non-MARC cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| and there's an optimal life cycle, and so I was just curious on how that process is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4694)|
| 1:18:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4702)|
| 1:18:23| Boyce Evans, purchasing agent for the city, 228 Bradencourt, Clinton, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4703)|
| 1:18:31| For every type of vehicle, we do have kind of a target years in service life cycle as well as mileage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4711)|
| 1:18:43| And that kind of gives us a baseline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| but we also look at some of the maintenance problems that we're having with them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4727)|
| 1:18:52| And essentially what we do is it's kind of hard to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4732)|
| 1:18:57| You come up with a system of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| Our mechanic, you know, the folks in fleet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| and I know whom we're doing it for like the police department we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| whoever their liaison is at the time that's working with us with fleet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4747)|
| 1:19:13| traditionally sit down and they'll work on the point system and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4753)|
| 1:19:19| These right here, yeah, the mileage is, yeah, it's not way up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4759)|
| 1:19:28| It has not exceeded 80,000 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| But for the Crown Vics, five years is what we look at to start to get rid of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4771)|
| 1:19:38| So these are ready to get cycled out actually because they've hit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4778)|
| 1:19:45| And then like on the next one that you'll get to in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| you'll see there's a spreadsheet in there that talks about kind of the life cycle and miles for SUVs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4788)|
| 1:19:54| as well as some of the sedans there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4794)|
| 1:20:00| But what you're saying, it's not just a magical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| it's not just when they hit either five years or 80,000 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| that the actual maintenance history of each vehicle is taken into account?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| That is correct, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| We pull that out of, we keep all that in a software called FleetWave, very extensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4810)|
| 1:20:17| We look at all that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| So, no, those are the parameters, those are the curbs on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| It really has to be something bad before we try to get rid of it earlier than five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4823)|
| 1:20:28| or earlier than those miles, you know, one or the other being met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| But, you know, when it hits that, we're also looking at the maintenance history of them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4838)|

| 1:21:12| for Morrow Technologies Corporation to provide digital signage for the Knoxville Convention Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| for an amount not to exceed $199,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4877)|
| 1:21:22| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4882)|
| 1:21:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| I just want to be sure that this particular sign is going to follow all the required ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4886)|
| 1:21:32| External signage, not external signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| Well, still, I want it to, you know, follow whatever we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| Would you like to chair a task force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| We'll add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| We'll add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| No, we won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| Councilman Dullavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| We have Ms. Bogart here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| I thought we'd have her tell us about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| As I understand the presentation and paperwork, at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| this is a way of staying competitive, but could you tell us about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| It absolutely is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4917)|
| 1:21:58| For the record, Mary Bogart, 2112 Chasley Boulevard, Maryville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4918)|
| 1:22:06| We really are in a market where, you know, we advertise and we have a beautiful convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| It has a beautiful art collection, and all around it, things are wonderful are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| And in order to stay compatible in our marketplace, this is what all of our competition is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4935)|
| 1:22:20| and already has done, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| What we're asking for is three components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| One is digital meeting room signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| There will be 22 signs that will go outside of the meeting rooms that will make it much easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4950)|
| 1:22:36| for a meeting planner to do business with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| Currently, if a meeting planner comes and wants to have breakouts, which is how they use the rooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| they have to have professional signage printed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| They either rent easels from us or they bring their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| And that signage has to be changed out throughout the course of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| The digital signage, the first time we even do a resume, that's the last time it has to be touched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4972)|
| 1:22:57| It's very, very turnkey for a meeting planner, and it's things that we're hearing our competition is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4977)|
| 1:23:03| and we're losing business for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| One less thing they have to do on site to make their meeting flow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| And from a building standpoint, it affords us the opportunity to advertise throughout the building on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4990)|
| 1:23:17| and or to allow someone like Bush Brothers or Clayton Holmes or a pilot or whomever is in the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=4997)|
| 1:23:23| to actually brand, if you will, while they're in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| So that's very attractive to meeting planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| It makes our facility turnkey, and it really freshens up and updates the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5008)|
| 1:23:33| The other component of that is, I don't know, if you really pay attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5013)|
| 1:23:37| I did bring pictures if you'd like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| I'll pass you that real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| We have really, really dated kiosks at all of our entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5022)|
| 1:23:48| They're literally not really what I would consider a kiosk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| It's a wooden structure on wheels that holds brochures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| and it has a little place for us to insert a directional sign directing someone to the ballroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| or directing someone where an event is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| Those also have to be printed out, changed, and manually changed out throughout the course of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5042)|
| 1:24:08| It's really unattractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5048)|
| 1:24:09| They're really looking worn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| So what this package will include are digital touchscreen wayfinding signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5052)|
| 1:24:19| And I'm also on the wayfinding committee with Ann Wallace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| so we'll be able to incorporate the wayfinding map and graphics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| that they're working on for the City of Knoxville's wayfinding program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| so that there is some continuity with the graphics and the look of the wayfinding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| That touchscreen kiosk, it takes you through the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5074)|
| 1:24:40| but also it can take you out of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| There will be maps that show you how to get to Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| You can pull up restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| You can pull up menus from restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| It has the capability of checking your flight if you're an attendee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| to see if your flight has been canceled or delayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| There's an app that you can download while you're right there next to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| and send the information from the building directly to your phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| so you can take it throughout the building with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| And this is what attendees are looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| attendees such as Scripps Networks that brings in talent from all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5106)|
| 1:25:09| These are the things that we're up against to keep the business that we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| Then the third component of it is to implement digital signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| in our two permanent concession stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| which right now we have the old Pepsi menu boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| that have the little letters that you have to manually change out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| So this will afford a new look for the concessions area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| without spending a lot of money on renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| Digital animated food and beverage graphics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| that will allow the chef the ability to change the menu on a whim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| if something didn't sell the day before and he needs to sell something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| he can change that quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| So all of these things and all of these components will really keep us cutting edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| Our competitors are already doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| And you have the tech people in-house to operate these and everything, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| Glenn Flatford, who is our manager of technology, is with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| Part of this included in this price is the software, the hardware, the training, the implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5162)|
| 1:26:08| And one of the reasons that we recommended Janus, they are the leader in the industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| is because of their support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| Clearly, if we're going to put this kind of investment in the center, we need to be able to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| They're tried and true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| And that price comes with an SMG discount, industry discount of 13%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| so it's a savings of $21,000 because we do business with them in other markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5185)|
| 1:26:30| Thank you so much for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5190)|
| 1:26:31| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| I'm sure Dwayne is going to ask you to pull the drapes if they flash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| No, I just wanted to say, Mary, I just wanted to give you a hard time about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5197)|
| 1:26:42| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| And I'll be over there to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| There is a 60-second static hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| Is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| Thank you, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5212)|
| 1:26:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5218)|
| 1:26:59| Councilman DelVopio, why don't you turn that off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5220)|
| 1:27:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5221)|

| 1:28:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5336)|
| 1:28:57| You had your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5337)|
| 1:28:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5339)|
| 1:29:00| How much during the year do we get in terms of grants for the police department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| A significant amount, as you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| They're on about every agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| That's why I was curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5348)|
| 1:29:09| I mean, they're doing a good job in terms of grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| They're doing an excellent job in pulling down funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| Would you have any idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| Not off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5358)|
| 1:29:19| I couldn't tell you a total amount per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| I see the money man in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5361)|
| 1:29:22| He might know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5362)|
| 1:29:23| Jim, do you have any idea how much in grant money Janet Gorman and her folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5363)|
| 1:29:28| I don't know if she has folks, I know Janet Gorman does quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5368)|
| 1:29:34| Jim York, finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| It's quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| That makes it official now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| It's probably in the $1 million to $2 million range would be my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5381)|
| 1:29:48| It's probably closer to the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| As you aggregate all the police grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| Really, just about every council meeting we have a grant that we're approving that KPD pulls down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5392)|
| 1:29:59| They do a wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| And the official amount is quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| Please send our regards to Janet Gorman and the rest of the staff at KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| Janet Gorman and Megan Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5411)|

| 1:30:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5417)|
| 1:30:18| Did we vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5418)|
| 1:30:19| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5419)|

| 1:30:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| Mr. Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| Can you tell us about this since we've almost completed the whole run, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| It's an exciting project, isn't it, Mr. Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5468)|
| 1:31:09| It is exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5469)|
| 1:31:10| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5470)|
| 1:31:11| The 500 block of North Gay Street is that block between Magnolia and 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| As you know, a couple of years ago we did the blocks south of there, which would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| been the Riga Square block, and north of there, which would have been Emory Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| So this now connects North Gay Street to downtown with the same type of streetscape improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| And really it takes us from Emory Place in the north all the way across the bridge to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| the south to the Baptist Hospital side of the bridges at Riverside as it may become.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5497)|
| 1:31:38| It's been a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| Councilman Del Verpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| Yes, as I understand, as long as you're at the mic there, we're going to have some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| the same lighting themes and stuff, so it will unify the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| As it turns out, we're going to have the same context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| The double acorn fixture will arise on one more Gay Street block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| We thought it was going to be the single acorn, but the pricing of doing the double| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| was probably better than doing the single because you didn't have to use as many poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| So you'll see the double acorn fixture that runs all the way now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| It will be from 5th Avenue all the way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| And much better, because of the space, we'll have much more detailed landscaping north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| of the bridge than we do south of the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| I think it's been very attractive and quite appealing to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| Oh, the lanes will be cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| Now you have basically six lanes of asphalt out there now for a road that has more bike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| on those cars, so we're definitely narrowing that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5553)|
| 1:32:34| Great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5555)|

| 1:33:24| Councilman Delvaux, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5604)|
| 1:33:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5605)|
| 1:33:26| Bob Wetzel, is this like what we did about two weeks ago where we bumped out that little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| section of Market Square to make sure that it was contained in a district that lawfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5609)|
| 1:33:35| can use the pilot approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| Slightly different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5618)|
| 1:33:39| That was the approach to use a TIF in a redevelopment district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5619)|
| 1:33:43| This one is a state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| If you use a pilot, you have to do it in your CBID or a designated Center City area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5625)|
| 1:33:50| They wanted to make sure it was incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| So we need to make sure in this resolution we say Cumberland is a Center City area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5632)|
| 1:33:56| We did this about two months ago on the hotel project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| We will include this when we bring back the Cumberland Avenue Redevelopment District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| We'll make sure that that clarification is in there so we don't have to do this at other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| times if we want to use this type of financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| You'll revise the whole map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| This just revises one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5651)|
| 1:34:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5652)|
| 1:34:13| But when you come back, you'll revise the whole map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5655)|
| 1:34:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5656)|
| 1:34:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5657)|

| 1:34:21| Bob, could you tell me briefly what is considered Center City?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5661)|
| 1:34:27| Well, for purposes of the Tennessee code number, number, number there, it's whatever you all designate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5667)|
| 1:34:33| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| We would think the Center City area is obviously where all of our redevelopment districts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| As a primary point, there's obviously downtown, downtown north, Magnolia Warehouse, South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5679)|
| 1:34:46| Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| Those would be Center City areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| I think you could easily say Five Points, Lonsdale, Mechanicsville, Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5689)|
| 1:34:55| Those are all Center City areas as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| Oh, it's whatever is determined by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| By the local legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5701)|

| 1:35:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| Is that what you're going to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5716)|

| 1:36:09| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| I guess, Jim, if you could come down here, you may be the one that has to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5771)|
| 1:36:17| Have we looked at unless Gary is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5777)|

| 1:36:21| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5781)|
| 1:36:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5782)|
| 1:36:23| Gary, would you come on down, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| Well, the question is a simple one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| Do we look and make sure that if cats having more workers' comp claims because, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5785)|
| 1:36:30| drivers get injured sitting in seats all day or something, will that affect our overall ratings so we might end up paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5790)|
| 1:36:36| more citywide if we take them under the umbrella?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| I understand this proposal is if we bring them in there's some savings right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| but is there a downside where we could bump ourselves into a different class by getting more industrial accidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5803)|
| 1:36:50| so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| Actually, I think the city's rating, because the city overall has more high-risk jobs, the cat's not likely to bring our rating up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5812)|
| 1:37:02| And the rating doesn't really have a lot of effect anyway because we have such a high retention level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5822)|
| 1:37:08| We pay the first, what, $2 million or what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5830)|
| 1:37:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| We have such a high retention level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5832)|
| 1:37:13| They're not really looking at rating so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| If we have a claim up around $1 million, then they're going to start looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5835)|
| 1:37:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| I was just concerned there might be unintended consequences, but you don't think that's really a driver to this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| No, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130625?start=5846)|
