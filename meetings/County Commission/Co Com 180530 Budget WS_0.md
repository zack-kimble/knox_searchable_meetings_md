| 0:01:10| Thank you, ma'am. I was requested to call this workshop meeting by several commissioners for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=70)|
| 0:01:16| the purpose of giving department heads and fee offices a chance to talk about the budget and for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=76)|
| 0:01:22| Interaction between the commissioners and the budget. I guess we'll start with if there is any department heads or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=82)|
| 0:01:29| Fee offices that wish to address us about the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=89)|
| 0:01:32| Please feel free to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=92)|
| 0:01:41| Okay, next if there's any commissioners that have any questions for any of the departments, please feel free to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=101)|
| 0:01:52| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=112)|
| 0:01:54| Go first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=114)|
| 0:01:57| Allison believe miss Allison. I call you Allison by chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=117)|
| 0:02:09| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=129)|
| 0:02:09| Requested hopefully that the sheriff would put in for a truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| And a litter crew. Do you know what that's was added into this budget? I see vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=133)|
| 0:02:19| Marked in and mark, you know it we did put it in our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| But after discussions with the finance director believe that was budgeted in solid waste in the solid waste budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=143)|
| 0:02:30| So solid waste to show one one request in one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=150)|
| 0:02:34| So a solid waste is going to work the sheriff's department to do this or there's no litter control from the inmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| So from the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| It was not budgeted in our in our budget for next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| But I did talk to Dwight van debate this morning about that and we are going to have a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=167)|
| 0:02:54| To see how we can work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| But he will not be able to use inmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| Inmates to do because they're they're not licensed or bonded or licensed to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| That's what we're going to have the meeting about to see if the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| Can help in and provide an officer or two officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| To take the people that are picking up the litter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| Use our officers to do that so we can use our inmates plus our officers. So we're looking at possibly shifting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=200)|
| 0:03:27| Those positions to the sheriff's office, but they have been budgeted but just in the solid waste department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=207)|
| 0:03:34| Is that part of the also the litter officer? Hopefully? Yes. Okay. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=214)|
| 0:03:40| That's something that I had spoken to a lot about is a solid waste here then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| Don't see Dwight. I don't know the guests Chris. Do you know if they're asking for a truck van or that just says vehicle? I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=227)|
| 0:03:56| Can follow up Dwight did mention to me that there would be a vehicle that he he could loan us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=236)|
| 0:04:04| Yeah, we've got I said we solid waste he's got three I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| 15 passenger van to the band in the truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| tempesture van in a truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| I'd just like to see that litter crew out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| talking with Dwight that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| Have these inmates out there cleaning up dumps, you know in the roads also as much as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=261)|
| 0:04:28| And we're seeing a through the court system. We're picking up a lot of litter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| from the probationers now, we're starting to see that funnel in but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| One solid waste gets a call say hey we got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| 100 tires dumped off somewhere or whatever. That was what I was hoping the sheriff's crew could do was take them and go get those tires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=281)|
| 0:04:49| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| Like I said this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| We discussed it and we're gonna set up a meeting with chief ruble and see what we can we can get worked out between the sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=292)|
| 0:04:59| Office and solid waste so we can have an officer that's certified out there with the inmate crew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=299)|
| 0:05:05| to pick up the litter and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| hopefully they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| Find litter and have a name on it. They could write a ticket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| And that's what we need. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| I'll go. Thank you very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| Mr. Chairman, I'll turn it over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| Commissioner right Thank You. Mr. Chair, and I would also like to then echo what Commissioner Daly has just spoken to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=322)|
| 0:05:29| I did not know he was involved in in this deep of being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=329)|
| 0:05:36| Ready to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| Litter pick up looked at am I being heard on this? Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=338)|
| 0:05:47| And years gone by I have seen inmate population used by civic groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=347)|
| 0:05:54| such things as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| Tree removal and and other helpful things to civic organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| And I do see the problem that that that Commissioner Daly is raising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| we have to have someone there that supervises crew, but in my observations the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| Sheriff's Department person there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| There just to watch after the people that are assigned the tasks not to work with them at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=380)|
| 0:06:28| Completing the tasks so I see it takes two people to supervise a group one from solid waste and one from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=388)|
| 0:06:36| Sheriff's Department and I fully support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| activities like this taking place and encourage as you're saying in upcoming meetings that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| That that we are able in Knox County to work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| To get solid waste picked up by people who are assigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=410)|
| 0:06:57| Short-term residents with Knox County. Thank you. Mr. Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| Commissioner Bussard. Thank you. Mr. Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| Allison, there's some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| There's some requests that I think that we need to take a look at and I put in front of each commissioner here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| of some things that the Sheriff's Department may need and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| One of them is some upgrades at the old jail and the training center and it has to do with fire protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=438)|
| 0:07:26| In these facilities and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| It's not a big outlay, but it's something I think that we may need to look at because of some of the things that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=449)|
| 0:07:39| I guess handle at that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| Can you tell me all the things that you handle at those two facilities that need upgrading in fire protection at those two facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=460)|
| 0:07:47| We house a lot of evidence for our narcotics unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| We also house our trainees that go through the Academy they're housed at one of those facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=471)|
| 0:07:59| It's used for a lot of property storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| And we do have offices at those two facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| would like the fire protective services to be upgraded and we just have the bare minimum right now and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| We feel like we do need those facilities upgraded that was not put in though our capital request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=494)|
| 0:08:21| That was at the request of the litigation tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| Money that we had spoke up and I have talked to Chris Caldwell and that money is being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=504)|
| 0:08:32| to offset school debt and also to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| Pay for the bailiffs in the courtrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| So that money is not available that we initially thought it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| Chris I want to ask a question it appears here that we get about two million dollars a year of this litigation tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=524)|
| 0:08:52| million goes to the schools and a million goes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| To offset the cost of bailiffs and courtroom security. It's in the budget. It's in the revenue line item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=535)|
| 0:09:02| It's been that way for 10 years. It's I know it's been that way for 10 years, but when the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=542)|
| 0:09:09| Bill came from the state to authorize this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| Looked like it was supposed to be for the city, you know that the county building it's here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| But we did put it in for school paying of school debt, and I'm not sure sure how we got to the point. Maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=560)|
| 0:09:30| I can say that we are adhering to what the ordinance says. So the ordinance which is in code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=570)|
| 0:09:37| I think it's 18-1 or 18-2 says $25 to courtroom security and $25 to pay down school debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=577)|
| 0:09:45| we have to adhere to what our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| Charter says and our charter says to distribute it that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| So we do distribute it that way and it's a they are budgeted funds that are collected by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| two courts criminal court and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| Civil court and we budget for that and that it helps offset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| Allison's budget on courtroom security and it helps it's a transfer to the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| And so that money is allocated and is accounted for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=607)|
| 0:10:14| Mr. Law director what I was asking about is it was done by the County Commission ordinance to split those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=614)|
| 0:10:22| and it looked like in the ordinance in and of itself was to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| Directly to the upgrades in the county building itself, and I know there's a there's a thing in there about paying off debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=627)|
| 0:10:37| But I didn't see anything mentioned about schools and there's a section that calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=637)|
| 0:10:43| Construction debt is the term they use and I would say ten years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| I wasn't here when they made the decision County Commission created that ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| And they interpreted that construction debt to be Knox County construction debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| And I would assume I'm just assuming because County Commission then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| Allocated the money the way the ordinance is stated and of course finances has to distribute the way the ordinance is stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=665)|
| 0:11:13| It's at this pleasure how those taxes are used at this Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| Mr. Law director after a 10-year period might that be considered maintenance of effort towards schools now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=678)|
| 0:11:29| It's a source of revenue, I don't know whether it would be maintenance of effort or not. It's an operational generally not capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=689)|
| 0:11:39| Maintenance of effort is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| Is there sir parents are planting clause for operations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| whereby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| If the state increases the county cannot decrease and the only way that your operational cost can be decreased as if enrollment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=708)|
| 0:11:56| Decreases I'd have to look at it specifically, but I'm not sure that capital falls under maintenance of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=716)|
| 0:12:11| To answer Commissioner Bailey's question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| Solid waste asked for a vehicle. It's just as like four-wheel drive trucks. I'm not sure what it's specified for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=736)|
| 0:12:23| We funded one vehicle. They they asked for one and we funded one and so and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| we had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| Request from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| solid waste in the sheriff department for new employees as it was related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| to litter we funded the ones in solid waste and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| Encourage them to work with the sheriff's department on how that would work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| We could not we did not we could not find the sources of revenue to fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| Every request as usual and so we chose to put those in solid waste and to let them work with the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=771)|
| 0:12:59| Administration once that begins and to figure out how that could work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| Since you let a cat out of a bag a little bit, you know, I hadn't spoken with Dwight we had some meetings and with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=785)|
| 0:13:12| Mr. Salter and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| He had since we lost one of our environmentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| That's what he wanted to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| He wanted to get a sheriff's department officer there that is bonded and licensed that can go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| And write tickets and arrest someone if it's necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| Also, I think Dwight talked to me about sharing that person. I know when codes goes out to to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=808)|
| 0:13:35| to a home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| That could be dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| And there's dangerous people out there and that officer can escort that codes office out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| And I believe the sheriff's department does that anyway on request but having that on-site sheriff's officer there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| I think it's a fantastic great idea. I was a behind it 100% and told Dwight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=829)|
| 0:13:55| I hope it goes that way and it looks like that's what happened and I am tickled to death that that's what you're what you're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=835)|
| 0:14:02| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| Mr. Schoenmacher Thank You. Mr. Chairman back to the litigation tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| It's my understanding that it's $50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| $25 is is earmarked for courtroom security and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| $25 for other last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| I had the opportunity to interact with several County Commissioners from across the state of Tennessee and I proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| posted or I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| Proposed this question to them and how they spend the additional $25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| No one said spent spends that additional $25 on school construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| In fact when I brought it up, they kind of they were like what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| in other words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| Is it possible that at the time the law director made a an opinion that this county has been following?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=884)|
| 0:14:52| But do we need to go back and actually see if we're following the state statute correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| I have to go about what the Charter says. And so the Charter says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| $25 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| To courtroom security and $25 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| School debt if if you want to revisit it, that's fine. But and until that happens we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=908)|
| 0:15:15| Just distribute it any other way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| Okay, so Commissioner Buster. How do you with your since this letter from the sheriff's department? How do you propose that this be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=917)|
| 0:15:24| Funded that well or this is probably not on this year's going to be on this year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| But I do propose that we do add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| This to I guess next budget cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| whoever's here is add that to the next budget cycle and see if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| Asked that this be put on for next year's budget cycle since it probably is not going to be on this year's budget cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| but we need to revisit the issue of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| past County Commission passing ordinances and how it respond Bruce is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=954)|
| 0:16:00| Interpreted as far as as paying a debt and and what really is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| About paying a debt. Is that not supposed to be specifically stated? It's going to this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| recurring debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| Instead of just generalities. Is that what it looked like to me the king from the state? It has to be specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=973)|
| 0:16:22| Targeted to certain debt and if it goes into the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| I don't think we're following state statute that gave us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| the ability to pass that litigation tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| and I think we need to revisit that and look that I guess with our if we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=995)|
| 0:16:41| Legislative body wants to take a look in dig into that thing that happened. I guess it was like what 10 or 11 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1001)|
| 0:16:48| These 10 or 11 years ago and see that we're following that statute like we're supposed to and that's my point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| So I ask that we look at this and make sure these things that right here we put on next year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1014)|
| 0:17:01| to protect those files and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| Then look into the litigation tax and to see if we're following state statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| I know we're following ordinance by charter and I'm not arguing that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| But it was done in a way that I don't think it should have been done in my opinion, but there again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1033)|
| 0:17:20| I'll have to get legal advice to make sure that my opinion is worth anything at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| Chris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| This is about a hundred twenty thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| Is this something we can look at after we close out books this year and see if we have any fun?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| To address these one-time needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| Yeah, we can look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| Allison's already got her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| List and it's growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| We can look and see what we're gonna close, you know, we don't know what we're gonna have to close out yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| But yeah, I mean we can add it to the list. I mean that list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| It's growing so I'm the back of my book. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| Yeah, we'll add it if we get there, but we can add it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1079)|
| 0:18:08| Michelle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| Well, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Have a couple of questions one was our expenditure on the summary by our employee benefits fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1092)|
| 0:18:22| It looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| our actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| 217| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| compared to our adopted 218 and 218 it went down quite a bit from 217 and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1108)|
| 0:18:35| I requested and proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| For 219 has come up quite a bit so I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1119)|
| 0:18:46| Why did it decrease in 218| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| And now we've gone back up it's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| 18 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| Okay, first that is a non-budgeted fund so you don't vote on that fund so that's first and foremost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| second is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| What you are seeing is our actuals for you talking about the self insurance fund fund 263, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1146)|
| 0:19:14| The actuals for 17 is twenty six point five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| We adopted a budget of thirty point two and eighteen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| We won't spend all that thirty point two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| So that will help to increase the reserve so we can try to keep premiums on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| Employees as flat as possible and not have ebbs and flows and premiums and so what we will do in these internal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1173)|
| 0:19:40| service funds since they are non-budgeted is we will always put a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| budget number in there that we feel is enough to where we don't have to come back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| Post anything else and so basically those funds are self-sufficient because it's transfers from other departments within the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| that makes up the revenue and the expenses hit as they hit you being on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| Insurance committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| We've done so far. So so well, we don't really well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1202)|
| 0:20:09| With health and health cost and so I don't anticipate us using the whole thirty point two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| That's what I was hoping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| Was why because our insurance committee has done such a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| it's staying on top of everything and then then I'm on page 13 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1223)|
| 0:20:30| This might be for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| Martha if you can and with the Health Department off, but our social services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| I was surprised how it dropped and then of course our disease and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| surveillance and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| investigation has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| Gone up quite a bit. So I was just curious about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| The social services and all I know she I know she'll have a good answer for it, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1257)|
| 0:21:08| So, hang on one second, let me get oriented to what you're asking me to report, okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| That is those are some positions of folks who left and we did not replace those positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1274)|
| 0:21:21| So that's that's what that is. That's through just do attrition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| on the part of the social social services, okay, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| The disease surveillance and investigation of how it actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| Went up by 30. Okay. I have it going down. So, um, can you tell me where you are? It's page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1296)|
| 0:21:43| 13 don't have the same copy you do page 13| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1303)|
| 0:21:56| Okay, so page 13, sorry, I'm just trying to get to the same page you're yeah, that's okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1316)|
| 0:22:06| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| And oh, I know that is a position that we added to help with overdose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1331)|
| 0:22:18| Response and overdose tracking so we added a position there and that went into these surveillance just took me a minute. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1338)|
| 0:22:26| So so it's it's really just has to do with the employment. Okay? Yes. Okay. All right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1346)|
| 0:22:34| Okay. Thank you. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| There was one on page eight with our central cafeteria the schools and all that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1360)|
| 0:22:48| Went down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| And let's see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| And I was just wondering how the cafeteria changed so much if we are maybe outsourcing more that's saving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1372)|
| 0:22:59| less money or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| You know how how it went down so much from 217 to 218| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| We get that number straight from schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| I think we're going to answer that question and so that is a number that is derived from their department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1390)|
| 0:23:20| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| I'm sorry, Commissioner. Could you pose that question for me one more time, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| It's on page 8 and it's general cafeteria. It's also you can also pick it back up on page 9| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1410)|
| 0:23:39| There was you know, it goes all the way back from 214 and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1419)|
| 0:23:46| from 216 to 17| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| And then 217 218, but then we drop quite a bit in 218 and 219| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1429)|
| 0:23:56| So I was just wondering what changed with our cafeterias with our schools. Well, what's gonna be less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| For this next year it goes to the community eligibility provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| we've got eight schools that we're projecting will no longer qualify for the community eligibility provision and that will cause us to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1446)|
| 0:24:15| reduction in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| Refunds from the federal government. So that's what we're projecting our reduction will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1458)|
| 0:24:28| So eight schools will come off of that yes, ma'am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1468)|
| 0:24:35| Okay, well that's I mean now I knew there had to be a reason why but that we would see a difference in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1475)|
| 0:24:43| So, is that something you're surprised by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| No, these these were schools that were pretty close on the bubble when they went into the community eligibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1486)|
| 0:24:53| Provision and as their enrollments have changed and as as the requirements for the program have changed these these have fallen off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1493)|
| 0:25:00| And I don't remember them all off the top of my head, but you know, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1500)|
| 0:25:07| Immediately comes to mind I think Gap Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| Which is a small school Bearden Middle School, which has its own dynamic would no longer be, you know part of that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1509)|
| 0:25:16| so it's a variety of reasons for each of the eight schools a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| Question that I get asked quite a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| It's like how many of our schools and how many students average in Knox County that are on free or reduced lunch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1522)|
| 0:25:30| and I know that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| Getting bigger. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| Can I don't have those numbers off the top of my head I can tell you for direct certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| And what direct certification means those are students who are receiving some sort of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1541)|
| 0:25:48| Through some other entity they get directly certified for free free meals and we're running around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| 17,000 on that number right now and then the reduced price would be above that but I don't have that number on top of my head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1555)|
| 0:26:05| Thank you, okay, thank you ma'am. Hey Russ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| While you're there, I want to thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| Superintendent Bob. I see John back there Doug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| Joe in the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| For meeting with me one-on-one. I know that you offer that to every commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| I think I was the only one that took it. I know we did as a finance committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| We did a meeting but I found it to be a very in-depth and frank conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| That was very helpful, and I really appreciate you all taking the time to do that. Thank you commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1591)|
| 0:26:40| Commissioner national| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| Thank You. Mr. Chairman Chris, this is going to be kind of a random question, but I was recently appointed to the agriculture committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1602)|
| 0:26:49| By this Commission, and I'm very grateful for that appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| one thing if you look on page 12 that I noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| You know the top line as we look at our partnership with the extension agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| Which I know is our state is a land-grant state University of Tennessee is the land-grant institution is is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| Required to help provide extension services to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| The increase was about 10% there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| And I was just curious if if that was mandated by our charter or with the state or if there was a particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1636)|
| 0:27:23| Additional request they had for additional headcount or anything related to that. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| They made a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| Like they are treated like of the department, so they made a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| And I don't believe it was a I don't believe it involved adding a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1653)|
| 0:27:43| And as I said this is one of those I didn't expect you to have that one top of your mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| So if you need to get back to me on that one, that's fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1666)|
| 0:27:58| That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1678)|
| 0:28:06| Is an increase in salaries and benefits we don't pay their salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| So we don't show it as a as a headcount, and so that's what that is and so we we pay them quarterly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1689)|
| 0:28:15| I believe a certain amount that goes to their budget at UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| Be clear it's probably passed through to the extension program to provide the service to the community correct. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1699)|
| 0:28:28| Commissioners come back Thank You. Mr. Chairman. This question is for the Election Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1708)|
| 0:28:40| Yes, sir, yeah, I noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| That in our major equipment plan that your department is planning on updating and the outdated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1723)|
| 0:28:50| Voting machines. Do you want to just give us a quick update and do you have enough funds to get the equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| I will have you all give me my two and a half million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| So let's just start with that. That's I've dealt with some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| Potential vendors because we don't know who we're going to have our contract with until we issue the RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| So I've been working with mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| Caldwell and we've come up with a number of two and a half million to put in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| Capital plan keep in mind that that will not cover the the full cost we get ten thousand dollars per precinct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1755)|
| 0:29:22| from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| Using the hob up funds help America vote act funds that are there. So that will be another eight hundred and ninety thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1764)|
| 0:29:32| That's sitting there at the state now that we will use to supplement it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| And you use that word outdated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| Which is okay, I suppose but keep in mind the system that we've been using for 12 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| We're going to be using for August and we're going to be using for November and make no mistake about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| There is nothing wrong with those machines. We have never lost a vote with those machines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| I keep finding myself having to reassure the public and the media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1800)|
| 0:30:06| about this because of what happened on May the 1st, which had nothing to do with the election equipment, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1806)|
| 0:30:13| Where we are now is where I said we would be in March of 2016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1813)|
| 0:30:19| after we had the Republican| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| Presidential preference primary where you all remember those of you that voted in the Republican primary spinning the dial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1821)|
| 0:30:28| Forever and we knew that that's not an efficient system for that type of election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| I have been told by the Republican Party because I raised my hand and protested and say hey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| Why don't we do it like the Democrats and that's not how they want to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| They want to vote for all the delegates and that's their right to do it. Okay, but we know that system doesn't work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| It works great if you're voting for one person in one race| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| So we knew then that by the time we got to March of 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| We had to have a new system in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| The state will tell you and it's wise way to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| You don't get a new system in an even year election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| You want to ease that new system in in the odd number election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| So the goal has always been to have a new system in place early next year for use in those City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| Elections so that when we get to March 2020, we'll be good to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1875)|
| 0:31:21| Countywide now the machines we're looking at our touchscreen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| It's what everybody tries to do on this old equipment anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| They try to punch the up there at the top and nothing happens. That's what we're looking at now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1888)|
| 0:31:36| the system we're looking at would not have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| voter verified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| You know paper audit trail, but whatever we get would be able to have that device hooked up to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| So that if either the state legislature or the federal government and their infinite wisdom decide that's what we're to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1907)|
| 0:31:55| Then we will add those on at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| Hoping that if the state orders it or the federal government orders it that they will give us money to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| So we don't have to take it out of the Knox County budget, but I'm not volunteering for that assignment yet because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| Basically three and a half million dollars is a hunk of change for a new system and we hope that whatever we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| Will last us another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| 15 plus years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| That's what we hope so that's kind of a long answer maybe to your inquiry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| But I just wanted to be sure to kind of touch on some other issues that may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| Lurking out there. Well, and and I hope you didn't misunderstand me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| But I I did not have a problem with our existing machines and the way business was done in the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| No, and I know you and I've had conversations but people out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| I seem to just can't wait to misinterpret something about the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| But I find myself on the defensive all the time and not with you because you and I've had several conversations about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| But people out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| Have the wrong impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| I had handwritten postcards delivered to all the commissioners yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| Wanting to know what the Election Commission is going to do about that the security of the voting equipment because of what they've been reading in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| The paper which again has nothing to do with the voting equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| Well, and and the other reason too, I mean equipment only lasts so long. That's right of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| It's it's we've done really well with what we have. Do you suppose there's any salvage value to the old equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=1998)|
| 0:33:26| Well, I do know this that when we bought we had to buy extra equipment a couple hundred thousand dollars worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2006)|
| 0:33:33| To get ready for November 2016. I didn't have enough machines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| So we bought that from the current vendor heart and they've made it clear that if we go with their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2017)|
| 0:33:44| new system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| that we would get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| rebate back on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| Now I don't have that arrangement with anybody else and how that's going to pan out in the context of the RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| I don't know but beyond that it really doesn't have much value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| Because they knew we had to supplement what we had to get through that election and that we were going to get a new system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| in 20 into 2018 or early 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| Okay, and if I could just take two more minutes, can you just give us a quick update on the progress at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| Downtown West facilities yet where we are is that the facility won't be ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| to to move into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| until July the 20th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| unfortunately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Early voting starts not my favorite date, but Friday, July the 13th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| So we're going to be in the old spot where we were which is fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| We're going to make a little more room for it. And then we'll be ready to go when it really really matters will be in October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2079)|
| 0:34:46| So and I was afraid of that the whole process just took a lot longer than I thought right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2086)|
| 0:34:52| Well, we won't be we won't be voting there in August. Okay, we'll we'll be it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| They're giving us the free spot again where we were before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| But we won't have the new spot that we'll be paying it's going to take a while to get it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| You've got to get it ADA compliant among other things and there's a lot of work to be done there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| But when we do early voting for the November election in October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| We will be good because the space we've got now will not be sufficient with the numbers of people we anticipate to be voting there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2113)|
| 0:35:21| Early in in October. Okay. Well, thank you. I appreciate it. I appreciate you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2121)|
| 0:35:35| Thank you, mr. Chair just follow-up cliff and me or mr. Rogers, I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| How many machines there are we looking at just for my yeah just generally we're looking in the neighborhood of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2140)|
| 0:35:47| 700 machines now some of that number will be what we call the disability access units those that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2147)|
| 0:35:53| Cost a little more because they're for people with disabilities whether they need to have the headphones on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2153)|

| 0:39:47| Target we've also heard about recovery high schools or recovery schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| And I was wondering are you making any plans in the future in your budgets to take care of those things are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2391)|
| 0:40:00| We know how much is that going to cost us down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| We're in the early discussion phase right now with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2404)|

| 0:40:30| putting together a task force of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| Folks to take a look at recovery high schools to make it put a working plan in place to determine a cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| In a location and that sort of thing so it's in the really early stages at this point for the recovery high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2439)|
| 0:40:46| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| another issue that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| Know you all took a beating when you were doing your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| And you were cutting certain projects and things of that sort to meet I guess the MOU that we've got with each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2453)|
| 0:41:00| And I got a letter from my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| Representative miss bounds talking about you know this extra funding. We're giving. What is the school's position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2463)|
| 0:41:10| I know miss bounds told me she said I can't believe that you all would go over and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| Find those things that the mayor's asked for she was kind of upset. What's your feeling about that well that certainly will be the board's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2475)|
| 0:41:24| Position they would vote on that my recommendation though to the board was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| Present a budget that was within the revenues as they were projected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| in compliance with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| Memorandum of understanding that's what the board ultimately approved then there was conversation about some additional funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| I think that the mayor made in his budget presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| And my understanding was there was supposed to be some type of of an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| developed I guess to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| To sort of outline what what was being presented. I've not seen any agreement at this point, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2513)|
| 0:42:00| again the position that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| that I took was to to present a budget that was within the revenues and followed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2522)|
| 0:42:09| Current memorandum of understanding it was approved by this body in the school board and that cut one of them had to do with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2529)|
| 0:42:15| Great schools partnership. I understand that was one of the cuts that caused such a public outcry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| Oh, that was those project grad project grad and how much is that to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2541)|
| 0:42:28| In your budget, I think right now. What did what we say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| Well current year that we're finished up as a million 41,000 for next year. What's in the board approved budget is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2551)|
| 0:42:38| 500,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| Talks about the primary government and it talks about great schools partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| It said there was a 2.5. There's over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| 2.5 million dollars plus some change there and my oh, I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| In the K for us last year in June 30th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| 2017 it gives a thing in here about great schools partnership on page 51 in this book and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2581)|
| 0:43:08| It talks about the two over 2.5 million and then it says down in here revenues and other sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2588)|
| 0:43:16| Expenses and revenue services. It says great schools partnership project and it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2596)|
| 0:43:24| 325,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| $574 is that the revenue we receive from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2607)|
| 0:43:33| What I think that's probably a Chris question this okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2613)|
| 0:43:39| That is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| reimbursement for the transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| Of the community schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| And so that's they are a component unit of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| So that's why it's in the CAFR that way and so as a component unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| We have to show them as a transfer any time. They make a payment to schools. We make a payment to them. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| It's a transaction of component units and we do the same thing with it with the development corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| E 9-1-1 is a component unit the schools is a component unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| And so all that is that's just a piece of what they do and it's a piece of a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2651)|
| 0:44:18| That they have funded for the schools that that represents transportation cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| Well, here's my question to you. I just need to make sure I'm understanding this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| Aside from project grad the great schools partnership budget is 2.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| Little bit more than that. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| Yeah, that's just the piece that we get that's not a total but I got that's what we give that's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| That's what my basic question is. The county gives the great schools partnership, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| A little more than two and a half million dollars. Yep. Okay, that's what I try to make sure I understand. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2685)|
| 0:44:53| And the piece that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| The connection best was on is just a piece of what they do that shows up in our annual state and in our annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| Financial statements they have their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| Financial statements that you could look at that shows their whole their whole system of what they do their revenues and their expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2704)|
| 0:45:14| Commissioners gunmaker. Oh, thank you. This question was for the property assessor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| How are you, sir? Good good. Hey for the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2718)|
| 0:45:26| For the next three years the county's gonna spend 2.3 million dollars on software upgrades for your department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2726)|
| 0:45:34| The first year after July 1 what will that actually be used for that half a million dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| Well, it's going to be used for a lot of things. It's going to be used for a lot of other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| After July 1 what will that actually be used for that half a million dollars? Is that for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2744)|
| 0:45:54| I don't know what the name of it is. I just am looking at the 2.3 million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| And can you pull your microphone a little closer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| Yeah, it's it's the system we use for appraisal, but we won't be using it until we'll implement it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2760)|
| 0:46:07| You know take two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| Okay, you're just stockpiling the money until you can actually buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| It's for IES world which is they're going to be their software that they use which will connect to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| The Tyler software for the trustee which connects the Tyler to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2787)|
| 0:46:27| and what you've got to do is the contract to set up you have a 20% up front and then they got to start the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| process of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| Building that system up and getting it ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| okay, so what you have there is the initial cost and we'll have cost of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| Consultants and things of that nature and so it's not stockpiling of money. We can't do that. We've well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| I mean I understand that that was not an appropriate term. So basically it'll be in service then in 2021| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2807)|
| 0:46:55| They have to have it down by 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| 22 for reappraisal and so we've got to get this process started just to get it done. I understand. I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| I just wanted to know how the process works. Thank you. That's great. Can both you guys stay there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| Since you're up here John, I want to ask a question Chris you also it's a two-part question and it deals with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2829)|
| 0:47:16| reassessments and setting our new tax rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| It seems since I've been on Commission. I've noticed that whenever we do a reassessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| We set our tax rates that one and I don't know this first part of the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| What we do about the payment in lieu of taxes from utilities how we stop that reduction from happening and that may be a state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2850)|
| 0:47:37| legislative issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| But there's a second part of this question too. And and John you do a great job. I'm not it's the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2860)|
| 0:47:46| I think that's a little bit messed up. It's where we send out our reassessments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| We come and set our tax rates and we still have appeals out there that lower that base that we're setting that tax rate off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2871)|
| 0:47:58| and it seems to be that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| more and more people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| Appealing and applying to the state for reductions and we come out a little bit on the low side of being actually neutral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2883)|
| 0:48:11| Is there anything we can do to try to correct that in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| They can the formula said by the state, okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| There's I think you can actually estimate certain things in that formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| And if you're if you estimate too high, then you have to give money back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| So there's I think there is some adjustment that you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| But you got to be careful because if you collect more then you got to get back if you collect less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| You know, I don't know if they make that up or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| I kind of doubt that but you can't estimate it to some degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| Is there a component that we get to put in an estimate for what we think will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| reappraised and down valued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| yeah, you can't you can't estimate that but that's a that's kind of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| That's that's hard to do. Okay, because these three appraisal is kind of unique and it depends on when the market how the mark is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2939)|
| 0:49:09| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| And and if you go up 10% you may have you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| 2,600 people or a taxpayer of the bill if you go up 25% you may have 3,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2954)|
| 0:49:21| Appeal so you don't you're you found this make the number of people gonna appeal then the number of people is going on with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2961)|
| 0:49:27| State so there's all kinds of when you estimating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| There's all kinds of things you got to consider this year when we set the tax rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| We're two years beyond or we're a year beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| The reappraisal process, right, right, so we should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| There should be a lot less fluctuation in the base than there was right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| We've started taking phone calls for the appeals right now. They're very slow. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| They'll pick up as we go on but right now they're very slow we think it'd be a fraction of what it last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| Okay. Thank you. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| So after the state OTAs from a year ago that led to a million dollars decrease and how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3006)|
| 0:50:12| Do that we decided as the finance department to track OTA separately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| We want to pull them out of our current collections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| And so this is the first year of doing that and through April those that total of OTAs is a hundred thirty seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3019)|
| 0:50:26| Thousand that's across all funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| And so by doing that we that shows you that amount is a lot less than what it was the previous year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| But we will start to budget OTAs like the budget pilots and TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| So we'll have a contra revenue there to offset that we just want some history behind it before we do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| But I think what happens I think John spoke to this. It's really it's the state's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3043)|
| 0:50:49| Schedule that throws everything off and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| You know the some of the state OTAs that got approved and reduced were rejected through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3052)|
| 0:50:58| Through through Knox County. And so how do you stop that? You probably can't stop it. But I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3058)|
| 0:51:05| Anyway, the state would adjust the timing of their process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| That's that's what hurts but I I think the key to that as well is that every county could be on a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3069)|
| 0:51:16| Reappraisal cycle and so it's not always going to be the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| But they could try to adjust their timing to where it could help us as we try to budget for each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3078)|
| 0:51:24| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| Mr. Wright, mr. Chairman, I must excuse myself. I have a dental appointment. I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3086)|
| 0:51:37| Mr. Daly, thank you, mr. Chairman. This is for parks and rec. Mr. Vitale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3097)|
| 0:51:45| You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3105)|
| 0:51:57| Doug I have never asked you how you pronounce your last name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| Battelle just like a tail. Yes, sir. I've heard of a telly and Mattel. So I'm what's gonna call you done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3120)|
| 0:52:08| Under your parks and recs on page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| 30 I guess 38. It's hard to tell you have got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| Tractor with a side boom mower. Where is this good? Is this gonna be used all over all parks or yes, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| That would be used all over the park system for trimming greenways and driveway entrances that sort of thing. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3142)|
| 0:52:30| Noticed I know that we need it badly. You know, I see King Park is for one example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| So I'm glad to see that that's and I've mentioned to mr. Vanderbeek that I see sitting back there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3156)|
| 0:52:43| One of the things that citizens notice more than anything is roads being cut in the summertime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3163)|
| 0:52:50| And soon as that roads cut they notice it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| But when that Johnson grass grows back they get complaints about why ain't the county more and more and more but we understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| So I'm glad to see that that's and I've mentioned to mr. Vanderbeek that I see sitting back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| That's $60,000 what is can you tell me where that's going or that is gonna focus on three parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3183)|
| 0:53:10| I'm John Tarleton Tommy Schumpert and the sports park primarily as well as a couple of our maintenance yards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| Just with the incidents of vandalism and issues during games. It'll give us eyes on those parks to watch over vandalism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3196)|
| 0:53:24| And I'm glad to see that that's and I'm glad to see that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| With the incidents of vandalism and issues during games. It'll give us eyes on those parks to watch over vandalism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3206)|
| 0:53:33| Concession stands that get broken into as well as like say when you have an incident during a game situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| We'll have video surveillance of it then which we hope is a good turn deterrent to to stop some of those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3219)|
| 0:53:45| So that's going to be three parts. Yes system is for that. That's what we're targeting for this first round. Yes, sir three parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| You and I have had discussions on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Contracted mowing services. Yes, sir. You know, I think they need to step up or we need to take another look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3235)|
| 0:54:01| Think about a contractor. They don't take the care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| that say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| an associate of knox county would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| so I think that we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| Really step it up on that on the mowing part where we got. I don't know if other districts we can't talk to each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3252)|
| 0:54:18| so I apologize for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| saying this but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| I think we need to we need to call their hands and make them step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| And if that if that's communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| That's part of it, but once that communication part's done they need to do what they said they're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| Yeah, and as you recall, we terminated one contract exactly. They couldn't step up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| The one that we talked, you know for bowerfield, I think he stepped up. Yeah, and you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| That might be the lack of communication on our on the part, but uh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| I just wanted you to know that sir. Thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3291)|
| 0:54:57| You got a question for doug, mr. Carringer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| Go ahead. I got a question for that. Is that uh on page 12 where we see park maintenance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| We have a six percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| from this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| on that is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| Is that because of the cameras or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| Is that a more mowing contract or operational budget is more contract mowing? Yes, ma'am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| As commissioner daily mentioned we're doing more contract mowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| So one of the things we do is the park system has grown has moved more of those parks to contract mow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| We're over 30 of the 42 parks. We operate under contract mowing now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| So what we're doing is as opposed to adding more full-time staff to do those jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| We're going to contract mow and using our existing staff to really follow up behind the contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| Again, as commissioner daily mentioned to watch over them and to do the repairs and maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| They don't do they pretty much go in and mow and trim and that's all they don't pick up limbs. They don't you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3352)|
| 0:55:58| Fix a picnic shelter a restroom that sort of things or moving our staff into those kind of positions and contracting out the mowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| Which again is a cost savings and it's a good efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| It's uh, it has its challenges too just watching over the contractors, but that's that's the biggest increases in the contract budget there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3367)|
| 0:56:14| Commissioner thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| Did you have a question for doug? Is it no different? Okay. Well, I don't have one for doug either. I'm finished with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3376)|
| 0:56:23| Thanks, doug for everything you do. Hey chris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| Going back to you know, I think i've often felt like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| One of the biggest uh cock guns we carry around is the um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3391)|
| 0:56:37| Being self-insured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| Being self-insured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| And the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| And and you know, we talked back in 16. I think that you know, we all these new drugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3402)|
| 0:56:48| That were coming out. They were very expensive that were great drugs doing a lot of great things and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3408)|
| 0:56:54| looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| this proposed budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| Is not an increase of any significance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| are we seeing a leveling out of the cost of some of those drugs or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| What's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| future hold for being self-insured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| For covering people with the health insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| Since mark jones isn't here i'm gonna throw him under the bus, but actually I won't i'm telling you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| He's really a good job. Let me give you a reason why most employers now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3439)|
| 0:57:25| If they have 50 employees or more go self-insured, okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| So the industry is going away from being fully insured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| um, we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| cover ourselves from big claims because we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| Reinsurance, I think is kind of the word of anything over 400| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| excess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| Anything over 400 000, I think's the number we use now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3464)|
| 0:57:49| We get covered. So any any expense over that we get reimbursed. We've done a really good job of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3469)|
| 0:57:56| doing a prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| approvals on certain specialty drugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| medical claims and regular prescription claims are down now self| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3481)|
| 0:58:08| Specialty claims are up but not a great deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| So specialty drugs that you have to watch because that's what happens that people will see it on tv| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| They go to their doctor and they want it right away and don't do the stair-step approach of other things that may work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| And so we do a lot of what we call pa's on a lot of specialty drugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| So they just don't go out and buy them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| And so I think we've actually done a really good job of building up our our fund balance in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3508)|
| 0:58:35| health insurance fund which is self-insured and so that allows us to keep premiums kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| Of level and not have a lot of peaks and valleys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| And so, um, I think that fund the last two two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| We've not had to subsidize it which is the first time that we've got to that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| So, um, I think it's actually going really well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| So that 400 000 I know randy's in that department or chairman smith is in that department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| So anything over 400 000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| That we hit with one individual one individual then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| Our our backup insurance picks it up. Yeah, and and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| Add on to what chris is saying. There's an employee in the benefits department. I call her name is chris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| Yeah, she did a really good job. It's krista and she's came in and did a really good job of analyzing our our policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3556)|
| 0:59:22| And our benefits and finding things that could be tweaked and also done a really good job of staying on top of these, uh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3562)|
| 0:59:29| these specialty drugs and these drugs putting in place tier systems where you can't just go out and start using this drug without being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3569)|
| 0:59:36| Proven that it's the only one that'll work for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| Yeah, I would say if you if you put a monetary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| Value on what she saved the county if you could it'd be a million bucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| I mean, it's because those prior approvals on specialty drugs can save you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| a ton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| She's constantly looking at it. So maybe those savings are actually what we're seeing and and not such great increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| It does i'll tell you this because our employer increase on health insurance in this budget is one and a half percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3598)|
| 1:00:05| Which is half of what we normally do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| So so by doing things like that, it helps not only to keep the employer side low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| But you won't see big increases on the employee side either now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| what you might see is a an increase in the future because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| they've come in and kind of carved and and and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| and tighten things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| But there is always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| medical inflation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| Yeah, you know they say that the rate of medical inflation is 10 annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| Last year, we actually saw a decrease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| Quite amazing on our plan. Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| Okay. Thanks chris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| Yes, I guess for andrew chris today what is the we're self-insured to how many millions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3643)|
| 1:00:50| Exactly when does that kick in do we do we hit that and we ever hit that limit on what on the self-insured?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3650)|
| 1:00:57| So we're self-insured on on workers comp general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| Ability and health insurance and so they're all three separate three separate plans. We use third party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3661)|
| 1:01:07| Administrators to do each and what we do. No, i'm, sorry. Go ahead not workers comp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3667)|
| 1:01:13| No workers, and we have a tpa on that. We don't use it ourselves. That's evan. That's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| i'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| On on the medical it's 400 000 per individual if your expenses get up to 400 000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3679)|
| 1:01:26| The excess policy kicks in on workers comp. It's 750 for everyone, but our officers they're at 1.25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3686)|
| 1:01:33| Well, the reason I asked the company that I retired from we were self-insured like 35 million dollars our company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3693)|
| 1:01:40| Paid up to 35 million dollars then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| After that 35 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| The policy kicked in. Yeah, so this is kind of different from water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| Yes, it sounds like it is. Yes errors on the health on the health sides into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| Visually based and we pay for that excess coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| I don't know what it is and what we end up doing is carving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| some of the employees out here on a lot of specialty drugs because they want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| Increase your premium if you keep those on and we do a lot of analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| Chris does a lot of analysis determine what's the best options for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| Do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| I'll say this too while we're on this topic. Evan hauser has done an amazing job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3732)|
| 1:02:17| Saved the school's a lot of money on workers comp. We actually got to reduce their premium this year by 500 000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3737)|
| 1:02:25| And in this budget which helped to offset some of their increased expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| And so he's done a really good job of saving the school's money on workers comp saving the county's money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| The county money on workers comp so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| He's saving about a half a million a year on the county side since he took over from that. So what two years he's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| Doing that actually he's been here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| Three three three years. Uh, he came in initially just to do the county side so we could do away with the tpa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3764)|
| 1:02:51| I i've never liked tpas. You don't ever let somebody else be in charge of paying your bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3771)|
| 1:02:56| When he took over it, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| But if i'm correct, he's been saving us about a half million dollars just on the county side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| That was just in the actual cost the administrative cost went down over a hundred thousand dollars a year when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3784)|
| 1:03:11| created that department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| Believe it or not. Evan helped create the department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| Basically as a favor to me. He was a outside attorney with tpa type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| business, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| When we got together to say this is something we wanted to look at I called him on the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| He we had lunch next thing. I know he applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| The people that evaluated him didn't know one thing or the other but he graded out tremendously and has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3814)|
| 1:03:40| A tremendous savings to knox county. I mean he is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| I mean you look at he's half a million dollars a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| He's been here three years a hundred thousand dollars administrative cost just to the county side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| Not counting what he's done with bob's people since and now we have the teachers under workers comps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3830)|
| 1:03:56| They weren't even there and still saving money. So that's I think he's done a tremendous job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| He's real asset to the law director's office. He's real asset to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| To knox county. That's all I was thinking. He's actually with the law department, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| It's interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| He works for bud but his salary is paid for through the internal service fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| So it's not even a budgeted fund. So he pays for himself about what he does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| And our liabilities went down as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| And there's another component to that not only saving money providing coverage to more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3862)|
| 1:04:28| But doing it in a better service friendly manner, I bet you too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3868)|
| 1:04:36| Uh, just a quick question, um roughly how many employees reach that 400 000 cap, uh on a budget year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3876)|
| 1:04:44| probably well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| We get a we get a report on the insurance committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| Quarterly or by annually on that. I think it's like less than probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3889)|
| 1:04:54| I want to say for sure less than 10, maybe less than that. It's not it's not a huge number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3894)|
| 1:05:02| It's been at 400 000 for a long time if a lot of people were hitting it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| I'm sure we would have due to premiums had to have increased it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3905)|
| 1:05:12| Go ahead. Oh, thank you. Uh, this question is for engineering and public works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3912)|
| 1:05:24| Management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| While we're on the theme, let me also um echo that evan hauser has settled a case for us. It was very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3926)|
| 1:05:32| Um did it effortlessly and finally got to the point where the employee was attempting to sue us was essentially fired by his own lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3932)|
| 1:05:39| So it does good work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| Hey, and I don't know if jim snowden contacted you by text where but I did not see you in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3941)|
| 1:05:47| You were kind of hiding in the background back there. So I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| But anyways, i'm glad you're here. My question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| Mr. Snowden had done a safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| inspection of a section on north shore drive of about 1400 feet long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3958)|
| 1:06:04| between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| concord road and the bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| Next to turkey creek on the south side of the road where there's no shoulder. There was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3968)|
| 1:06:14| suggestion to do a pipe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| And then fill it in with soil on top of that. So people when they go off the road there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| They don't automatically correct and then come back in across the opposite lane of traffic, which has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3982)|
| 1:06:30| exciting for a few folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| It's a hundred and forty two thousand dollar expenditure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| And I know this was a last minute item so it wasn't included in your budget for next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| Do you think that at the end of this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| Uh, you'll have any savings because I know chad road has been a very expensive project for knox county and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4004)|
| 1:06:51| Dedicated additional dollars to that. Do you see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4011)|
| 1:06:54| 142 dollars anywhere's in your budget where we could get a safety issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4014)|
| 1:07:00| Handled or could we also partner with the state of tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| For some of their safety dollars that they have available. Oh, i'm pretty confident that we can find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4025)|
| 1:07:12| funds for that commissioner, we've got a couple accounts one is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| You'll recall in the capital plan. You'll always see tdot partnership account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| So that those funds are not necessarily at the start of any given fiscal year allocated to a particular project because the state will come along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4040)|
| 1:07:27| and they'll want to expedite the signalization of a of a state intersection, um, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4047)|
| 1:07:33| Add right-of-way or otherwise ask us to participate in a project that benefits to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| So we've got a little bit of room to work there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| We may have some funds that close out though. Chris tells me close out is tighter than usual this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| May also have a little bit of money or a little bit of room to work in geometric improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| So, um, I would think so i've heard bits and pieces of the discussion with. Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| jim and chris severe, but uh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| Beyond that I don't have any particulars, but I would think we'd be able to find those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| Okay, and it's my understanding it would be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| In house the construction. Yes, that would be a savings. Okay. Is there anything that we need to do from our end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| No, sir, I think we're we're good. We have another, uh, actually on north shore drive that involves, um an existing subdivision where turning radius| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4090)|

| 1:08:26| Okay. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4106)|

| 1:09:12| dewitt and uh engineering and public works and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| Staffed. I don't know how many people exactly but he can probably speak to that better than I but there are employees there and basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4157)|
| 1:09:25| Uh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| Thanks, mr. Daly fire prevention is one of our departments it's one of the functional areas that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| Regulates the construction trades and does existing building inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| We are required by state law to inspect certain assembly use facilities every year and the fire marshal is over that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4178)|
| 1:09:43| schools hospitals churches daycares| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| and then when time allows we do inspection of existing businesses, especially high-risk businesses such as industrial parks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4186)|
| 1:09:55| Areas of that nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| We also do new construction inspection for commercial construction. We do not do new construction inspection for residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4196)|
| 1:10:03| That's largely handled by code administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| but any new commercial building or any major remodel commercial project in knox county is inspected for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4206)|
| 1:10:13| International fire code life safety code and nfpa compliance by the fire marshal or a member of her staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| I I didn't catch the specific question, but if that's you explain it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| Yes, is this a uh, is those inspections a fee fee service that knox county charges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4223)|
| 1:10:30| Yes, sir. When you when you get your building permit if there is a fire inspection, it's incorporated there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4230)|
| 1:10:36| So is there enough inspections that the offset the fees offset the cost of the inspections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4236)|
| 1:10:43| I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| It's different. I'm uh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| Mr. Hammond always turns in excess monies or the fee, you know, we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4247)|
| 1:10:53| Last year year before last we moved up the inspection fee to try the offset for the the codes department was balanced and even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4253)|
| 1:11:01| Yes, sir, we did what uh, we did maybe a little bit longer than that we adjusted to the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4261)|
| 1:11:10| Building valuation data that's published by the icc| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| Just a little bit more background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| Randy lily will be coming to you along with kathy saunders your fire marshal later this year to update to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4275)|
| 1:11:22| 2012 international code council's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| standard specifications for building and construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| And that is that's the international fire code the international residential code the international commercial code the international property maintenance code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4288)|
| 1:11:35| And quite frankly a bunch of other codes. I can't remember because we don't deal with them very often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| But it is the body of standards that we have and that we observe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| In that body of standards there are building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| Valuation tables that are geographically based that talk about the cost of construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| So when an applicant comes in their permit application fee is based on the square footage type of construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4311)|
| 1:11:58| And it's plugged into that building valuation data table and that generates the permit fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4318)|
| 1:12:04| We were not at the point up until commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| Um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| Authorized the the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| Updating of the permit fee structure. We were not at that point. We were having to receive a subsidy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| Still a work in progress. I think if construction trades stay as busy as they are and when we adjust for the 2018 I codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4336)|
| 1:12:24| We might be getting close to a break-even point, but time will tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| I wouldn't want to speculate on the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| I'll break on your coach department. They they do a good job every time i've called and talked to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4350)|

| 1:13:16| arm or whatever on the atv| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| We're getting fantastic. We're growing great and I am so tickled that we're starting to grow we're getting the firehouse subs the great clips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4399)|

| 1:13:35| With that comes problems and that's fire protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4415)|

| 1:13:39| you know, i've already talked to the mayor and talked to chris about it that uh, you know, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4419)|
| 1:13:46| At these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4426)|

| 1:13:54| These other counties says don't get in the ambulance business and don't get in the fire business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| But you know growing in the ninth district. We've got to look at something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| somehow and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| I just wanted to know see what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| So yes, sir. Thank you. Just a couple initiatives if I could mr. Chairman just to mention i'd like to brag on fire prevention a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4447)|
| 1:14:14| We are not in the fire suppression business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| We are in the fire prevention business and that's why it's called the fire prevention bureau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| But in order to do what we need to do effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| We have to work closely with all of the fire agencies both the volunteer agency in in your area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| the rescue squad the city and rural metro and karn's fire department and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| Last year the fire marshal initiated quarterly meetings. We do them over lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4475)|
| 1:14:41| Where all of the fire officials come together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| From kfd chief sharp has attended from the rescue squad chief witted has attended from rural metro chief harness attends chief longer his designee attends from karn's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4484)|

| 1:15:00| But but that chief attends as well along with travis evans. Who's our senior inspector and plans review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| Professional and kathy saunders. Who's the fire marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| A lot of good production out of those discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| Um, and they brought us a lot of value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| We also partnered with and and some of you will remember approving this memorandum of understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| We actually had two investigators who worked closely with the investigative unit at the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4520)|
| 1:15:26| Who were county employees were fire prevention employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| We found that that placed some limits on the training that they were able to obtain. So we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4530)|
| 1:15:36| Executed a memorandum of understanding and commission approved it which made them sheriff's office employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| They still work out of this building. They still work out of the fire prevention bureau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| But they're actually on the payroll of the sheriff's office the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| Supervisors and and maintains their credentialing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| We fund them through our office and provide equipment and they're able to do investigative work that they otherwise wouldn't be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4553)|
| 1:15:59| And that's been a very effective partnership for us as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4559)|
| 1:16:05| I just quick for you. Dwight. Um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| Um on the time at fire prevention bureau, uh, how often do they inspect all multi-unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4568)|
| 1:16:16| Housing in the county ever so often or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| As far as making sure that fire extinguishers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| Codes are up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4586)|
| 1:16:27| Do they do that every five years or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| They do there is a framework at state law that provides certain facilities again assemblies that have to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4591)|
| 1:16:38| Then on apartments they do it on a discretionary basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| It's not necessarily required by law for an existing apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| But they they have metrics of measurement they use where they look at fire events. They also look at construction type because older| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4604)|
| 1:16:52| 70s era apartments with frame construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| no firewalls or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| Firewalls of lesser quality than you would see in new construction today create conditions of greater risk and they do a good job of evaluating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4618)|
| 1:17:06| um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4626)|
| 1:17:07| Where their areas of greatest risk are and going there first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| So they I can't tell you they do them on a periodic basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| But I can tell you they do them on a systematic basis based on on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| How much uh staff time they have sure so they they were given an additional inspector last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| Uh, we hope in the future that we can add one more inspector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| and then we'll get into the industrial parks and the apartments with a greater frequency than we're doing right now, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| We're we're holding our own pretty well. Thank you. And and that meeting he he talked about with all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| People concerning fire in the county if you want to attend i've been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| So those meetings and it's it's good to attend and meet all those people and hear what they talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| Commissioner nyster, thank you. Mr. Chairman. I've got one question for the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4671)|
| 1:18:01| Page 15, please in the budget document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4681)|
| 1:18:07| Uh, just something that as we were looking at these sheets, I found kind of interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| Uh, if you look at the second line down our commissary at the jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4691)|

| 1:18:24| Maybe what was uh driving that that growth in that particular expense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4704)|
| 1:18:29| Um, actually as i'm sure you know the jail commissary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| It makes its own money. Uh, we fund the salaries benefits all the operations through the sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4712)|
| 1:18:39| Of the commissary items to inmates so we are making money. I mean we're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| Probably about 120 000 a month in the commissary right now. So that's that's the growth that you're seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4724)|
| 1:18:52| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| As I I think I get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| So it's one of those you have to spend a little bit of money to make some money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| So when you're yes seeing this growth, that's a little bit of investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| But there's a return on that because we're seeing a growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| That that's why it was a little confusing to me to be quite honest was our that didn't quite make sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| Because I knew y'all were self-funding in that we are we make about well last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| I think we made about a million two in the commissary and our expenses which includes salaries and benefits totaled a little over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4752)|
| 1:19:18| 900 000 so we had almost a three hundred thousand dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4758)|
| 1:19:23| Excess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4764)|
| 1:19:25| Okay, so this was just maybe for a little extra labor cost to sell more items or maybe more items more items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4765)|
| 1:19:32| So this is basically your your your cost of goods sold your inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| You spent a little bit more money on the inventory and then in terms sold it which helped y'all cover the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4775)|
| 1:19:40| Thank you, we buy more we sell more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| Commissioner gill, thank you. Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| ask chris caldwell to just give an overview of what our debt and our debt service look like and if he could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4789)|
| 1:19:55| Just walk us through that for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| the sake of getting some general information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4797)|
| 1:20:10| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| Uh, thank you commissioner actually if you turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| What what's the best page we need I would go to page 52 the last page in the book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| And what we talk about here is bonded indebtedness. So it's the issue of bonds to cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4824)|
| 1:20:32| um capital projects and needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| On page 52 it breaks it down between knox county knox county schools in a total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| Let's go on to the last column| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| You can see we always show a beginning year of 2011, which is the first year that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4846)|
| 1:20:51| mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4851)|
| 1:20:52| Burchett took office and you'll see a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| 691 691 million, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| You go down and you'll see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| um our last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| Audited fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| Which was fy17 we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| Had bonded indebtedness paid down to a little under 662.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4868)|
| 1:21:14| As we close out fy18, we believe that number will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| 656| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| 465 so little under a little over 600| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| And 56 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| With the approval of the capital plan in front of you it would pay down to an additional 9.1 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4887)|
| 1:21:32| So that number to end fy19 would be a little over 647| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4892)|
| 1:21:38| a million, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| Basically what we're doing is we're hanging down bonded indebtedness about paying more on principle than we issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4900)|
| 1:21:49| In bonds and so you can see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| On page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| You do the page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| If you go to page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| 44| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| The bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| Part of this schedule talks about the expected effect on bonded debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4921)|
| 1:22:06| And you can see there our plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| print our planned principal payments on bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| Compared to what we're going to issue for bonds for that current fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| And you'll see that in the fy19 the first year this five-year capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4935)|
| 1:22:20| Would this is the 35 million we just did no 38 38 that you approved yesterday was for fy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4940)|
| 1:22:27| 17| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| I mean fy18 fy18, which is the current year that we're in so we're issuing those bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4949)|
| 1:22:35| so next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| Fiscal year the bonds that you will issue will be that 35.4. They probably show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4956)|
| 1:22:42| The resolution will probably show 36. We always put a little buffer in there, but we only issue the amount in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4962)|
| 1:22:48| It's just how we do our resume our resolutions as it relates to bonds. And so you can see there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4968)|
| 1:22:54| That's how we paid down our bonded indebtedness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| We actually have tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| a ratings call with with moody's and s&p as it relates to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| bonds you approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| yesterday to where they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| come and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| reaffirm our bond ratings or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| You know change it or whatever they see fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| And so we do that tomorrow and it takes us a week week and a half to get back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| what that what those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| Ratings are and then we'll issue those bonds in june| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| at that point and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| We've basically paid down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| The the bonded indebtedness since the this mayor's been in office by about 43 to 45 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5016)|
| 1:23:44| All while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| doing continually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| projects for engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| doing schools things like that and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| Um, we know basically what our ratings agencies are going to say they say basically the same things every time we do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5034)|
| 1:24:01| and those things are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| They really like our healthy fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| They'll say we have an above average debt burden, which we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| and so we continue to to work on those things and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5050)|
| 1:24:15| You know, we got a double a plus bond rating by s&p a double a one by moody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5055)|
| 1:24:21| Um, the next high shooting gets triple a and so, um, you know, so we're right there we um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5061)|
| 1:24:29| we always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5069)|
| 1:24:30| Have really good numbers from an economic impact standpoint. So every time we talk to our rating agencies and they're always in new york| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5070)|
| 1:24:37| They're always impressed by all the investment going on in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| and um, that's positive and so that enables us to keep our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| Our bond rating we you know, i've heard before that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| That our our debt's too high and our debt is this, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| if it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| Truly as bad as some say we wouldn't be getting the bond ratings that we get. Okay, we don't they don't hand those out like lollipops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5098)|
| 1:25:05| um, and so we have to answer for those things and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| But that's how we do the bonds and in that bond in those bonds just so you know in the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5109)|
| 1:25:14| I just gave you the six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| What we're going to be down to the six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| Go to the end of 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| 656| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| And that number is also 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| Million dollars of bonds that were issued for our train project which pays for itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| So that contract is set up to where the energy savings pays for itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| So those bonds will be paid for by the energy savings and so no taxpayer dollars are used to pay for that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5135)|
| 1:25:42| And so but we issued bonds in that case for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5142)|
| 1:25:46| And normally we'll do we'll do a lease a capital lease on most things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| But that was when we did we did a refunding is why that one's that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5149)|
| 1:25:54| Chris a previous administration had I believe built some a school with some interest-only bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5154)|
| 1:26:02| Correct I don't know what you're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| What are those due to kick in and does the new regulations on what I call reissuance of bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5167)|
| 1:26:12| will that prevent us from doing any kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| Rebonding to reissue you can't do advanced refundings anymore. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5175)|
| 1:26:20| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| the new tax law that was passed by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| the president and congress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| Prevents advanced refundings when uh mark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5187)|
| 1:26:32| Mampoff is coming to speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| you all at your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| Lunch and ask him and he'll go over how that works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| He was he went to dc try to get him to change it because it has a negative impact on us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5200)|
| 1:26:45| Okay, so the savings that we have been able to save in the past from advanced refundings go away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5205)|
| 1:26:51| and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| um that won't be able to be achieved you can do current refunding, but just on advanced refunding which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5212)|
| 1:26:59| limits that that number extremely so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| Bonds you are talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5225)|
| 1:27:06| basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| It was issued I think in 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| Maybe 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| 28 year bonds. Um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| the first principal payment will be made in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| June on june the 1st of 2027. Okay, and then we will pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| The all of the principal all 69 million through the 1st of june 2034. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5246)|
| 1:27:34| um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| We pay a we'll have we'll pay bi-annually and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5255)|
| 1:27:39| They do come due and so um, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5259)|
| 1:27:44| That's how those bonds were structured and uh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| Right now what we can do about it. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| We make the interest payments every year. I I can tell you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5270)|
| 1:27:54| uh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| We made an interest payment probably this friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| for 1.7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| million on those bonds, okay, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| Uh, we achieve what we try to do is achieve level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5286)|
| 1:28:11| Bond payments. We don't like peaks and values. We like to be pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| level, I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| We've done a good job to that number creeps down a little bit as we pay down debt and that's helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5296)|
| 1:28:22| um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| And so people can say okay chris, but your debt service number is going up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| Okay, we are always going to budget variable rate debt higher than we have to pay and this is what we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5307)|
| 1:28:33| and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5313)|
| 1:28:34| um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| Once these bonds become payable by that time if we stick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| To the script so to speak as what we've been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| When those bonds become payable in 2027| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| Where we have the ability to pay and we're not going to we're not running up on a wall and can't pay it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5327)|
| 1:28:52| I'm going to have to issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| Whatever that's not going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| What we can't have is a spike in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| Um, we can't have a spike in our capital plan without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5343)|
| 1:29:09| Um revenue sources to to go with it because if you do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| Then you can't get to a point to where you pay here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| And so if we continue to do what we have done, which is issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| bonds in the amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| 28 to 35 million every year, I think will be okay and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5364)|
| 1:29:29| Um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| it's those bonds haven't before, um, i'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| I am where I am now and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| um, you know, there's others in here that you could look at and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| You know, you could say what were you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| I mean, we've been always asked about ed shops always likes to ask about air synthetic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| interest rate bonds and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| They are what they are. Okay, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| The state doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| Allow those anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| We did them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| Previous administration they don't affect us currently because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| Um, they only affect you if the interest rate's high. So when where we are now doesn't have impact of what we pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5404)|
| 1:30:10| It does show a negative impact in your in your financial statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| So if you look that will show as a negative that would be a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5413)|
| 1:30:17| To where when interest rates rise you can swap those and get to fixed rate and be fine until that happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5417)|
| 1:30:23| If you try to get out of them now, you're going to pay more than and they really don't hurt you as long as you just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5423)|
| 1:30:28| pay them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| and so it's just it was a it was a vehicle set up for payment and we we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5429)|
| 1:30:35| We traditionally like just vanilla fixed rate bonds. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| That's what we have issued since i've been the director and that's what I would always prefer to issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5440)|
| 1:30:47| And I think it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| Important point to go back on the one bond that no employee of your department was around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5449)|
| 1:30:56| When that bond was issued, I think we were around I was here. Uh, you were probably an intern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5456)|
| 1:31:02| Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5462)|
| 1:31:03| Yes, but I mean no in senior position because they probably would have sounded the alarm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5463)|
| 1:31:09| Correct. And so I think pretty much the norm in that era of financing. Yeah, I think at that point, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5469)|
| 1:31:15| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| senior director of finance said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| here's what we're going to do and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| Here's what we did 2027 is a long time off. Yeah to make the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| payment and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| And so, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| That's you know, that's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| But we do have some exposure with it with a trend of upward moving interest rates with these synthetics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5493)|
| 1:31:39| It's interesting you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5499)|
| 1:31:40| With the synthetics I went and looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| uh yesterday just to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| how a 20-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| Bond that we would issue how the interest rate has done since january| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| Where he wanted now to see okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| Because we didn't go to market until june. What's what's the change and what's amazing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5517)|
| 1:32:03| That amount's not changed that much on on a 20-year bond and it's been up but it's coming back down a little bit now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5523)|
| 1:32:09| Different of course in your everyday interest rate. So it's just it's been the two to ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| Correct. Yeah, and so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| We probably have lucky and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| missed anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| there was a period in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| March or april where it was a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| Elevated but it's came back down now. And so we'll issue those bonds and they'll be fixed rate bonds and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5547)|
| 1:32:33| we do not do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| Bonds like the 28-year bond. So what you would see if you looked at our bonds is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5557)|
| 1:32:42| Um principal paid every time that we make a payment that it may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| Not be level all the way across but it's structured in a way to where our total debt service will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5568)|
| 1:32:55| Level when you sit in your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5575)|
| 1:33:00| Can I ask another department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5582)|
| 1:33:03| Can we just go back? Oh, thank you. Mr. Chairman. Uh, this uh question is for the medical examiner's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5583)|
| 1:33:11| Please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5591)|
| 1:33:22| Good afternoon commissioner. Hey, john. How are you? Fine, sir. Um, I have two questions one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5602)|
| 1:33:28| We spoke about two years ago about the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| That you were trying to initiate with the other counties where we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5612)|
| 1:33:36| Autopsies for them that instead of charging an individual fee that they could go to maybe a flat fee for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5616)|
| 1:33:44| X number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| Autopsies, so your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| Revenue collections could be a little bit easier. Has that progressed any further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5627)|
| 1:33:53| We have talked to several of the surrounding counties severe county blunt county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5633)|
| 1:33:59| and a couple of others and looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| Essentially going in and providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| medical examiner services for those counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| In order to create a fixed rate or a flat rate for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5648)|
| 1:34:15| Part of what we have to look at when we go into those counties is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| We have certain standards that we have to maintain according to name or the national association of medical examiners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5659)|
| 1:34:27| and within those standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| Part of what we would do if we went in and set a flat fee with them is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5669)|
| 1:34:35| Dr. Maloosnik would become the medical examiner for that county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| And so as we've looked at costing that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5683)|
| 1:34:44| um, that also means that they would have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5684)|
| 1:34:48| medical death investigators at a certain level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5688)|
| 1:34:53| And as we've talked to the counties most counties are not wanting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| Go to that type of model because of of the cost associated with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| We do have that type of model with anderson county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| We have set our fee appropriately with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| When I first came in to the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| They were paying a hundred thousand dollars for that that service in looking at it. Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5715)|
| 1:35:23| We we had to up that rate to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| 275 thousand dollars and then now it's at three hundred and eighty five thousand dollars a year for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5726)|
| 1:35:32| But for that flat rate, we are their medical examiner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5732)|
| 1:35:36| We also do medical death investigation for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| and then we we've averaged out what we believe their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5739)|
| 1:35:44| autopsies would be for the year and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| If it's above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| It's on us a little bit if it's below then then we're good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| Uh, and our rate has been where it needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| Those numbers are based upon national averages and also the yearly averages of what we've seen within those counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5756)|
| 1:36:03| um, and i'll add that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| We have set our autopsy rate at essentially what it takes to cover our cost to conduct those autopsies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5766)|
| 1:36:14| We are not having a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| Collecting from any of the counties for the services that we provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| So that's not been an issue for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| Okay, good. And then the increase in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| Budget expenditures for this next year. Is that to some extent for the number of overdose cases that you're dealing with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5787)|
| 1:36:35| part of the increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| for expenditures in our budget is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| the expected increase in the number of cases overall that we will do as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5800)|
| 1:36:46| the number of of all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| Drug related cases that we will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| We have looked at our toxicology vendor and we've worked with them to manage down some of those costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5811)|
| 1:36:58| Um, but yes, uh, the increases for that, but we also have a about a two hundred thousand dollar increase in revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5818)|
| 1:37:05| which would account for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5825)|
| 1:37:06| Uh the additional autopsies that we would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| Okay. Thank you. John. Yes, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5830)|

| 1:37:14| Thank you, this question is for um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| Chris caldwell, um, I'd like to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| The impact of the hall income tax on knox county and if you could just briefly touch upon that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5840)|
| 1:37:28| Hall income tax, um that is budgeted in our general fund. Um, the state of course is phasing out the hall income tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5848)|
| 1:37:36| uh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5856)|
| 1:37:37| part of the um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| Um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| Increase in the gas tax, uh, the improve act. I think that's what it was called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| uh, actually in sped up the phase out of the hall tax and so what we have done this year in the uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5866)|
| 1:37:53| in the um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| general fund we have reduced our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| Our our budget amount of hall income tax down from 1.6 million down to a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5878)|
| 1:38:03| So to answer your question is the impact of six hundred thousand in current year 19 now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5883)|
| 1:38:09| Uh just to give you an idea of how hall tax kind of works we just met with our consultant who looks at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5889)|
| 1:38:17| all of our hall tax and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| He's sent to the city of knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5902)|
| 1:38:26| 2 000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5906)|
| 1:38:27| entries that look to be wrong that should have been credited to knox county that got credited to the city of knoxville and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5907)|
| 1:38:34| Uh, we believe that we'll have a correction in this current year for probably about a million dollars which will increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5914)|
| 1:38:40| um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5920)|
| 1:38:41| The hall tax current year question is what is your current number going to be and we'll get that july| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5921)|
| 1:38:48| But from a budgetary standpoint, we continue to phase that out because we know ultimately it will not happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5928)|
| 1:38:54| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5934)|
| 1:38:59| Mr. Dan, thank you. Mr. Chairman allison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5939)|
| 1:39:04| I got as good time to ask this question as any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| Can you give us if you've got the numbers fine? If you don't that's fine. Also, okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| The uh, I hate to use this word tablet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| Can you give us an update on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| The prisoners tablets, you know, is it is it funding itself how many is there or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5959)|
| 1:39:25| You if you know, that's fine. If you don't I don't have an exact number on how many tablets that we currently have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5965)|
| 1:39:31| Um, they're still sending tablets in as we speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5975)|
| 1:39:36| We don't have the max number that we would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| I think it was 900 if i'm not if i'm correct. Yeah, and we don't have those 900 yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5979)|
| 1:39:45| They're sending them as they can get them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| Yeah, I don't have the exact figure on how many tablets we do have but I can't get that for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5989)|
| 1:39:54| I know that's that's a money maker, you know, and i'll use that word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5994)|
| 1:39:59| And we ought to be making some money off of off the crime that's being committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| So if you would get that number i'd like to see what that what that would be, okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| If I remember that correctly, I think it was up to 900. They were going to phase them in as the man called for. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6007)|
| 1:40:14| 900| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| I know in the last probably a couple months. We've received another 40 40 to 50 probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6016)|
| 1:40:21| Um, but we're still not close to the 900 tablets that we are going to need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6021)|
| 1:40:27| But i'll get you an exact figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6027)|
| 1:40:39| Commissioners have anything else they want to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| Anybody yeah, does any other department want to address us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6042)|
| 1:40:46| may have come in late or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| I don't think they want to talk to us particularly procurement. They're back in the back hiding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6048)|
| 1:40:57| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6057)|
| 1:41:03| Guess we would yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6063)|
| 1:41:13| Hello, my name is steve carr and i'm just a citizen here interested in the process and i'm kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6073)|
| 1:41:19| Impressed with what's going on, but I did have a few questions that weren't addressed today. I was wondering if I could ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6079)|
| 1:41:24| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| Number one, I haven't heard anything about where we are on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6086)|
| 1:41:31| year-to-date income and revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| actual income and revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| Versus projections and budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| Are we close are we above are we below are we going to have any surprises? We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6100)|
| 1:41:45| Over 10 months into the year. Um, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6105)|
| 1:41:50| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| Chris gave us our last report our last financial, uh revenues chris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6112)|
| 1:42:03| And are we reading from page 19 if you're on top, you know, this is revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6123)|
| 1:42:10| So, um see I will tell you that we publish online also, uh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6130)|
| 1:42:14| a monthly financial update as well as a budget report to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| The citizens that we that we publish that you can go look at which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6138)|
| 1:42:23| If you're bored and want nighttime reading, it's really good. Um, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| From a yeah from an expense standpoint. We're right on track to work to where we thought we would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| Uh from a revenue standpoint, we're probably a little ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| So so do you think we will hit proposed budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| Yeah, I would anticipate that what we would have is what I would refer to as a budget surplus to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6161)|
| 1:42:47| Revenue exceeds expenditures and we get there from by a couple of reasons one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6167)|
| 1:42:52| Is we always will budget a hundred percent of expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| but we know that historically our department spend about 98 percent of those expenditures because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6177)|
| 1:43:02| We put in some some internal controls to say you can't do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| a requisition after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| April that way you don't try to spend everything at the end because you have leftover money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| so by doing that we've we help to control spending and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6192)|
| 1:43:17| We historically have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| Revenues exceed budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| and usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| In either a little bit in property tax, uh, we won't we won't see that this year, but we historically have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6207)|
| 1:43:34| Uh sales tax we will this year and we'll see it I think in hauling income tax this year because of the correction from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6214)|
| 1:43:43| Well, maybe while you're here I have two other quick questions the um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| actuarial estimates for retirement fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| Is that fully funded or are we behind on that? So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| For us we get a an arc| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| That we're supposed to fund every year when the state requires that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| Fund it a hundred percent. And so we got that arc funding for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6240)|
| 1:44:06| um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| Uop for the closed county db and for the school's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| Closed db plan and we will fully fund those, uh, those amounts actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6254)|
| 1:44:29| While he looks for that you want to go ahead and ask your third question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| Yeah, um, it's chris I want to talk about the future projections that the bond funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6273)|
| 1:44:39| How realistic they are with the borrowing needs it looks like the borrowing estimates are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6279)|
| 1:44:44| A bit less than what is actually taking place over the prior five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6284)|
| 1:44:48| I just wondered how much confidence he has in the fact that I think you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6288)|
| 1:44:53| 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| 28 to 32. Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6295)|
| 1:45:00| Yeah, 28 to 35 when the expenditures have been a lot higher how much confidence do you have and you folks too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6300)|
| 1:45:07| That we can keep those expenditures within I mean historically it's low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6307)|
| 1:45:12| Which would mean that these paydowns wouldn't be as great. So I just wonder how comfortable you feel with these projections. Let's go to the vows first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6312)|
| 1:45:19| uh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| uh, the uh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| the vow on um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| The county retirement plan for fy18 would be a little over 3.1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6324)|
| 1:45:30| Million, which is in this budget and fully funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6330)|
| 1:45:34| Uh, the old county teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6334)|
| 1:45:38| db plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6338)|
| 1:45:39| Is 475 000. It's in this i'm fully funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6339)|
| 1:45:45| The uop val is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6345)|
| 1:45:48| 5.6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6348)|
| 1:45:49| Million in this plan fully funded and then our disability plan is a little over 503| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6349)|
| 1:45:57| Thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| And once again, it's in it's it's in the budget. And so we fund those at a at a hundred percent every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6358)|
| 1:46:04| and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| Those are in there. It's good. It's a good good question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6366)|
| 1:46:11| And I don't know if you're interested in funding ratios or not, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| The funding ratios on those plans on the county db plan. It's about 64| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6376)|
| 1:46:20| Percent on the teacher's plan. It's 86 percent and on uop. It's 98| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6380)|
| 1:46:30| It's funded assets compared to liability and so what that means is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6390)|
| 1:46:39| There's about 36 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| That our our liability is 36 percent higher than our market value of assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6401)|
| 1:46:48| It seems like that would be a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| not a concern because the plan is closed and so since the plan is closed as long as we make our arc payments and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6411)|
| 1:46:58| Get a rate of return that we expect and eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6418)|
| 1:47:02| That margin will close. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6422)|
| 1:47:06| We looked at what it would do if we increased our payments to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6426)|
| 1:47:11| That closed db plan over time and we really don't see a benefit to closing it to making additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6431)|
| 1:47:21| Payments because the ending doesn't get shorter and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6441)|
| 1:47:25| You're looking at page 52| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| the one thing that's probably in here that may throw you a little bit is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6448)|
| 1:47:33| the 66 million here which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6453)|
| 1:47:38| Leads to the 94 over here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6458)|
| 1:47:41| Well, let me see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6461)|
| 1:47:46| Yes, and so that one's going to be it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| That was a relatively high one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| Which won't be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6473)|
| 1:47:54| In the future and one of those is also a an advanced refunding as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6474)|
| 1:47:58| So we got to probably do the last advanced refunding in the state. So it shows on here kind of twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6478)|
| 1:48:04| and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6484)|
| 1:48:05| Historically, let's see here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| If you look at those we're in the high 30s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| These are significantly lower than that. I just wonder if that's realistic or if that's a little pie in the sky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6490)|
| 1:48:15| I want you folks to understand that too if it's optimistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| Just do you think it's optimistic based on what we've spent the last five years? Sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| So I think what we have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| Great great question. I think it's realistic probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| more so on the county side the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6510)|
| 1:48:34| Because of time constraints just turned in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| Um a two-year capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| So we just put in for the final three years 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| million in each one they'll probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| Probably ask for around 12 to be my guess. I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| I mean they could ask for a new school and could bump that number up but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6529)|
| 1:48:53| I think what the superintendent would tell you as well is they've got some constraints by the service payments, too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6533)|
| 1:48:59| that will not allow them to do certain things and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6539)|
| 1:49:03| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| That number is probably should should be somewhere between 30 and 35| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6548)|
| 1:49:09| Chris so historically that would be what we would say that in the last five six years in our capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| We've all we've funded two schools and the largest road project in knox county history. That's true. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6553)|
| 1:49:19| um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6559)|
| 1:49:20| But we've been at 35| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| 39 102 which is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| Incorrect or high the 102 would probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6566)|
| 1:49:30| So historically it's not it doesn't reflect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6570)|
| 1:49:33| You know what the projections are so I understand i've just asked the question just so people kind of look at this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6573)|
| 1:49:39| With the john aside and say hey, you know the future looks bright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| Maybe it does but only if we don't spend much money, which means cuts programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6582)|
| 1:49:46| So the 102 and the 94 would probably include advanced tree funding which which makes that number look high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6586)|
| 1:49:54| So what we actually issued on new bonds was was lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6594)|
| 1:49:59| So that's why it jumps those two numbers though the one high number was the 90| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6599)|
| 1:50:04| Million dollars it did include the majority of the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| And listen, I know we've been here a long time two other really quick questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6607)|
| 1:50:12| One of them is we we've used on page 40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| You turn to page 40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6618)|
| 1:50:19| under debt service fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| Second column down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| You see how that peaked at 23 24 million dollars and it dropped to 14 and nine now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6624)|
| 1:50:28| I know that wasn't funded. I think in this last budget. Is that i'm not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| Mistake and I think that's the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| But but that's it's been explained to me. That's kind of like the county's net worth that we're dipping into to cover budget shortages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6634)|
| 1:50:42| And so is that is that a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6642)|
| 1:50:45| So on budgets not necessarily actual because that might change with the actual but on the budgets we're making up budget shortages by drawing down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6645)|
| 1:50:53| On the debt service fund no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| We keep operating completely separate from from capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6655)|
| 1:50:59| So operating is completely separate from capital the decrease in that debt service fund from 24 to 14| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6659)|
| 1:51:08| Would be we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6668)|
| 1:51:11| Loan schools 10 12 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6671)|
| 1:51:16| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6676)|
| 1:51:17| The train was 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6677)|
| 1:51:18| So we loan the schools 12 million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| For a train project that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| That had not been funded in the past. They should have been issued bonds for so instead of issuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6685)|
| 1:51:30| New debt because we had a high fund balance in debt service. We just loaned them the money they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6690)|
| 1:51:36| Pay that back over 10 years so that fund will be replenished to where it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6696)|
| 1:51:42| It looks like still going down so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| Would well that's an estimate and so that's an estimate based off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| We always estimate our debt service payments on our variable rate debt at four and a half percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6709)|
| 1:51:55| And we haven't been paying but probably two or two and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| Last question to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| As representatives of the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| You fund a lot of money sheriff's department school systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6726)|
| 1:52:10| What criteria do you use to recognize efficiencies for instance for the sheriff's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6730)|
| 1:52:15| And for the school system when you approve this budget that you're going to approve probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6735)|
| 1:52:19| What do you look at to judge whether they're spending the money wisely or not? Is there a set of criteria that you've developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6739)|
| 1:52:25| Specifically let's say for the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| Which has come under a little criticism for being top heavy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| And the schools what how do you look at that as a as a commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6750)|
| 1:52:35| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6755)|
| 1:52:43| Think we look we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| We look at the cost compared to the year before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6765)|
| 1:52:48| And we look at the quality of satisfaction that the citizenry has with the services they're receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6768)|
| 1:52:54| And I guess that's the basic way you could judge this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| Is that I mean, I mean I understand most people look at that year over year budgets three percent 2.6 percent this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6777)|
| 1:53:03| That seems very reasonable and and you do have to understand that in both of those budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6783)|
| 1:53:10| We do not get to say any way in which that money is spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| We we fund it and then they spend it. We have no operation control over school's budget or really even the sheriff's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6793)|
| 1:53:20| Who does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6800)|
| 1:53:21| Because it's a share of the school board, but but ultimately if you don't fund it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6801)|
| 1:53:26| Well, we have some we have to fund a certain amount of the school board. It's called maintenance of effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6806)|
| 1:53:31| Well, all i'm suggesting is is there should be some discussion within this group about expected criteria for the money that that you're appropriating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6811)|
| 1:53:40| You know just the performance guides that you develop with the sheriff's department and with the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6820)|
| 1:53:46| To say here are the expectations you've met them. So you get your money or you didn't meet them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6826)|
| 1:53:50| So, you know, maybe we need to have another discussion as to why you get your money if you didn't meet your expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6835)|
| 1:53:56| One thing that I might add when you see uh incremental money's added i'm just going to use the schools for example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6836)|
| 1:54:01| Uh, we've had programs over the years and i'm thinking of a reading program that we implemented where we spent money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6841)|
| 1:54:07| The school had asked for some money, uh above what our budgeted number was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6847)|
| 1:54:12| And we implemented a defined service contract to measure reading outcomes to generate incremental monies for the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6852)|
| 1:54:19| And you do see uh, and i'm just that's one of the discussion items that we're seeing right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6859)|
| 1:54:24| I believe as it relates to when we find out what our if our surplus will be it relates to programs such as project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6864)|
| 1:54:30| incremental funding for project grad or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6870)|
| 1:54:33| Or the the magnet programs at a couple of our schools a lot of that funding in that particular area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6873)|
| 1:54:39| Might be tied to a defined service contract, which has got some measurables related to uh outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6879)|
| 1:54:45| Uh, but I also will reiterate what my friend commissioner smith had said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6885)|
| 1:54:49| interestingly and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6889)|
| 1:54:51| Believe it or not. It's equally frustrating for us as it might be for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6891)|
| 1:54:56| is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| By law, we cannot uh dictate to the uh, the school board, you know how they spend their money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6898)|
| 1:55:04| You know, we will work closely to help them with their budget. But you know, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| We can't by law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| Uh, you know try to for lack of a better word metal in their affairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6910)|
| 1:55:13| We want to work with them closely and help them get the resources that they need but by law we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| We can't get that deeply involved with our partners at the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6918)|
| 1:55:23| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6923)|
| 1:55:23| well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6923)|
| 1:55:24| Also, I was going to say we do have an internal audit department that is actually a subset of the knox county commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6924)|
| 1:55:31| That does go into these different areas to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6931)|
| 1:55:35| Audits of those departments they do go into the schools. They go into engineering and public works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6935)|
| 1:55:41| You know to check to see if there's still the amount of tools that are supposed to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| So and and they do it on a periodic basis they go to our libraries to see if the books are still there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6944)|
| 1:55:52| um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6952)|
| 1:55:53| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6953)|
| 1:55:54| So we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6954)|
| 1:55:55| You know, there are some controls there. Plus we also have an external auditor, too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6955)|
| 1:56:01| Well, listen, I appreciate all the work the time I sat through this meeting my first meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6961)|
| 1:56:05| I would hate to have to come back here on a regular basis and do this. So I appreciate your all's efforts. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6965)|
| 1:56:11| Mr. Carr if you want to step around here a minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6971)|
| 1:56:13| I'll show you where that information is on our county website that you first your first question, by the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6973)|
| 1:56:19| I think this is great that you're here and you know, our community would be a better place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6979)|
| 1:56:23| We had more people engaged in asking these questions. So you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6983)|
| 1:56:26| This is the best you're talking right now. I mean, that's the best part of this whole meeting today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6986)|
| 1:56:30| So, thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate your time. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| Anybody else that commission want to discuss anything amongst ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=6997)|
| 1:56:43| We're adjourned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom180530BudgetWS?start=7003)|
