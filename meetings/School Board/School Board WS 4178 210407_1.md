| 2:30:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9043)|
| 2:30:44| Anything else for the moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9044)|
| 2:30:46| Mr. Deukler, please weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9046)|
| 2:30:47| Yeah, I hate to say anything either, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9047)|
| 2:30:48| I would just say that the current policy does not require wearing masks outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9048)|
| 2:30:55| It does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9055)|
| 2:30:56| It never did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9056)|
| 2:30:57| You know, it requires while attending school, or a school function, in any school building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9057)|
| 2:31:04| that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9064)|
| 2:31:05| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9065)|
| 2:31:06| I think that we've had some, we've asked for clarification on implementation and we continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9066)|
| 2:31:11| to have issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9071)|
| 2:31:12| So I agree, that's why I supported that policy when we did it because it did have that caveat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9072)|
| 2:31:18| in it, but it just feels like we still have principals who are determined that kids are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9078)|
| 2:31:22| going to wear masks and I think that's unfortunate because I think there is room for it in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9082)|
| 2:31:26| policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9086)|
| 2:31:27| Okay, if that is it, I think that is the end of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9087)|
| 2:31:31| Did you want to say anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9091)|
| 2:31:33| Are you good on the discussion about the reopening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9093)|
| 2:31:36| Not really, but I don't think we're getting where I want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9096)|
| 2:31:39| Well, I think that we need to give the superintendent time to go back, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9099)|
| 2:31:44| Honestly, I felt like we had a recommendation and a plan from the superintendent, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9104)|
| 2:31:50| we kind of have totally ignored tonight and we have totally focused on the face covering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9110)|
| 2:31:55| policy and so that's a little bit my confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9115)|
| 2:31:59| I feel like the superintendent came with a recommendation to us and we have all talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9119)|
| 2:32:03| around it and talked about everything else and asked him to come up with something else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9123)|
| 2:32:08| and we just never actually have addressed what he recommended and that's kind of where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9128)|
| 2:32:15| I'm having a little bit of a problem tonight because he came with a recommendation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9135)|
| 2:32:19| we keep going like, we'll come back next week with a recommendation, well, we have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9139)|
| 2:32:25| So that's a little bit where I'm having problems because what if he comes back with this same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9145)|
| 2:32:31| recommendation next week, y'all all seem to want to ignore it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9151)|
| 2:32:34| I mean, that's kind of, that sort of seems to be what I'm getting from y'all is y'all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9154)|
| 2:32:38| are ignoring it by not addressing it because all we've talked about is this face covering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9158)|
| 2:32:42| policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9162)|
| 2:32:44| So anyway, that's kind of where I'm having a problem with our discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9164)|
| 2:32:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9167)|
| 2:32:48| I can appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9168)|
| 2:32:49| I mean, I think that's a very valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9169)|
| 2:32:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9171)|
| 2:32:52| We've gotten very sidetracked by one portion of it because if you look at it, that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9172)|
| 2:32:55| first piece and then it goes to physical distancing, daily temperature checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9175)|
| 2:32:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9179)|
| 2:33:00| Superintendent Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9180)|
| 2:33:01| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9181)|
| 2:33:02| I'll make this real brief, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9182)|
| 2:33:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9183)|
| 2:33:04| Superintendent, you and I talked earlier this week and when you and I talked, I said we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9184)|
| 2:33:08| can't make the mass decision in isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9188)|
| 2:33:10| We need your recommendation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9190)|
| 2:33:12| And I know you were going to give one anyway, but then you provided a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9192)|
| 2:33:16| I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9196)|
| 2:33:17| To me, it's a little bit about semantics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9197)|
| 2:33:18| To me, when the public hears recommendation, it's a little loose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9198)|
| 2:33:22| So if he goes back and just puts at the top of the header, here's my plan for this school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9202)|
| 2:33:27| year, I'm down with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9207)|
| 2:33:29| But that was the only reason why I asked the question about your formal plan because recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9209)|
| 2:33:36| can sound a little bit loose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9216)|
| 2:33:38| So, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9218)|
| 2:33:40| And I sort of got the feeling you didn't like my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9220)|
| 2:33:43| So I'll come back with something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9223)|
| 2:33:48| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9228)|
| 2:33:49| And I think it has been helpful for the superintendent to hear this discussion and maybe he can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9229)|
| 2:33:57| along with his staff, revisit that plan or recommendation because I think from hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9237)|
| 2:34:05| the will of the board tonight and hearing the speakers at public forum and hearing especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9245)|
| 2:34:10| what Dr. Childs said, I mean, I think we need to seriously, he needs to seriously, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9250)|
| 2:34:18| was a very concrete, like, okay, here, I'm going to follow CDC, I don't think it's as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9258)|
| 2:34:24| easy as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9264)|
| 2:34:25| And I think he and his staff need to take all of this discussion into account before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9265)|
| 2:34:30| he makes a new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9270)|
| 2:34:32| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9272)|
| 2:34:33| And I don't think that we, and I hear you, Virginia, completely, I do, but I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9273)|
| 2:34:41| we fully ignored it because I'm looking at his recommendation and he indicates guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9281)|
| 2:34:46| may change in several ways in the school year progresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9286)|
| 2:34:49| So I feel like this conversation, my interpretation is just where are we at at a board level to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9289)|
| 2:34:55| get rid of the policy and go back to the procedure to where it falls under superintendent's guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9295)|
| 2:35:01| in a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9301)|
| 2:35:02| And so I think the only thing that he would take out from this perspective is following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9302)|
| 2:35:09| the CDC versus, like, recommendations from the CDC and what it's looking like in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9309)|
| 2:35:14| particular community, like adding that type of language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9314)|
| 2:35:17| But this conversation I feel was just a matter of getting rid of that emergency policy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9317)|
| 2:35:24| sunsetting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9324)|
| 2:35:25| It took us two hours to get there, but we got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9325)|
| 2:35:28| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9328)|
| 2:35:29| Thank you, Madam Chair and Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9329)|
| 2:35:33| I think that, you know, the recommendations and the plan, face coverings was such a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9333)|
| 2:35:39| part of that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9339)|
| 2:35:41| And I think that's why it kind of, I don't think it got side railed, it just, it's such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9341)|
| 2:35:45| a, you know, passionate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9345)|
| 2:35:48| And so I think that's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9348)|
| 2:35:49| And I think that this discussion was good because when I got that plan, you know, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9349)|
| 2:35:53| had an issue with that, the contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9353)|
| 2:35:56| So I think it's good to hear what the board members have to say because when that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9356)|
| 2:35:59| came out, it's like, here's the plan, but we haven't had a meaningful discussion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9359)|
| 2:36:03| where we stood on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9363)|
| 2:36:05| We all, you know, we all feel differently about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9365)|
| 2:36:08| We're on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9368)|
| 2:36:09| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9369)|
| 2:36:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9370)|
| 2:36:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9371)|
| 2:36:12| The only thing I would say is, I would, I would think that no matter what Dr. Buchanan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9372)|
| 2:36:24| said in reference to the CDC, they've been a little bit, not nearly as bad, but Dr. Fauci| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9384)|
| 2:36:35| is supposed to be the world's authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9395)|
| 2:36:40| And I think he's more concerned with being a celebrity than he is because he's been everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9400)|
| 2:36:46| all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9406)|
| 2:36:48| If you don't believe it, you just go back and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9408)|
| 2:36:51| He's one place and he's somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9411)|
| 2:36:54| So what my recommendation would be to the superintendent is stay within the confines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9414)|
| 2:37:01| of the state of Tennessee in coming up with your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9421)|
| 2:37:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9426)|
| 2:37:07| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9427)|
| 2:37:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9429)|
| 2:37:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9430)|
| 2:37:11| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9431)|
| 2:37:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9432)|
| 2:37:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9433)|
| 2:37:14| We're going to take a 15 minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9434)|
| 2:37:15| We'll start back at eight o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9435)|
| 2:37:16| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9436)|
| 2:37:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9437)|
| 2:37:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9438)|
| 2:37:19| So let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9439)|
| 2:37:20| We've got, we're almost all back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9440)|
| 2:37:21| Are you ready, my dear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9441)|
| 2:37:22| Are they so excited for her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9442)|
| 2:37:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9443)|
| 2:37:54| Okay, we're going to start with public forum and I do want to remind everybody with public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9474)|
| 2:38:00| forum that there is five minute limit and at five minutes you will have a timer and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9480)|
| 2:38:05| we will have to stop you speaking at five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9485)|
| 2:38:08| I also am going to call two names at a time so that you can first name and then the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9488)|
| 2:38:13| behind so that you can just get lined up to know that you're going to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9493)|
| 2:38:17| So first, Amber Burns and after that, Hillary Godsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9497)|
| 2:38:33| And if you would just state your name and county of residence and you have five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9513)|
| 2:38:36| to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9516)|
| 2:38:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9517)|
| 2:38:38| My name is Amber Burns, Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9518)|
| 2:38:40| I just want to start out by saying thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9520)|
| 2:38:43| We realize this is time consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9523)|
| 2:38:45| We do appreciate the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9525)|
| 2:38:47| I came in with something prepared so I wouldn't get off track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9527)|
| 2:38:50| However, y'all had my whole conversation for me and answered a lot of what I was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9530)|
| 2:38:54| to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9534)|
| 2:38:55| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9535)|
| 2:38:56| I also appreciate those who have read our emails and replied back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9536)|
| 2:39:01| So I just want to kind of start in speaking overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9541)|
| 2:39:05| We really appreciate that you're trying to allow a safe environment in which you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9545)|
| 2:39:08| can communicate and we can also communicate with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9548)|
| 2:39:12| Unfortunately, this has not been such an environment and this is due to the impact of social media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9552)|
| 2:39:18| as you all have experienced, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9558)|
| 2:39:20| We all kind of get branded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9560)|
| 2:39:22| As you all should be well aware from emails, after a previous meeting, parents who spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9562)|
| 2:39:27| were harassed online and threatening comments were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9567)|
| 2:39:30| This was further instigated by a school member or a school board member who seems to join| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9570)|
| 2:39:37| those discussions online quite frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9577)|
| 2:39:41| Tonight I'm asking that we as Knox County citizens better ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9581)|
| 2:39:44| I'm asking that we look at each other and have grace and dignity and agree that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9584)|
| 2:39:50| disagree and that's okay, which is exactly what you guys showed us tonight and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9590)|
| 2:39:54| okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9594)|
| 2:39:55| That's healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9595)|
| 2:39:56| I would ask that no matter what's said, because as it was pointed out by Mr. Watson, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9596)|
| 2:40:02| always two sides or more to everything and there's two sides to this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9602)|
| 2:40:07| Masks and vaccines are very heated topics and everybody has emotions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9607)|
| 2:40:13| However, I would ask that that's taken into account and there would be no harassing or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9613)|
| 2:40:19| threatening done, if possible, by other Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9619)|
| 2:40:25| Some of us even felt like our kids were threatened last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| There was even information given on some of our names specifically and it was said, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9628)|
| 2:40:33| you should make sure all the teachers in those schools know the kids to those parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9633)|
| 2:40:38| And I do feel like that is a public safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9638)|
| 2:40:41| I just wanted to mention that publicly because I would ask for that to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9641)|
| 2:40:45| Our kids are watching not only these conversations we're having, but also how we're reacting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9645)|
| 2:40:50| to them as parents and I don't feel like that's healthy and I shouldn't have to worry about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9650)|
| 2:40:54| for the safety of my child after I speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9654)|
| 2:40:58| So I just kind of want to mention, it was brought up tonight, mental health issues with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9658)|
| 2:41:02| kids wearing masks specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9662)|
| 2:41:05| I would just say as a parent, a lot of us have seen this directly, Ms. Bounds kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9665)|
| 2:41:09| mentioned it for her grandkids, my daughter's in kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9669)|
| 2:41:13| When she first started school, she knew no one at her school and she came home and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9673)|
| 2:41:17| mom, I'm having a really hard time making friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9677)|
| 2:41:20| When we go outside, because that school is following what they thought was the policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9680)|
| 2:41:24| they're wearing masks and she said, mom, I have to choose between making friends or wearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9684)|
| 2:41:31| a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9691)|
| 2:41:32| And so she said, I can play by myself and take my mask off, or if I want to play with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9692)|
| 2:41:37| someone and try to meet them, I have to wear my mask and it's really hot, mom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9697)|
| 2:41:41| What do I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9701)|
| 2:41:42| It took them a long time to meet each other this year, to get to know each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9702)|
| 2:41:47| I'm still not sure that she may know everybody in class because of the segregation, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9707)|
| 2:41:51| to keep them safe, you know, within the guidelines, you know, that we're following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9711)|
| 2:41:55| But I would say parents know those impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9715)|
| 2:41:58| The medical community, I haven't told my pediatrician, but I think my daughter has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9718)|
| 2:42:02| felt isolated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9722)|

| 2:42:08| That is not something a kindergartner needs to be talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9728)|
| 2:42:11| There is a huge impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9731)|
| 2:42:12| I pray to goodness and I pray a lot to God that she will never remember this, but you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9732)|
| 2:42:18| know, there's a huge impact on our kids that these, these medical professionals can't talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9738)|
| 2:42:22| about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9742)|
| 2:42:23| And I also want to point out kids wear masks the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9743)|
| 2:42:27| When we're able to go into office spaces by ourselves, we're able to distance ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9747)|
| 2:42:31| enough that we can take our mask off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9751)|
| 2:42:33| The kids do not have that same opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9753)|
| 2:42:35| So when we say, Hey, we may choose to not wear a mask when we go into public, what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9755)|
| 2:42:40| saying is, nope, our kids need to go to school, wear a mask all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9760)|
| 2:42:43| No exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9763)|
| 2:42:44| Because even if they have a medical exception, it was just pointed out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9764)|
| 2:42:48| If they don't wear a mask and the policy is they have to, they're going to be picked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9768)|
| 2:42:53| Even if there's a valid reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9773)|
| 2:42:54| And I'd like to point out my experience tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9774)|
| 2:42:56| I've been vaccinated for months and there was no question asked to me when I came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9776)|
| 2:43:03| if I was vaccinated and I needed to wear my mask while I was still three distant, three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9783)|
| 2:43:07| feet apart from everybody, we, we can't keep with the same information that we have because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9787)|
| 2:43:12| it's constantly changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9792)|
| 2:43:13| My other question is, you know, it's kind of mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9793)|
| 2:43:17| Parents will not feel as though they're safe sending their kids to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9797)|
| 2:43:19| If we don't wear a mask, if vaccines are the end game, would those parents get their kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9799)|
| 2:43:24| vaccinated to then make them still safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9804)|
| 2:43:27| I think you may find that some of those same parents are not wanting to get their kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9807)|
| 2:43:31| vaccinated because that's a very heated subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9811)|
| 2:43:33| What I'm asking is that you give us the choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9813)|
| 2:43:36| I feel as though parents are the best ones to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9816)|
| 2:43:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9821)|
| 2:43:42| Next we have Hillary Godsey and after her is Kevin Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9822)|
| 2:43:45| Ms. Warren, I believe by policy we can make a comment after a public forum speaker, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9825)|
| 2:43:52| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9832)|
| 2:43:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9833)|
| 2:43:54| I'm not going to do this for all 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9834)|
| 2:43:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9836)|
| 2:43:57| But I do want to go on public to miss Burns concern about being harassed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9837)|
| 2:44:03| Um, I, I, I know I can speak for myself and I don't think anybody on the board has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9843)|
| 2:44:09| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9849)|
| 2:44:10| I know she's speaking about people in the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9850)|
| 2:44:11| Um, and I just would want to go on record to say that's should not be tolerated and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9851)|
| 2:44:16| nobody should be harassed or threatened, uh, around this discussion or any other discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9856)|
| 2:44:22| And I was really pleased in all the phone calls that I had and the emails that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9862)|
| 2:44:26| was only one person that made me uncomfortable in that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9866)|
| 2:44:30| And I politely dismissed the conversation and ended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9870)|
| 2:44:34| Um, and I think we all have the right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9874)|
| 2:44:36| And I would continue want to elevate what Ms. Burns is saying and saying, no matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9876)|
| 2:44:41| how passionate you feel about this, let's keep it civil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9881)|
| 2:44:45| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9885)|
| 2:44:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9888)|
| 2:44:49| Hillary Godsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9889)|
| 2:44:50| And Kevin Hill after her, Ms. Godsey, if you just say your name, uh, County of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9890)|
| 2:44:56| and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9896)|

| 2:45:01| Um, I too had something prepared, but I think that you guys hit every single bullet point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9901)|
| 2:45:06| that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9906)|
| 2:45:07| And I just want to say thank you because at least we're having the conversation and that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9907)|
| 2:45:11| I think one of the biggest things that we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9911)|
| 2:45:14| We just wanted to hear that what we were feeling was valid, that we wanted to have discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9914)|
| 2:45:19| about it and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9919)|
| 2:45:21| Um, and I don't know if I'm allowed to do this, but I just want to pray over you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9921)|
| 2:45:26| because you're in a really tough place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9926)|
| 2:45:28| I don't want your seat, not for one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9928)|
| 2:45:31| And so I don't ever want you guys to feel like, like we're against you because we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9931)|
| 2:45:36| working with you and we might not agree, but I want what's best for our kids just as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9936)|
| 2:45:42| as you guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9942)|
| 2:45:43| And I want to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9943)|
| 2:45:44| So if I'm allowed to do that, am I allowed to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9944)|
| 2:45:48| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9948)|
| 2:45:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9949)|

| 2:45:51| Heavenly Father, I just thank you so much for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9951)|
| 2:45:52| I thank you for every single person that's on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9952)|

| 2:46:02| I pray that you would give them wisdom, that you would send people in their paths to, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9962)|
| 2:46:06| give them direction and to give them wisdom on what to do with our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9966)|
| 2:46:10| Father, I pray for our kids right now that they are the ones who are experiencing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9970)|
| 2:46:14| And for our teachers, I pray peace over them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9974)|
| 2:46:16| I pray discernment, wisdom over them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9976)|
| 2:46:19| I pray that they feel safe in their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9979)|
| 2:46:20| I pray against mental health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9980)|
| 2:46:23| I pray that you would just have your way, um, just in the board and the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9983)|
| 2:46:27| Father, you are so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9987)|
| 2:46:29| And we just come before you now and just ask for Knox County just to have this peace of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9989)|
| 2:46:33| mind when going over this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9993)|
| 2:46:35| I pray for our superintendent father, for his office and his staff, that you would just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9995)|
| 2:46:38| give them wisdom, give them discernment and just continue to move forward father with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=9998)|
| 2:46:43| all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10003)|
| 2:46:44| We love you, Jesus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10004)|
| 2:46:45| And we just thank you for this time together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10005)|
| 2:46:46| In Jesus name, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10006)|
| 2:46:49| Thank you, Kevin Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10009)|
| 2:46:51| And then Rebecca Reeves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10011)|
| 2:46:55| This past year, I'm sorry, Kevin Hill, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10015)|
| 2:47:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10020)|
| 2:47:01| This past year has been marked by a colossal failure from the local level and national| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10021)|
| 2:47:06| levels in leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10026)|
| 2:47:08| While initial reactions that violated rights of citizens are debatably excusable as errors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10028)|
| 2:47:15| in judgment, to now be a year out persisting in these errors is a complete dereliction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10035)|
| 2:47:21| of duty by any elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10041)|
| 2:47:24| In regard to your responsibility as a school board member by August of this past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10044)|
| 2:47:30| despite what Dr Buchanan has claimed, we had plenty of evidence that there was not significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10050)|
| 2:47:35| spread of COVID-19 by children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10055)|
| 2:47:38| The county's own policy didn't require masks under the age of 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10058)|
| 2:47:42| So no school should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10062)|
| 2:47:45| As of now, we not only have on the local level, empirical evidence that masking people has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10065)|
| 2:47:54| no effect on the spread of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10074)|
| 2:47:57| We also have those results and data from other nations and other states that have taken radically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10077)|
| 2:48:01| different approaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| Loudoun County, Blount County, no mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10083)|
| 2:48:06| Knox County, mask mandate, no difference in case numbers or death rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10086)|
| 2:48:13| I'd like an explanation for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10093)|
| 2:48:15| If it's because, well, they masked anyway, fine, then we've just proven that personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10095)|
| 2:48:19| choice works and we don't need to mandate anything to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10099)|
| 2:48:23| The data is in, there is no merit to masking policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10103)|
| 2:48:28| And so to persist in them, the school board is crossing over from erring on the side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10108)|
| 2:48:33| caution to openly engaging in child abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10113)|
| 2:48:36| I realize that it is a harsh assessment of the board's current policies, but it must| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10116)|
| 2:48:41| be said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10121)|
| 2:48:43| Psychological abuse is defined by our government as a pattern of behavior that impairs a child's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10123)|
| 2:48:50| emotional development or sense of self-worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10130)|
| 2:48:53| We can list off the laundry list of those, I emailed them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10133)|

| 2:49:00| The actions that have been taken in the past year toward our children have directly engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10140)|

| 2:51:48| I had a fever and a sore throat and the whole nine yards so I went to a CDS walk-in clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10308)|
| 2:51:52| Flu test was negative, strep test was negative and there were no COVID tests back then because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10312)|
| 2:51:57| this was like in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10317)|
| 2:51:59| So the doctor says you've got to go home and isolate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10319)|
| 2:52:01| But while I was there, she said go get your supplies and what you need real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10321)|
| 2:52:04| So she hands me some masks and gloves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10324)|
| 2:52:07| But she doesn't just hand them to me and say just put them on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10327)|
| 2:52:09| She said there is responsibility with these that I need you to know and I need you to listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10329)|
| 2:52:14| and I need you to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10334)|
| 2:52:15| So this was my training in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10335)|
| 2:52:17| I'm probably the first person in Knox County to wear a mask and I did it happily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10337)|
| 2:52:21| She said when you put these gloves on and you walk out of this store, I want you to dispose of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10341)|
| 2:52:26| in the trash can outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10346)|

| 2:52:29| This is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10349)|

| 2:52:33| She said when you put on this mask, grab a bottle of the loopholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10353)|
| 2:52:35| She said the second that you touch your mask, it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10355)|
| 2:52:38| Throw it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10358)|
| 2:52:39| Discard it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10359)|
| 2:52:40| She said if you don't get everything you need in this store and you have to go to another store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10360)|
| 2:52:43| leave that mask on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10363)|
| 2:52:44| That's probably why we see people driving with masks maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10364)|
| 2:52:46| But you don't take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10366)|
| 2:52:48| She said the second you take it off and you put it in your car, you touch it, your thumb gets in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10368)|
| 2:52:52| It's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10372)|
| 2:52:53| Do you understand me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10373)|
| 2:52:55| And I said yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10375)|
| 2:52:56| I understand you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10376)|
| 2:52:57| And I took it seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10377)|
| 2:52:58| So imagine my surprise when all of a sudden July comes and Knox County mandates masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10378)|
| 2:53:02| Just wear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10382)|

| 2:53:06| Wear your mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10386)|
| 2:53:07| And I'm going, does anybody understand the responsibility with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10387)|
| 2:53:09| And then our kids are in masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10389)|
| 2:53:12| And let me tell you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10392)|
| 2:53:13| My kids would army crawl on a public restroom floor if I let them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10393)|
| 2:53:16| They are not the same as a surgeon when I hear people say, oh, well, we let surgeons wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10396)|
| 2:53:20| Why can't kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10400)|
| 2:53:21| Have you met children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10401)|
| 2:53:23| And I'm sorry, yes, as Martha Buchanan said, it is our responsibility as parents to teach them stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10403)|
| 2:53:28| But if you've ever had children, it is a lifetime of teaching them how to do proper things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10408)|
| 2:53:33| And I'm not going to teach my kids how to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10413)|
| 2:53:35| I'm not going to teach them how to put duct tape on their mouth or tie their hands behind their backs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10415)|
| 2:53:39| I'm not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10419)|
| 2:53:41| How many times a day are our children touching their masks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10421)|
| 2:53:44| Their masks are done before they even get into the school room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10424)|
| 2:53:47| They're over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10427)|

| 2:53:51| They are coated in Doritos, Crust, and Funk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10431)|
| 2:53:54| I would like for someone to put them under a microscope to see what's under there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10434)|
| 2:53:57| That is not health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10437)|
| 2:53:58| All that matters is that their mouth and their nose is covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10438)|
| 2:54:01| That's the only thing that matters to most people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10441)|
| 2:54:03| I mean, some kids could be, what, probably going into their grandma's closet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10443)|

| 2:54:17| Does it matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10457)|
| 2:54:18| No, because it's not about health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10458)|
| 2:54:20| It's about obedience and compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10460)|
| 2:54:22| And I'm done with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10462)|
| 2:54:23| My children will not be wearing a mask in the fall, even if they go to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10463)|

| 2:54:33| Have you looked at the cities, the counties, and the states in America where the pandemic is the worst?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10473)|
| 2:54:37| Mask compliance is the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10477)|
| 2:54:40| They have the highest mask compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10480)|
| 2:54:42| I'm not the CDC, thank God, because I can do simple science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10482)|
| 2:54:46| And I have been told for a long time that I am anti-science| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10486)|
| 2:54:49| when I found out two weeks ago in the court of law that the CDC testified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10489)|
| 2:54:52| that they are not using RCT studies to make their decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10492)|
| 2:54:55| Did you all know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10495)|
| 2:54:56| They're using observational studies, which is anti-science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10496)|
| 2:54:58| So hallelujah, glory to God, I have been pro-science this whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10498)|
| 2:55:01| So I say that we fire the CDC and we get a second opinion because in my book, they're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10501)|
| 2:55:06| And me and my family will not follow the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10506)|
| 2:55:08| Me and my family will not be wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10508)|
| 2:55:10| And this mask has turned into a monster because we keep feeding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10510)|
| 2:55:14| And we also keep feeding bacteria on the backside of our masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10514)|
| 2:55:18| And our kids are breathing it in and they're breathing it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10518)|
| 2:55:20| If you touch something and it has COVID on it and then you touch your mask, guess what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10520)|
| 2:55:24| In your nostrils and in your lungs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10524)|
| 2:55:26| And like I said again, it is not rocket science to figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10526)|
| 2:55:30| I do not want this school board or anybody else to follow the recommendations of the CDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10530)|

| 2:55:41| And I'm very passionate about it because I have three children that will be in school coming up this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10541)|
| 2:55:45| A kindergartner, a first grader, and a second grader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10545)|
| 2:55:47| And they are little. Please let them be little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10547)|
| 2:55:49| And please let them see their friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10549)|
| 2:55:51| My kindergartner came home to me yesterday and said she finally made a friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10551)|
| 2:55:55| So, I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10555)|
| 2:55:57| And I look forward to hearing how well we'll no longer be using the CDC in our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10557)|
| 2:56:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10561)|

| 2:56:12| If you would state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10572)|
| 2:56:15| Hi, my name is Monica Haas and I'm a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10575)|
| 2:56:18| I have two young children in Knox County's school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10578)|
| 2:56:21| I'm curious, when your kids were little, did you ever ask them for their opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10581)|
| 2:56:25| I decided to ask my kids what they thought about masks, since that's what we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10585)|
| 2:56:30| My six-year-old didn't really say anything. He just went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10590)|
| 2:56:34| My eight-year-old said that masks were hot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10594)|
| 2:56:37| I know you're thinking that we can't just leave this decision up to the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10597)|
| 2:56:42| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10602)|
| 2:56:43| Because they're not mature enough yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10603)|
| 2:56:45| But they're living this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10605)|
| 2:56:46| They understand what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10606)|
| 2:56:48| They have lived with this for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10608)|
| 2:56:50| Adults have not been able to handle this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10610)|
| 2:56:53| The kids know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10613)|
| 2:56:57| Their opinions really should be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10617)|
| 2:57:00| So, why is it important to see the whole face?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10620)|
| 2:57:03| Not being able to see the whole face does impact learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10623)|
| 2:57:06| Some kindergartners are going to be speech delayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10626)|
| 2:57:09| due to not being able to see their teacher's mouth this past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10629)|
| 2:57:12| because they didn't get to learn how to correctly form words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10632)|
| 2:57:15| Also know that it's important to speech therapists as well as special education classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10635)|
| 2:57:20| Students need to see the whole face to learn facial expressions as well as forming words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10640)|
| 2:57:25| How much time will teachers have to spend on reteaching something next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10645)|
| 2:57:29| that students should have already learned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10649)|
| 2:57:31| How further delayed will speech ed special education students be delayed due to this past year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10651)|
| 2:57:38| Superintendent Thomas, back in February, you stated, and I'll quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10658)|
| 2:57:43| With the vaccination, I'm very optimistic that we can hopefully be back to some sense of normalcy in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10663)|
| 2:57:49| The vaccination is now available for 16 years old and up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10669)|
| 2:57:53| and by August, each teacher and staff member that wants the vaccine will have the opportunity to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10673)|
| 2:58:00| The decision to mask should be left up to parents or guardians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10680)|
| 2:58:03| At this point in the pandemic, either the vaccine works or it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10683)|
| 2:58:08| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10688)|
| 2:58:11| Thank you. Angie Gothert and then Patty King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10691)|
| 2:58:32| Yes, please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10712)|
| 2:58:34| Hi, I'm Angie Gothert, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10714)|
| 2:58:36| Thank you for allowing me to speak. I appreciate all of you for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10716)|
| 2:58:40| I want to thank you for the time you spent in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10720)|
| 2:58:42| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10722)|
| 2:58:44| I know that it's hard and I appreciate the time that you spent doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10724)|
| 2:58:48| And it does mean a lot to us to know that you're invested and we get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10728)|
| 2:58:56| So we're here to discuss the policies for next year and the recommendations of our superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10736)|
| 2:59:01| I believe that masks should be optional next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10741)|
| 2:59:04| As you're thinking of masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10744)|
| 2:59:07| I would like for you to consider how you personally are required to wear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10747)|
| 2:59:10| I would think most of you have the ability to go without one most of the time, or at least only to have to wear them in and out of the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10750)|
| 2:59:18| If you wear them a long time during the day, you understand what our children are going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10758)|
| 2:59:24| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10764)|
| 2:59:26| If you do wear a mask for prolonged periods of time, are you constantly yelled at to pull it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10766)|
| 2:59:31| Are you told you're wearing it improperly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10771)|
| 2:59:34| Are you threatened with an office referral or write up on your permanent record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10774)|
| 2:59:39| If you do not wear a mask for hours uninterrupted a day, I encourage you to try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10779)|
| 2:59:44| Also, please wear one while you're doing any kind of physical activity for at least 30 minutes or up to two hours without a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10784)|
| 2:59:52| I believe only then will you understand what our children are going through every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10792)|
| 2:59:56| Mental health issues in our children have skyrocketed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10796)|
| 2:59:59| A study last fall said that one in five children is seeking counseling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10799)|
| 3:00:03| That number is now four in ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10803)|
| 3:00:06| Boston hospitals have changed their COVID rooms into beds for the number of children being admitted for mental health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10806)|
| 3:00:13| I don't want that to happen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10813)|
| 3:00:15| Children as young as eight years old are being admitted for attempting suicide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10815)|
| 3:00:19| Teenagers are being diagnosed with eating disorders and requiring inpatient treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10819)|
| 3:00:23| Substance abuse is on the rise and so is inpatient treatment for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10823)|
| 3:00:27| All the while we sleep it aside saying it's only a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10827)|
| 3:00:31| A year to us is nothing. A year to our children is a lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10831)|
| 3:00:35| I've shared my many sources with all of you in studies and data on our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10835)|
| 3:00:40| Recently I shared a compilation of articles and data on what is happening to our children concerning the prolonged masking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10840)|
| 3:00:45| Mr. Watson responded to my email saying that my source was right-leaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10845)|
| 3:00:49| I was not aware the health and well-being of our children was political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10849)|
| 3:00:53| It's not. It's not for me and it shouldn't be for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10853)|
| 3:00:57| I was disappointed at the thought because the source had only compiled the data in studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10857)|
| 3:01:01| They had not done the data themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10861)|
| 3:01:04| I do want to share some renowned public health doctors have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10864)|
| 3:01:08| They are admitted progressives and have begun speaking truth this entire time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10868)|
| 3:01:12| They have also shared that their party has left them, talking about politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10872)|
| 3:01:16| Each of them has said they never believed that their party would leave children behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10876)|
| 3:01:21| But that's what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10881)|
| 3:01:24| Dr. Marty McCary of Johns Hopkins University shared that we should reach herd immunity by the end of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10884)|
| 3:01:29| He was vilified for saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10889)|
| 3:01:32| His findings were based on the fact that any adult who wants a vaccine will be able to get one by mid-April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10892)|
| 3:01:38| Dr. Vinay Prashad of UCSF has said that children do not need to be vaccinated for schools to return to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10898)|
| 3:01:45| Children are not driving this virus and we have known that for quite some time and we should act accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10905)|
| 3:01:51| Lastly, Dr. Monica Gandhi, and if you have looked her up, you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10911)|
| 3:01:55| She's fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10915)|
| 3:01:57| Also of UCSF, vaccines are the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10917)|
| 3:02:00| End. End of this. We're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10920)|
| 3:02:03| Combining natural immunity and vaccines is the way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10923)|
| 3:02:06| Once every adult who wants a vaccine gets one, there is no need for the things that have been imposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10926)|
| 3:02:12| Vaccinated teachers can safely be around children as they are the lowest risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10932)|
| 3:02:17| Masks are no longer necessary as vaccines provide the protection for those that are vulnerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10937)|
| 3:02:22| K-12 students are among the lowest risk on the planet, yet they are paying the highest price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10942)|
| 3:02:28| I wanted to know if the vaccines are the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10948)|
| 3:02:32| And Superintendent Thomas, you did state that, that vaccines were coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10952)|
| 3:02:36| Then I want to know what changed for you between that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10956)|
| 3:02:39| I was very disheartened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10959)|
| 3:02:41| As of today, we've vaccinated over 30% of the Knox County population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10961)|
| 3:02:45| And according to data, 41,000 have already had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10965)|
| 3:02:48| We know that number is higher, which is probably three to five times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10968)|
| 3:02:52| Herd immunity is close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10972)|
| 3:02:54| Schools all over the country are not only removing masks and other restrictions for next year, but they're doing them right now around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10974)|
| 3:03:00| Some never had any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10980)|
| 3:03:02| In Texas, there are over 70 districts that have made masks optional for the remainder of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10982)|
| 3:03:07| And more join every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10987)|
| 3:03:08| In their announcements to remove masks, they acknowledge that children have suffered more than most during this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10988)|
| 3:03:14| And allowing them to see smiles is crucial to their mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10994)|
| 3:03:18| Not one child from zero to seven has died of COVID, but we have lost several to suicide and overdose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=10998)|
| 3:03:24| I can only pray that they will forgive those that refuse to see them or hear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11004)|
| 3:03:28| Please allow parents to make all choices for their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11008)|
| 3:03:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11011)|
| 3:03:33| Sorry, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11013)|
| 3:03:35| Yes, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11015)|
| 3:03:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11016)|
| 3:03:37| Angie, you know that I have nothing but love for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11017)|
| 3:03:40| And you also know that my email did not say right-leaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11020)|
| 3:03:43| The quote was, as you know, the air has a pretty strong agenda, which is not atypical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11023)|
| 3:03:50| That being said, you know as well as I do that there are two camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11030)|
| 3:03:54| I did not say right-leaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11034)|
| 3:03:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11035)|
| 3:03:56| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11036)|
| 3:03:58| Okay, Patty King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11038)|
| 3:04:00| And then after Patty is Kay Stroud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11040)|
| 3:04:05| My name is Patty King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11045)|
| 3:04:06| I'm Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11046)|
| 3:04:08| I spoke to you guys last month as a business owner of a music academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11048)|
| 3:04:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11052)|
| 3:04:13| I'm here again to speak to you as that owner and also to tell you that I have students that are Knox County students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11053)|
| 3:04:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11059)|
| 3:04:20| These students have told my instructors over and over again that they can understand my husband and my other teacher because we do not require masks for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11060)|
| 3:04:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11071)|
| 3:04:32| We are not six feet apart from our students because we're in their home in a small room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11072)|
| 3:04:37| What we do is teach them and they can understand us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11077)|
| 3:04:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11083)|
| 3:04:44| They also say it's nice to be able to breathe why they are being taught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11084)|
| 3:04:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11090)|
| 3:04:51| These kids have said over and over again the masks are hot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11091)|
| 3:04:56| They can't hear each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11096)|
| 3:04:57| They can't hear the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11097)|
| 3:04:59| They can't understand what the teachers are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11099)|
| 3:05:02| These masks are hindering these students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11102)|
| 3:05:05| They are not helping these students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11105)|
| 3:05:08| These students constantly and we've seen evidence of second graders writing letters saying that the masks are hot and that they are that they can't understand their teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11108)|
| 3:05:20| We're hindering education and we need to stop hindering the education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11120)|
| 3:05:26| These students need to be able to read their teacher's lips, see their teacher's expressions, and learn from teachers without the mask on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11126)|
| 3:05:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11135)|
| 3:05:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11136)|
| 3:05:39| Kay Stroud and then Deborah Howard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11139)|
| 3:05:44| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11144)|
| 3:05:46| Kay Stroud, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11146)|
| 3:05:49| First, let me say you had a pretty healthy discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11149)|
| 3:05:54| I liked some of the things I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11154)|
| 3:05:56| Took some wind out of my sails, darn it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11156)|
| 3:05:58| But that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11158)|
| 3:06:01| First, let me start by saying that I actually don't have a dog in this fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11161)|
| 3:06:06| I don't have kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11166)|
| 3:06:07| And that is totally by design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11167)|
| 3:06:09| That is my own personal choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11169)|
| 3:06:12| So I'm only coming here as an observer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11172)|
| 3:06:16| I do have nieces and nephews and I live in a very large neighborhood and the children walk past my home, walking home from school a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11176)|
| 3:06:24| And some of the things I have observed is a lack of joy and happiness that I used to see before that I don't see now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11184)|
| 3:06:33| A parenting of attitudes of virtue signaling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11193)|
| 3:06:38| Screaming at siblings to stay away because so and so doesn't have their mask up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11198)|
| 3:06:46| Or that kid doesn't have one on and I'm going home to tell mom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11206)|
| 3:06:50| And this is all coming by my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11210)|
| 3:06:51| I live on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11211)|
| 3:06:54| Instead of teaching fear mongering and bullying and self-destructive behavior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11214)|
| 3:07:00| maybe we could try being adults that they can all look up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11220)|
| 3:07:05| Show them how to problem solve by learning nutritional skills and habits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11225)|
| 3:07:10| Keeping their immune system strong by playing outside in the sunshine and leaving the electronics in the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11230)|
| 3:07:16| Learn about vitamins and therapeutics to help reduce their fears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11236)|
| 3:07:21| Did you know we have therapeutics that not only prevent COVID but can cure it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11241)|
| 3:07:28| Yes, I said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11248)|
| 3:07:29| They can cure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11249)|
| 3:07:32| Look up Virology Journal, the official publication of Dr. Fauci, National Institute of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11252)|
| 3:07:41| published what is now a blockbuster article, August 22, 2005, under the heading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11261)|
| 3:07:53| Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11273)|
| 3:08:03| So somebody has some political leanings and it's not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11283)|
| 3:08:07| It might be Dr. Fauci.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11287)|
| 3:08:11| So this is just my two cents to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11291)|
| 3:08:15| Please put your egos aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11295)|
| 3:08:18| Do five minutes worth of your own research somewhere besides Facebook, Google, and the mainstream media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11298)|
| 3:08:26| and listen to the people you serve, children and parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11306)|
| 3:08:34| Now here comes the other verbal beating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11314)|
| 3:08:37| Parents, take action today and pull your children out of these schools until they start using common sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11317)|
| 3:08:45| and stop the nonsense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11325)|
| 3:08:48| This may require a lot of sacrifice on your parts, i.e. you may lose a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11328)|
| 3:08:54| You may have to co-op homeschooling and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11334)|
| 3:08:58| But these are your children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11338)|
| 3:09:01| This is your first priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11341)|
| 3:09:05| When a student body suddenly shrinks to almost nothing, you won't need a board of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11345)|
| 3:09:13| They'll be obsolete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11353)|
| 3:09:15| We can always push for more vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11355)|
| 3:09:18| Again, I don't have kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11358)|
| 3:09:20| This is just what I'm seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11360)|
| 3:09:22| We all, including myself, we all need to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11362)|
| 3:09:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11366)|
| 3:09:28| Thank you, Deborah Howard and then Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11368)|
| 3:09:35| If you will state your name and county of residence and you'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11375)|
| 3:09:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11378)|
| 3:09:39| Deborah Howard, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11379)|
| 3:09:41| I do want to tell you that I appreciate your thoughtful discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11381)|
| 3:09:45| It was reassuring to me that we can all discuss something that's this hotly debated and get along while we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11385)|
| 3:09:57| Our children need their voices to be heard, and I know we're doing a lot of that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11397)|
| 3:10:03| I have two teenagers in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11403)|
| 3:10:06| They've been in Knox County schools their entire educational life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11406)|
| 3:10:11| I have one that's going to graduate this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11411)|
| 3:10:16| She chose not to do band, which she loved to do, so she missed out on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11416)|
| 3:10:20| Fortunately, it doesn't look like they're going to miss out on things like prom and all of that, which I know the kids missed out on last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11420)|
| 3:10:27| My son missed a soccer season last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11427)|
| 3:10:30| He was depressed last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11430)|
| 3:10:32| I was excited when school went back, and I thought, well, hey, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11432)|
| 3:10:37| They're going to go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11437)|
| 3:10:38| We won't be in masks forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11438)|
| 3:10:43| I'm also a PA in Knox County, and I am seeing an ever-increasing number of teens and tweens that need referral for counseling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11443)|
| 3:10:53| and even needing medication for depression and anxiety, and that really breaks my heart because some of them are very young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11453)|
| 3:10:59| I can only imagine what that's doing to some of the babies out there, the really young ones, the kindergartners, the second-graders, the third-graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11459)|
| 3:11:09| I fear that we don't know the implications that all of this is going to have on them in the future and how they develop and how they form relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11469)|
| 3:11:18| You know, normal is normal, and wearing masks all the time is just not normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11478)|
| 3:11:26| I know it's hard to stand up against a policy that's already in place, even if it was from an emergency situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11486)|
| 3:11:34| You know, there's a lot of misinformation out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11494)|
| 3:11:37| I do hope everybody is doing their own research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11497)|
| 3:11:41| You know, the thing is there's an easy way out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11501)|
| 3:11:44| There's a very simple solution, and that is just make it optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11504)|
| 3:11:48| If a parent is fearful and they are afraid for their kid, they think their kid needs to wear a mask, you know, go ahead and wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11508)|
| 3:11:57| It works for both the wearer and those around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11517)|
| 3:12:00| The whole idea that two people have to wear a mask for it to be effective just is beyond me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11520)|
| 3:12:10| The vaccine is or should be available for all the teachers who choose to take it, and like we heard tonight, even the kids, which, you know, personally, that wouldn't be a choice I would make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11530)|
| 3:12:22| But, you know, that is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11542)|
| 3:12:25| You know, this really should be a non-issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11545)|
| 3:12:30| I wouldn't be asking for students and teachers to be forced to not wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11550)|
| 3:12:38| And students and teachers should not be forced to wear a mask, which is exactly what's happened this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11558)|
| 3:12:44| So, you know, others have been imposing their will on some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11564)|
| 3:12:50| You know, please stand up for our children, the ones that you've been elected to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11570)|
| 3:12:56| And, Mr. Superintendent, you know, be the leader that we know you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11576)|
| 3:13:03| Please let people look back and say, you know, that's how you lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11583)|
| 3:13:06| He said back in February we saw kind of an end to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11586)|
| 3:13:10| And then let it end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11590)|
| 3:13:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11593)|
| 3:13:15| Thank you, Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11595)|
| 3:13:18| And after Sherry is Lisa Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11598)|
| 3:13:20| If you would state your name and county of residence, and you have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11600)|

| 3:13:27| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11607)|
| 3:13:28| First off, I want to thank each and every one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11608)|
| 3:13:30| This is the first real conversation I have heard in many, many months between coming here and going to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11610)|
| 3:13:37| This is the first real conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11617)|
| 3:13:38| I was very, very, very encouraged by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11618)|
| 3:13:41| But I'll start out with, last month I brought to you some statistics from the German study that showed how masking children are harming children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11621)|
| 3:13:48| I'm going to repeat that study because some of you apparently didn't get the message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11628)|
| 3:13:51| At the University of Witten-Hardecke, an online registry had been set up where parents, doctors, pedagogues, and others can enter their observations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11631)|
| 3:13:59| On October 20, 2020, 363 doctors were asked to make entries and to make parents and teachers aware of the registry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11639)|
| 3:14:06| By October 26, only six days, the registry had been used by 20,353 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11646)|
| 3:14:14| In this publication, we report the results from the parents who entered data on a total of 25,930 children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11654)|
| 3:14:21| The average wearing time of the mask was 270 minutes per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11661)|
| 3:14:25| That's a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11665)|
| 3:14:28| Impairments caused by wearing the mask were reported by 68% of the parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11668)|
| 3:14:32| These included 60% irritability, 53% headaches, 50% difficulty concentrating, 49% less happiness, 44% reluctance to go to school, kindergarten, 42% malaise, 38% impaired learning, and 37% drowsiness or fatigue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11672)|
| 3:14:52| Studies have shown that children are not significant spreaders of COVID, nor are they adversely affected by this virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11692)|
| 3:14:58| Yet the mitigation efforts have been beyond anything I've seen in 30 years of nursing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11698)|
| 3:15:03| Mr. Thomas, you spoke in February about how you saw the light at the end of the tunnel and how this fall you could see us getting back to some normalcy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11703)|
| 3:15:10| Well, we need to get these kids back to complete normalcy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11710)|
| 3:15:13| We are taking their childhood away from him, and it's uncalled for and abusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11713)|
| 3:15:18| To this school board, you've been voted in to represent the parents and these kids, not the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11718)|
| 3:15:23| While I have immense respect for most of them and the jobs that they do, they have other representatives that can speak for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11723)|
| 3:15:28| Currently, we have successfully prevented a voucher system for homeschooling in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11728)|
| 3:15:35| But if you continue along this course, you will guarantee an army of advocates demanding a voucher system in the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11735)|
| 3:15:42| These kids have no one to speak for them but their parents and grandparents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11742)|
| 3:15:47| That's why we're asking you to speak for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11747)|
| 3:15:50| Because apparently, they don't have you speaking for them, at least some of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11750)|
| 3:15:55| Children have been feeling the effects of this viral reaction for the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11755)|
| 3:15:59| As you're well aware, mental health exacerbations in our children are on the rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11759)|
| 3:16:03| Whereas before COVID, 1 in 5 needed mental health professionals, now it's 4 in 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11763)|
| 3:16:07| Teen suicide and suicidal ideations are skyrocketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11767)|
| 3:16:11| We've already lost several in Knox County students to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11771)|
| 3:16:14| You have lost none to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11774)|
| 3:16:16| Ms. Owens said in a previous meeting that if we could just prevent one death, isn't it worth it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11776)|
| 3:16:21| Well, how many suicides or attempted suicides will be on your hands while you are trying to prevent COVID deaths?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11781)|
| 3:16:27| If we could just prevent one, wouldn't it be worth it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11787)|
| 3:16:31| Parents who are listening, if this school board refuses to stand up for your children, pull them out and homeschool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11791)|
| 3:16:37| Contact me at knox.tennesseestands.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11797)|
| 3:16:40| Even if you work full time, it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11800)|
| 3:16:42| We will help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11802)|
| 3:16:44| For this school board, if you're trying to move Knox County schools forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11804)|
| 3:16:48| then you have to consider what the future looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11808)|
| 3:16:51| Because that future is dictated by the consequences of the decisions that you make today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11811)|
| 3:16:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11816)|
| 3:16:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11818)|
| 3:17:00| Lisa Taylor and then Debra Stafford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11820)|
| 3:17:07| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11827)|
| 3:17:09| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11829)|
| 3:17:11| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11831)|
| 3:17:12| My name is Lisa Taylor and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11832)|
| 3:17:14| Much of what I was going to say, as some of the other speakers have already said, has been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11834)|
| 3:17:20| And so I appreciate that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11840)|
| 3:17:22| But I do want to add a few other things that we have not discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11842)|
| 3:17:26| I'm the proud parent of two Halls High School fine arts students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11846)|
| 3:17:30| My daughter, Samantha, came before you in November of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11850)|
| 3:17:34| And my son, Logan, just last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11854)|
| 3:17:38| I am here tonight requesting that you allow all KCS students the choice to be masked or unmasked for the coming school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11858)|
| 3:17:47| And, just as important, regardless of which choice they make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11867)|
| 3:17:51| all students be granted equal opportunities to participate in school-related functions with no exclusions or segregation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11871)|
| 3:17:59| In this very building tonight, there are masked persons seated in one area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11879)|
| 3:18:05| and unmasked persons in another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11885)|
| 3:18:07| We do not want this happening to our students in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11887)|
| 3:18:11| Superintendent Thomas, I do not envy your position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11891)|
| 3:18:14| That being said, and with all due respect, your statement to the board, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11894)|
| 3:18:19| my recommendation is that you consider approving the continuation of the existing board-approved guidelines, is baffling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11899)|
| 3:18:26| I would have asked more questions about that this evening, but I think you've addressed some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11906)|
| 3:18:32| But I still wonder about motivation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11912)|
| 3:18:34| If it is true that you are relying primarily on CDC information to drive the decision-making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11914)|
| 3:18:40| what is the point of the KCS COVID dashboard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11920)|
| 3:18:43| Is it irrelevant that the dashboard data, as of 4 p.m. today, reports that there are only 26 active students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11923)|
| 3:18:51| and 10 active staff cases for a grand total of 36 in the entire county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11931)|
| 3:18:56| Is the Knox County Health Department data now irrelevant as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11936)|
| 3:19:00| The data from KCHD reports that over the last 12 months, there have been only 28 COVID-related hospitalizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11940)|
| 3:19:07| and I will note, Dr. Childs that spoke earlier said there were some more than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11947)|
| 3:19:11| which isn't reflected in that data, I suppose, and there were zero deaths in the 0 to 17 age bracket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11951)|
| 3:19:17| Is it not worth noting that school staff and parents and grandparents and anyone else who wants the shot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11957)|
| 3:19:23| including students at least 16 and up, can have it before school begins if they have not already done so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11963)|
| 3:19:29| It has even been reported more than once that more Knox County residents have been vaccinated than have tested positive for the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11969)|
| 3:19:37| Students, families, teachers and staff in Knox County have complied with masking and restrictions for nearly the entire school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11977)|
| 3:19:45| and there are still no metrics to indicate when this will end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11985)|
| 3:19:48| Is it when there are less than 20 cases in students with red hair and freckles who bring their lunch to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11988)|
| 3:19:55| or when there are less than 5 cases in teachers who drive blue Toyotas and wear black shoes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=11995)|
| 3:20:00| What is the end point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12000)|
| 3:20:02| Because I cannot tell my own son, who spoke to you last month, when or if masking will end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12002)|
| 3:20:08| He is considering leaving his school to finish his final two years in an environment where he can do what he loves to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12008)|
| 3:20:15| sing freely without a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12015)|
| 3:20:18| There are KCS high school choir and band directors who expect drops in program numbers for the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12018)|
| 3:20:24| The feedback from incoming freshman families and older students is that they are opting out because of the mask requirements for singing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12024)|
| 3:20:31| and requirements for altering their band instruments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12031)|
| 3:20:34| Has anyone actually spoken to these teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12034)|
| 3:20:37| My concern is that you do not recognize that there are thousands of them in the system who want to speak out against masking and restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12037)|
| 3:20:44| but they feel they cannot do so for fear of retaliation by the teachers union or by KCS, namely their jobs threatened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12044)|
| 3:20:54| I cannot even begin to express how much this upsets me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12054)|
| 3:20:58| The voices of these teachers who have been in the trenches with our children day in and day out are being suppressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12058)|
| 3:21:04| when we need to hear from them the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12064)|
| 3:21:06| Here is what I cannot help but wonder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12066)|
| 3:21:10| Is this a time of weeding out the district by dismantling the system as it used to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12070)|
| 3:21:15| What do I mean by this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12075)|
| 3:21:17| Well, by allowing fine arts programs to wither and die, there will no longer be a need to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12077)|
| 3:21:23| By creating mandates and guidelines for in-person learning that will force families and students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12083)|
| 3:21:29| to choose either a virtual learning option through KCS or perhaps now as you said through the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12089)|
| 3:21:34| or other educational opportunities outside of public schools altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12094)|
| 3:21:38| All that to say fewer students to serve in person and fewer students to serve in the traditional system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12098)|
| 3:21:44| means fewer expenses, less overcrowding, all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12104)|
| 3:21:48| I'm beginning to wonder if this may even be God's plan, that we need to start from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12108)|
| 3:21:54| In Chapter 1 of the Tennessee School Board Candidate Guide, it states the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12114)|
| 3:21:58| A school board's primary duty is to provide the opportunity for the best and most appropriate education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12118)|
| 3:22:03| for the children entrusted in its care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12123)|
| 3:22:05| Please focus on education and not masking. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12125)|
| 3:22:10| Thank you. Deborah Stafford and Teresa Nicely after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12130)|
| 3:22:18| If you will just state your name and county of residence, then you'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12138)|
| 3:22:22| Hi, I'm Deborah Stafford and I'm in Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12142)|

| 3:22:32| My mind is kind of swirling right now after listening to your very wonderful conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12152)|
| 3:22:37| And I thank all of you, even those of you that I might disagree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12157)|
| 3:22:40| I think you had a very meaningful dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12160)|

| 3:22:49| My youngest one was the class of 2020 and denied her graduation because of the COVID reaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12169)|
| 3:22:55| I say reaction because I feel like it was a travesty that my daughter was denied her graduation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12175)|
| 3:23:01| because we did not have the opportunity to choose her family to attend her graduation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12181)|
| 3:23:05| with only being given four tickets and the ridiculous standards that we were given at Powell High School Stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12185)|
| 3:23:12| for our very large extended family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12192)|
| 3:23:15| So I prepared some things, but again, my head's kind of swirling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12195)|
| 3:23:19| So among some of the things that you said, Dr. Buchanan mentioned the 42,000 cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12199)|
| 3:23:26| that we know we have had out of our county of 470,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12206)|
| 3:23:30| She also mentioned that we have had multiple cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12210)|
| 3:23:33| Some people have had COVID more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12213)|
| 3:23:35| I know this to be true because I know some of the people at Knox County Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12215)|
| 3:23:39| and they have told me this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12219)|
| 3:23:40| What no one seems to be able to tell us, including Dr. Buchanan earlier tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12220)|
| 3:23:44| is how many of those has it happened to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12224)|
| 3:23:47| Have five people had COVID more than once?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12227)|
| 3:23:50| Ten people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12230)|
| 3:23:51| Twenty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12231)|
| 3:23:52| You know, being scientifically minded, if we don't have a number or a figure, it's just innuendo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12232)|
| 3:23:59| It's not science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12239)|
| 3:24:01| We all know flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12241)|
| 3:24:02| Some of us get flu every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12242)|
| 3:24:04| Some of us never get the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12244)|
| 3:24:06| So it stands to reason that it is possible, but without that data, we cannot make a logical decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12246)|
| 3:24:13| Teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12253)|
| 3:24:14| I think our teachers are among some of the most wonderful in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12254)|
| 3:24:18| If I had my way and the money, I would give everyone a 100% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12258)|
| 3:24:22| They do not make their value in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12262)|
| 3:24:26| I also know as a former Humira nurse educator in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12266)|
| 3:24:29| Humira is a medication given to people with autoimmune conditions such as Crohn's disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12269)|
| 3:24:35| that we have far more teachers in our county that have autoimmune conditions than I realized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12275)|
| 3:24:40| Autoimmune conditions can be very deadly when you are taking immune suppressing agents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12280)|
| 3:24:46| I certainly understand why some teachers would be very concerned about being exposed to COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12286)|
| 3:24:51| and I do not want to dismiss those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12291)|
| 3:24:54| I also understand as a nurse practitioner and someone that has my own health disparities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12294)|
| 3:24:59| sometimes we have to make the unfortunate decision that we cannot continue in a profession that puts our own bodies at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12299)|
| 3:25:07| I don't say that flippantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12307)|
| 3:25:09| I don't say that to belittle the very wonderful job that these teachers do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12309)|
| 3:25:13| But unfortunately, if we're having to make a choice to create so much of a health care disparity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12313)|
| 3:25:19| for teachers who prior to a year ago were exposed to thousands of potentially deadly pathogens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12319)|
| 3:25:26| who now think they're going to die over the addition of one pathogen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12326)|
| 3:25:30| we need to have this conversation and this dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12330)|
| 3:25:34| In this county, the poor single families are the greatest disparity from what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12334)|
| 3:25:40| They don't always have the choice to homeschool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12340)|
| 3:25:43| They are depending on you all to send their children to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12343)|
| 3:25:47| We have heard and heard and heard about the mental health catastrophe that's happening to our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12347)|
| 3:25:54| The thing is, if we end masks tomorrow, which I wholeheartedly support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12354)|
| 3:25:59| because masks are doing nothing to prevent COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12359)|
| 3:26:03| but they're doing a whole lot to cause brother against brother and neighbor against neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12363)|
| 3:26:08| and school board member against school board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12368)|
| 3:26:11| we are not undoing what we have done to our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12371)|
| 3:26:14| And I would encourage all of you to start thinking about how you're going to undo what you all have done to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12374)|
| 3:26:19| And I don't mean you all singularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12379)|
| 3:26:22| We've all collectively participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12382)|
| 3:26:25| But these children, I don't know how much you all know about epigenetics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12385)|
| 3:26:28| and I know I have less than a minute, but we all have genes in our body that when we undergo stress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12388)|
| 3:26:35| we can undergo epigenetic changes that put us in a chronic state of stress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12395)|
| 3:26:42| Childhood trauma, it can last us a lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12402)|
| 3:26:46| And we are creating lifetime stress and trauma in some of these children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12406)|
| 3:26:51| that have no choice except the choice that you all make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12411)|
| 3:26:56| And we can say, let's make masks a choice, and that's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12416)|
| 3:26:59| And I wholeheartedly support masking a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12419)|
| 3:27:02| But what are you going to do in the fall when you have your masks versus your non-mask gangs out on the playground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12422)|
| 3:27:08| And we're not going to play with her because her mommy doesn't make her mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12428)|
| 3:27:11| and we can't play with them because they mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12431)|
| 3:27:14| Finally, it's Autism Awareness Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12434)|
| 3:27:17| One in 30 children now have autism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12437)|
| 3:27:19| I have a 21-year-old with autism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12439)|
| 3:27:21| I cannot find people to assess and diagnose children with autism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12441)|
| 3:27:25| It is ridiculous to expect children at risk for autism to get a phone call diagnosis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12445)|
| 3:27:30| or a phone call speech pathology assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12450)|
| 3:27:33| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12453)|
| 3:27:35| Teresa Nicely and then Elizabeth Wagner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12455)|
| 3:27:40| Hello, my name is Teresa Nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12460)|
| 3:27:42| I'm a Knox County resident, and I'm not a public speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12462)|
| 3:27:45| But thank you for allowing me to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12465)|
| 3:27:47| I'm a mother of two children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12467)|
| 3:27:49| I'm a Christian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12469)|
| 3:27:50| I have been a health care worker for 23 years with almost 11 of those being in a hospital setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12470)|
| 3:27:55| I'm here not for myself but for the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12475)|
| 3:27:58| I would like to ask you to get rid of the masks and the contact tracing in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12478)|
| 3:28:03| It is my understanding that 24,000 children in Knox County have been quarantined during the school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12483)|
| 3:28:09| due to contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12489)|
| 3:28:11| Of those, only 2,500 tested positive for the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12491)|
| 3:28:14| Many of those quarantined had to do so three to four times and never got sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12494)|
| 3:28:19| but yet missed out on in-school learning for six to eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12499)|
| 3:28:23| The numbers simply do not support continuing this contact tracing with our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12503)|
| 3:28:28| Many of these kids quarantined due to contact tracing have learning disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12508)|
| 3:28:32| or need extra help with classes that their parents are unable to give,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12512)|
| 3:28:36| and they can't get the help they need virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12516)|
| 3:28:39| Parents and family members tell me they are concerned about their kids getting behind because of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12519)|
| 3:28:44| They also tell me it's been hard when they work full time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12524)|
| 3:28:46| and aren't able to stay home with their children who are not sick but get forced to stay home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12526)|
| 3:28:52| I hear you guys only want to hear what the CDC or health department have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12532)|
| 3:28:56| There are lots of studies now that say asymptomatic people are not spreading this virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12536)|
| 3:29:01| Also on March 5th, the CDC published a report admitting that face masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12541)|
| 3:29:06| do not provide protection against the COVID-19 virus and potentially worsen infection risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12546)|
| 3:29:12| It goes on to say, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12552)|
| 3:29:14| authored by more than a dozen medical doctors, Ph.D. researchers, and attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12554)|
| 3:29:20| that research found that wearing a mask or not wearing a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12560)|
| 3:29:24| produces roughly the same outcome in terms of the number of cases and deaths to blame on this COVID-19 virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12564)|
| 3:29:30| What has bothered me the most about all of this is the fact that no one seems to want to look at any real studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12570)|
| 3:29:36| that prove vitamin D, zinc, and vitamin C are key to not having severe symptoms with the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12576)|
| 3:29:42| Why is no one wanting to work on educating others about getting healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12582)|
| 3:29:46| and making sure you have enough of these vitamins in your system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12586)|
| 3:29:49| to keep your immune system well enough to fight the virus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12589)|
| 3:29:53| If you have a strong immune system, then you are more likely to have mild symptoms if you catch the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12593)|
| 3:29:58| The worst thing these so-called health experts did was encourage everyone to stay in their houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12598)|
| 3:30:03| and not get out for some natural vitamin D and fresh air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12603)|
| 3:30:07| Masks are not meant to be worn all day long for hours at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12607)|
| 3:30:11| Surgeons, who up until last year were the only ones I knew of who would wear them for several hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12611)|
| 3:30:16| only did so to prevent bacterial spreading into the surgical sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12616)|
| 3:30:21| Surgeons change them frequently and are taught how to properly take the masks on and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12621)|
| 3:30:26| Of all the years of being in health care, I never put a mask on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12626)|
| 3:30:30| unless in direct contact with someone who had the flu or TB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12630)|
| 3:30:34| When that happened, I wore an N95 mask, and I only wore them for short periods of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12634)|
| 3:30:39| since they are very difficult to breathe in when they fit properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12639)|
| 3:30:43| In order for an N95 mask to work properly, it has to be fit-tested to your face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12643)|
| 3:30:48| A specially trained person teaches you how to properly put on the mask and take it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12648)|
| 3:30:53| Then that person places a hood over your head and sprays something inside, such as saccharin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12653)|
| 3:30:58| I was fit-tested two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12658)|
| 3:31:01| It took four different N95 masks before I did not taste the saccharin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12661)|
| 3:31:07| which means none of those N95 masks fit me properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12667)|
| 3:31:11| You can visually see saccharin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12671)|

| 3:31:20| If that saccharin was able to get through four different N95 masks on me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12680)|
| 3:31:25| how do you expect these cloth masks or even surgical masks to block that virus that we can't see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12685)|
| 3:31:31| These masks everyone loves so much is just a visual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12691)|
| 3:31:36| but long-term damage and effects are yet to be seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12696)|
| 3:31:40| Kids are complaining of increased headaches, increased drowsiness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12700)|
| 3:31:44| and there is a real concern of even increased teeth and gum decay from wearing these masks all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12704)|
| 3:31:49| We already know of the psychological problems because of the increased suicide rates and drug use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12709)|
| 3:31:54| I feel this is borderline child abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12714)|
| 3:31:57| Are you willing to take responsibility for the effects of this mask wearing on our children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12717)|
| 3:32:02| Are you willing to cover the medical costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12722)|
| 3:32:05| You guys are here for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12725)|
| 3:32:07| I pray that you help free our children from all these masks and the contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12727)|
| 3:32:12| One thing I know from all of my medical training is that viruses do what they will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12732)|
| 3:32:17| If you look at graphs of all countries, cities, counties, and school systems that require masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12737)|
| 3:32:23| and compare them to those that do not require masks, you will find the exact same bell curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12743)|
| 3:32:28| Numbers are almost identical because you cannot control a virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12748)|
| 3:32:33| Please do the right thing by our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12753)|
| 3:32:36| I'm a very proud American, but I'm so tired of seeing our freedoms being stripped away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12756)|

| 3:32:45| Elizabeth Wagner and then Addison Wagner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12765)|
| 3:32:54| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12774)|
| 3:32:56| Yes, ma'am. I'm Elizabeth Wagner and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12776)|
| 3:32:59| I have four children in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12779)|
| 3:33:01| We are strong proponents of our schools and have had many amazing teachers in the five years that we have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12781)|
| 3:33:06| Thank you so much for the conversation that you started tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12786)|
| 3:33:09| It's not over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12789)|
| 3:33:11| At this point, the entire board, as well as the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12791)|
| 3:33:14| have seen many emails with statistics and numbers and statements from medical doctors about the detrimental use of masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12794)|
| 3:33:19| Last time I spoke about risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12799)|
| 3:33:21| This time, I'm going to be using some of your own statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12801)|
| 3:33:24| In Superintendent Thomas's application for superintendent dated January 13, 2017, he stated, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12804)|
| 3:33:30| I believe that leadership is participatory, collaborative, and situational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12810)|
| 3:33:34| Throughout my career, I have shown that I'm a good listener who is willing to consider and have compassion for others with differing views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12814)|
| 3:33:40| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12820)|
| 3:33:42| And I hope tonight that you really do listen to others' viewpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12822)|
| 3:33:45| I hope you understand the discrimination that masks impose upon our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12825)|
| 3:33:50| You also state, I believe that if we are further to improve upon our successes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12830)|
| 3:33:54| every school must have well-defined achievement goals that are adhered to and continuously measured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12834)|
| 3:33:59| I'd like to contrast that statement with these facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12839)|
| 3:34:02| In no way, shape, or form has there ever been goals with these mask requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12842)|
| 3:34:06| No statement citing when we have this many people vaccinated or when we have a certain number of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12846)|
| 3:34:10| And until tonight, it wasn't even a conversation that we were having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12850)|
| 3:34:15| These mandates and requirements of using a medical device on our students are merely put into place with no end in sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12855)|
| 3:34:21| On the Knox County Schools COVID dashboard, as of yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12861)|
| 3:34:24| we sit at green in every category except for custodial support and substitute availability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12864)|
| 3:34:29| which I am informed were issues pre-pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12869)|
| 3:34:32| Not to mention that at the February 10th board meeting, you stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12872)|
| 3:34:35| I see the light at the end of the tunnel with this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12875)|
| 3:34:38| With the vaccination, I'm very optimistic that we can hopefully be back to some sense of normalcy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12878)|
| 3:34:43| What has changed between then and now, other than a slew of teachers being vaccinated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12883)|
| 3:34:49| I don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12889)|
| 3:34:51| Out of the 60,854 students enrolled in Knox County Schools, we have a mere 23 active cases as of yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12891)|
| 3:34:58| To put that into perspective, that is 0.037% of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12898)|
| 3:35:02| And out of the over 7,900 staff, which I may be skewed on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12902)|
| 3:35:07| members of the Knox County Schools staff members, there are currently eight active cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12907)|
| 3:35:12| which in those numbers translates to 0.1% of the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12912)|
| 3:35:15| The numbers that you used to demand the masks aren't there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12915)|
| 3:35:19| I don't think there was ever a reason to require them, but certainly not currently, and especially not for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12919)|
| 3:35:25| The vaccine is currently available to every person over 16 that would like to receive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12925)|
| 3:35:29| For those staff and students that desire the vaccine, there's nothing standing in the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12929)|
| 3:35:34| I entrust my children to Knox County Schools for one simple reason, to educate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12934)|
| 3:35:39| Not to treat them for medical issues, not to help them grow healthy and strong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12939)|
| 3:35:42| not to feed them or clothe them or even make sure they're well-rounded individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12942)|
| 3:35:46| Those things are my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12946)|
| 3:35:48| I simply send them for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12948)|
| 3:35:50| I send them to be taught algebra and reading comprehension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12950)|
| 3:35:52| I send them to learn how to write papers and to analyze data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12952)|
| 3:35:55| This is Knox County Schools' purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12955)|
| 3:35:58| If I wanted a medical opinion or intervention, I would not call this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12958)|
| 3:36:02| If my child was sick, I would not seek out advice from any school board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12962)|
| 3:36:05| no matter how well-meaning each of you may be, and I actually like a lot of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12965)|
| 3:36:10| I would go to my doctor, and I would discuss the issue as well as treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12970)|
| 3:36:13| A face mask, according to the FDA, is considered a medical device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12973)|
| 3:36:18| As such, I don't believe it is this board's concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12978)|
| 3:36:20| or even right to require our children to wear a medical device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12980)|
| 3:36:23| I'm going to read the mission statement for this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12983)|
| 3:36:26| The Knox County Board of Education's mission is to provide excellent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12986)|
| 3:36:29| and accessible learning opportunities that empower all students to realize their full potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12989)|
| 3:36:34| It's your mission to provide excellent and accessible learning opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12994)|
| 3:36:39| I don't believe that Knox County has provided that this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=12999)|
| 3:36:42| My children are receiving subpar education, and I believe it is directly related to the masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13002)|
| 3:36:47| There's a greater emphasis placed on wearing masks than in turning in papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13007)|
| 3:36:51| There's a greater emphasis on keeping your mask on in the classroom than keeping hydrated during class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13011)|
| 3:36:56| It seems to me like we're skewing the purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13016)|
| 3:36:59| Your mission is to empower all students to realize their full potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13019)|
| 3:37:02| Once again, I feel Knox County has fallen short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13022)|
| 3:37:05| Just speaking about one of my children, my four children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13025)|
| 3:37:08| who will be speaking to you tonight about her experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13028)|
| 3:37:10| she has not been empowered to reach her potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13030)|
| 3:37:12| She's a wonderful student who works hard and has never been in trouble since coming to Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13032)|
| 3:37:16| She is interested in getting an education, yet she is handicapped by the constant attention that is put on masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13036)|
| 3:37:22| She is handicapped by not being able to sing in the chorus class she signed up for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13042)|
| 3:37:26| despite many measures taken to make the classroom, quote, safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13046)|
| 3:37:30| She is handicapped by the requirement to wear a face mask for over eight hours a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13050)|
| 3:37:35| a requirement that is not equal to her teachers, her principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13055)|
| 3:37:38| or any of Knox County school staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13058)|
| 3:37:40| She is being failed by this school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13060)|
| 3:37:43| Please, I implore you, I beg you, please stop discriminating against my children and make the masking optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13063)|
| 3:37:50| I'd also like to add, why are we being discriminated against tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13070)|
| 3:37:54| Why are we separated from the meeting and not given fair and equal access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13074)|
| 3:37:58| Why can't we have the exact same live feed as everybody else in that room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13078)|
| 3:38:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13082)|
| 3:38:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13083)|
| 3:38:04| This is my daughter, Addison, and I'm going to stand here with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13084)|
| 3:38:06| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13086)|
| 3:38:08| If you will just state your name and county of residence and you'll have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13088)|
| 3:38:12| Hi, I'm Addison Wagner, and I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13092)|
| 3:38:16| I'm in seventh grade and in all honors classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13096)|
| 3:38:18| Up until January, I've loved my school and had no problems with the students, teachers, or staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13098)|
| 3:38:23| I felt respected and cared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13103)|
| 3:38:25| I felt safe at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13105)|
| 3:38:28| That day, I had gone to school and treated it like any other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13108)|
| 3:38:31| I had my Chromebook, my backpack, and my mask all ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13111)|
| 3:38:34| Every day since we had returned from winter break, I had worn a mesh mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13114)|
| 3:38:37| Instead of struggling to breathe, I was able to breathe during my classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13117)|
| 3:38:40| At this point, I had worn a mesh mask to school for two weeks and had no one say anything to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13120)|
| 3:38:45| In first period, my teacher told me to change my mask because it was mesh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13125)|
| 3:38:51| I told her that I had been struggling to breathe in the other two layer masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13131)|
| 3:38:55| She then told me to change my mask and offered me a disposable one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13135)|
| 3:39:00| I want the school board to understand that I was not told that this was against the school policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13140)|
| 3:39:05| and that each teacher would have different ways of dealing with the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13145)|
| 3:39:09| Since it was getting hard to breathe after first period, I decided to put the mesh mask back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13149)|
| 3:39:13| As I was sitting in second period, the vice principal called my name and told me to come with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13153)|
| 3:39:19| At that point, I was worried that I might be quarantined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13159)|
| 3:39:22| or there was some minor thing about one of my honors classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13162)|
| 3:39:27| but I had no idea what lay ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13167)|
| 3:39:30| He took me away and walked with me in the hallway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13170)|
| 3:39:34| He told me that my mask was not acceptable in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13174)|
| 3:39:37| I dared to ask him why before I thought of the consequences of that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13177)|
| 3:39:42| He then started yelling at me in the hallway for something as simple as a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13182)|
| 3:39:46| He then took me to the office and told me to sit down in a chair as he walked away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13186)|
| 3:39:53| At that point, I was crying because the assistant principal had yelled in my face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13193)|
| 3:39:57| I was shocked to see a lady was handing me a tissue and telling me that I could take off my mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13197)|
| 3:40:02| She told me that I could take off the very thing that had gotten me yelled at, and I gladly did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13202)|
| 3:40:07| The nurse then came out and told me to come to her office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13207)|
| 3:40:12| When we sat, she continued to reprimand me for wearing the mesh mask, and I politely asked why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13212)|
| 3:40:17| Then she went on her computer and pulled up a random site that said mask guidelines are to wear two layered masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13217)|
| 3:40:24| I have since read the Knox County Schools guidelines, and it says, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13224)|
| 3:40:30| mask or face covering, and also, quote, must cover the mouth and nose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13230)|
| 3:40:36| There are no other requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13236)|
| 3:40:39| Instead of sending me back to class, she put me in a room by myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13239)|
| 3:40:43| I had no idea what was going to happen, which terrified me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13243)|
| 3:40:46| She kept me in that room for almost two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13246)|
| 3:40:49| In that time, she came in and had me put my mask in a Ziploc bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13249)|
| 3:40:53| Then she took it out of the room and came back with it five minutes later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13253)|
| 3:40:57| I have no idea what she did with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13257)|
| 3:41:00| Later, the nurse had me call my mom, and she came in and picked me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13260)|
| 3:41:05| My every day is filled with fear, anxiety, and vulnerability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13265)|
| 3:41:10| My new normal is stress and fear because every time that I see the assistant principal or nurse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13270)|
| 3:41:15| I am reminded that I can be returned to that very room at any time, back into that pit of uncertainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13275)|
| 3:41:22| Putting on a mask at school means that I have to live in that pit, day in and day out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13282)|
| 3:41:27| Would you want to live in that pit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13287)|
| 3:41:29| A pit of uncertainty, fear, anxiety, and vulnerability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13289)|
| 3:41:33| Putting on a mask means that I have no choice in how I perceive the world around me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13293)|
| 3:41:38| Putting on a mask means I have no choice in determining what is right for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13298)|
| 3:41:43| The students are required to wear their masks for eight plus hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13303)|
| 3:41:48| Are the principals wearing their masks the entire time that they are in the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13308)|
| 3:41:52| Are the teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13312)|
| 3:41:53| Or are they allowed to remove their masks during various parts of the day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13313)|
| 3:41:57| I am not advocating for the teachers to be forced to wear a mask eight hours a day, as I know how hard that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13317)|
| 3:42:03| What I am saying is if you don't think that it is necessary for staff to wear them all day long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13323)|
| 3:42:08| why do you think it's okay for students to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13328)|
| 3:42:11| Why are you holding the students to a higher standard than the staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13331)|
| 3:42:15| Why are you discriminating against the students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13335)|
| 3:42:18| There has been more emphasis on the correction of masks than educating children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13338)|
| 3:42:23| Why was there such an extreme reaction to my mask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13343)|
| 3:42:27| Why was I forced to endure two hours of terror?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13347)|
| 3:42:32| Why was my mask more important than my education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13352)|
| 3:42:36| I want the choice to wear a mask or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13356)|
| 3:42:39| To live in that pit or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13359)|
| 3:42:41| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13361)|
| 3:42:43| Thank you, Edna Gibson and Andy Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13363)|
| 3:43:01| My name is Edna Gibson and I'm a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13381)|
| 3:43:10| I am asking that you consider to continue requiring masks until a vaccine is available for all Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13390)|
| 3:43:22| I am a parent of three Knox County students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13402)|
| 3:43:27| This past year I chose to not work and stay home so that they could be virtual, which had its own challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13407)|
| 3:43:40| I watched how the schools handled the safety of the students and slowly over time made the decision that it was safe for my children to return this coming school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13420)|
| 3:43:54| Then I heard that masks might be taken away and that is very problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13434)|
| 3:44:02| One answer has been that I just continue to keep them home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13442)|
| 3:44:07| As you can imagine, that has put a financial strain on our family, but we keep talking about mental health and all the issues with children and mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13447)|
| 3:44:21| Nobody is actually linking any of those studies to mask wearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13461)|
| 3:44:25| Obviously there are some mental health issues, but the only expert that talked about it said that they were directly linked to isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13465)|
| 3:44:33| If we are going to talk about mental health, let's talk about those virtual kids who have been waiting on it to be safe enough to return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13473)|
| 3:44:41| Now, even if I wanted to continue keeping them home, we are being told that virtual isn't going to be an option for the majority of those families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13481)|
| 3:44:50| I'm not asking that it be continued forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13490)|
| 3:44:54| People keep saying, when is the end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13494)|
| 3:44:57| When I have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13497)|
| 3:45:00| I don't like asking other people to help me protect my children, especially strangers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13500)|
| 3:45:06| That's a very odd thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13506)|
| 3:45:08| If I could do it by myself by having them vaccinated, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13508)|
| 3:45:12| Several people have pointed out that masks are not completely effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13512)|
| 3:45:18| No, of course they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13518)|
| 3:45:19| That's why it's so critical that all of us wear them, not just my child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13519)|
| 3:45:24| Masks are actually more effective at keeping the virus inside the mask than they are keeping it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13524)|
| 3:45:33| So when an infected person isn't wearing a mask and spreads those droplets, they shrink and evaporate and they're easier to get into my child's mask and infect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13533)|
| 3:45:46| So it's so important for their health and safety that they're not the only ones wearing it, that everyone around them is wearing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13546)|
| 3:45:55| We keep talking about the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13555)|
| 3:45:57| I'm happily going to get them all vaccinated as soon as I'm able, but I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13557)|
| 3:46:02| And since vaccines are optional, I have no way of knowing if their teacher is, if their surrounding students' parents are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13562)|
| 3:46:09| I have no idea what those daily habits are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13569)|
| 3:46:12| So again, people keep suggesting I stay home or keep them home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13572)|
| 3:46:17| Perhaps that's, I would like to point out, that's a great place for people who don't want to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13577)|
| 3:46:23| You don't have to wear a mask at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13583)|
| 3:46:25| So perhaps if you want your child to go maskless, you could take a turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13585)|
| 3:46:32| I really, I've skipped a lot of the points because so many people touched on them during the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13592)|
| 3:46:40| Again, I really don't like asking for help protecting my child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13600)|
| 3:46:44| If I thought it was enough for them to wear the mask, I wouldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13604)|
| 3:46:48| I'm asking for everyone else's help in making sure that there's not a disparity in education for my children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13608)|
| 3:46:54| so that they're able to come to a safe school and get the same education that other students are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13614)|
| 3:47:02| So I'm skipping over a lot of those points, but I just want to urge our entire community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13622)|
| 3:47:10| I've heard a lot of very rude comments from parents, and I just want to remind everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13630)|
| 3:47:18| I'm not just thinking about my own children, I'm thinking about all the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13638)|
| 3:47:22| And I'm asking, obviously the board does that every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13642)|
| 3:47:27| I'm asking that other parents do that as well as we have this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13647)|
| 3:47:30| It cannot just be about your children, it has to be about what's best collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13650)|
| 3:47:36| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13656)|
| 3:47:40| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13660)|
| 3:47:42| Andy Fox, and then Sarah Wilson after Andy Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13662)|
| 3:47:46| Good evening, my comments are directed to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13666)|
| 3:47:57| If you'll state your name and county of residence, sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13677)|
| 3:48:00| My name is Andy Fox, and I'm a resident of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13680)|
| 3:48:05| and as I was getting ready to say, my comments are directed as much to my friend and fellow law school alum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13685)|
| 3:48:10| Gary Dupler, as they are to the people on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13690)|
| 3:48:14| But I did, in preparation for my comments today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13694)|
| 3:48:19| I looked up the infection fatality rate of children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13699)|
| 3:48:24| because those are the primary occupants of the buildings in Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13704)|
| 3:48:29| and I checked the CDC website, and it says that for children 0-17 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13709)|
| 3:48:36| the infection fatality rate is 20 deaths per 1 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13716)|
| 3:48:41| and that equals 0.002%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13721)|
| 3:48:43| Of course, that's far less than the infection fatality rate of the flu,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13723)|
| 3:48:48| which is generally pegged at around 0.1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13728)|
| 3:48:51| So this virus poses very, very little risk to children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13731)|
| 3:48:57| and as we know also that children are not a vector of spread of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13737)|
| 3:49:02| because asymptomatic people, people who are not highly affected by the virus, don't pass it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13742)|
| 3:49:09| In fact, it was Dr. Fauci himself who said in early 2020 that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13749)|
| 3:49:13| asymptomatic spread has never been a driver of pandemics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13753)|
| 3:49:18| It's people with symptoms, but children don't have, very few children have symptoms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13758)|
| 3:49:23| and if they do, you can recognize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13763)|
| 3:49:25| The whole purpose of masks was to prevent asymptomatic spread, and we now know that doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13765)|
| 3:49:31| And for that reason, I don't believe that a governmental regulation can consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13771)|
| 3:49:39| or can continue to be considered as narrowly tailored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13779)|
| 3:49:45| and past the threshold of strict scrutiny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13785)|
| 3:49:50| and that could be a concern of yours if there is a Section 1983 lawsuit filed against the Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13790)|
| 3:49:59| And that may be something that's happening soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13799)|
| 3:50:02| and if it happens by virtue of me filing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13802)|
| 3:50:05| it certainly will not have been my first go-around with the Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13805)|
| 3:50:11| You may recall, if you've been on the board long enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13811)|
| 3:50:13| that I recruited Freedom X to come into town in 2014| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13813)|
| 3:50:16| when Superintendent McIntyre committed viewpoint discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13816)|
| 3:50:20| And I read about it in the newspaper, and I called my friend Bill Becker and had him come into town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13820)|
| 3:50:26| and we filed a lawsuit, and the Knox County school system had to admit that it did something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13826)|
| 3:50:31| But, you know, that's not the way to govern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13831)|
| 3:50:35| It's my position that government officials ought to draw back voluntarily from government regulations that may cross the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13835)|
| 3:50:45| You know, I've heard that, I've heard some people say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13845)|
| 3:50:50| well, you know, until a court tells me I can't do it, then it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13850)|
| 3:50:53| Well, that's just, that's not how government officials should conduct themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13853)|
| 3:50:57| because then sometimes you get sued, and it's embarrassing, and it costs the county money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13857)|
| 3:51:03| So, you know, my hope is that no one on this school board would continue to engage in a regulation that might result in crossing the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13863)|
| 3:51:13| And I did want to point something, along those lines, I wanted to point out something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13873)|
| 3:51:18| This has not been discussed much when it comes to the mask mandates that have been all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13878)|
| 3:51:27| But, you know, the FDA made an emergency use authorization for the use of masks as source control and a medical device to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13887)|
| 3:51:39| Cloth masks, for instance, were not approved as medical devices, as non-pharmaceutical interventions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13899)|
| 3:51:46| They were, you know, but the FDA made this emergency use authorization that the CDC then relied upon in recommending the use of masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13906)|
| 3:51:56| And then, of course, the school board relied upon the CDC to implement a mandate forcing children to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13916)|
| 3:52:04| Well, if you look at the U.S. Code, at the law, the statute that discusses emergency use authorization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13924)|
| 3:52:12| in 21 U.S.C. section 360 BBB-3, it says that any time a medical device is given emergency use authorization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13932)|
| 3:52:28| the person upon whom it may be administered is supposed to be given the option to accept or refuse administration of the product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13948)|
| 3:52:38| In other words, it can't be forced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13958)|
| 3:52:40| Now, I'm still researching that, and I'll just be candid with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13960)|
| 3:52:43| I'm not certain to the extent to which this could lead to culpability, but at least you know that it's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13963)|
| 3:52:52| And I would encourage you to discuss this matter with your counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13972)|
| 3:52:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13977)|
| 3:52:59| Sarah Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13979)|
| 3:53:10| Hello, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13990)|
| 3:53:11| My name is Sarah Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13991)|
| 3:53:12| I'm a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13992)|
| 3:53:15| First, I just want to thank every one of you for the conversation that you had earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=13995)|
| 3:53:20| It really was the first time that I have felt a little optimistic that you guys are hearing us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14000)|
| 3:53:26| that you care what our opinions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14006)|
| 3:53:29| So I just want to thank you for the meaningful dialogue that took place earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14009)|
| 3:53:33| So I'm coming to you to voice concerns over masking and contact tracing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14013)|
| 3:53:39| and I wanted to share with you an experience that my child had last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14019)|
| 3:53:43| Just last week, my daughter came home from school and was distraught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14023)|
| 3:53:47| She began to tell me how she had been bullied by another student at her school over the type of mask that she was wearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14027)|
| 3:53:55| It was not a mesh mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14035)|
| 3:53:56| Over the type of mask that she was wearing, it met every one of KCS's guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14036)|
| 3:54:02| She was bullied over this mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14042)|
| 3:54:04| Her mask 100% complied with the guidelines, but that was not good enough for this kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14044)|
| 3:54:09| He bullied and berated her, and he even convinced other students to join in with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14049)|
| 3:54:14| There were kids who disagreed with him, but of course, in true peer pressure style, they did not speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14054)|
| 3:54:20| She sat at her high school being humiliated and taunted for not wearing what this student thought was good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14060)|
| 3:54:27| We are teaching our kids to feel entitled to think that they are better and more virtuous than other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14067)|
| 3:54:34| and they are bold about screaming it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14074)|
| 3:54:37| What are we doing to this generation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14077)|
| 3:54:39| And this isn't in what I had written up, but just as we were sitting out in this room over here masked and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14079)|
| 3:54:45| someone that is not in this room right here called someone out there or texted someone out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14085)|
| 3:54:51| to have the police come and separate me and my friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14091)|
| 3:54:55| They wanted to control how closely we were sitting together, me and my friends that I walked in this building with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14095)|
| 3:55:02| So that tells you a little bit about how this has gotten into our psyche and what it's doing to our generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14102)|
| 3:55:10| Governor Lee said in a very publicized campaign, until there's a vaccine, we wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14110)|
| 3:55:15| I didn't personally agree with that statement, but at least there was a goalpost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14115)|
| 3:55:19| And Superintendent Thomas said in February that the vaccine is here, there's a light at the end of the tunnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14119)|
| 3:55:25| we're hoping for more of a normal year in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14125)|
| 3:55:28| So fast forward, and the vaccine's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14128)|
| 3:55:31| There was a goal and a glimmer of light at the end of this long, dark tunnel of restrictions that you have thrust us down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14131)|
| 3:55:38| So why is it being recommended, why is it even being considering that nothing changed for next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14138)|
| 3:55:44| If these recommendations stand, then there is no end game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14144)|
| 3:55:50| So if this is the case, they are sentenced, our children are sentenced to a lifetime of faceless solitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14150)|
| 3:55:55| with no hope that anything will ever be normal again due to your oppression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14155)|
| 3:55:59| We think, we have mental problems now, I shiver to think of the mental state of our children and families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14159)|
| 3:56:04| after another year of this senseless COVID prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14164)|
| 3:56:07| So, last week I called and asked a few of you, what is the research, that time goes so fast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14167)|
| 3:56:15| what is the research that the board is using to prove that masks are safe for our children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14175)|
| 3:56:21| And the ones of you that I spoke to said there is no research to show that masks are safe for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14181)|
| 3:56:28| There's no research on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14188)|
| 3:56:30| So, let me put it to you in another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14190)|
| 3:56:35| There is no research to prove that long-term masking isn't slowly killing our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14195)|
| 3:56:40| And I know that's a strong statement, but it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14200)|
| 3:56:42| 50 to 60 years ago, we were told by all the experts that smoking is safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14202)|
| 3:56:47| Science proves it causes no harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14207)|
| 3:56:50| I had a bunch of ads to show you guys, but I'm just going to show you one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14210)|
| 3:56:52| This is from 50, 60 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14212)|
| 3:56:54| It says, now scientific evidence on the effects of smoking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14214)|
| 3:56:58| After 10 months, the medical specialist reports that he's observed no adverse effects on the nose, throat, and sinuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14218)|
| 3:57:05| 16 years ago, my grandmother died of lung cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14225)|
| 3:57:09| She stopped smoking years before the cancer, but the long-term damage was already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14229)|
| 3:57:14| Smoking one cigarette didn't kill her, just as wearing a mask once won't do any harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14234)|
| 3:57:18| What killed her was long-term use of a substance that she was told by the experts was safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14238)|
| 3:57:23| It was slowly killing her, and she didn't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14243)|
| 3:57:26| It took years of research to discover that smoking kills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14246)|
| 3:57:29| And Mr. Watson spoke earlier about smoking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14249)|
| 3:57:32| The difference is, smoking is a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14252)|
| 3:57:34| Breathing is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14254)|
| 3:57:36| What will we find?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14256)|
| 3:57:38| Let me ask you, what will we find in 5, 10, or 15 years about long-term mask usage in our children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14258)|
| 3:57:46| The most precious gifts that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14266)|
| 3:57:48| We don't know the answer to that right now, but the fact that you are willing to use them as lab rats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14268)|
| 3:57:54| is, quite frankly, a humanitarian issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14274)|
| 3:57:57| And I know that's not your intent, but honestly, intent does not matter here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14277)|
| 3:58:02| That's what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14282)|
| 3:58:03| They are being experimented on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14283)|
| 3:58:05| Masking our children comes with risks, and where there is risk, there must be choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14285)|
| 3:58:12| Make masks optional for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14292)|
| 3:58:14| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14294)|
| 3:58:17| Naomi Elliott, and after that, Isabella Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14297)|
| 3:58:35| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14315)|
| 3:58:36| Naomi Elliott, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14316)|
| 3:58:41| So, we still haven't got a religious exemption, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14321)|
| 3:58:46| I left a message last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14326)|
| 3:58:48| Everyone keeps, you know, passing the buck, as they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14328)|
| 3:58:54| You know, I've talked to the vice principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14334)|
| 3:58:56| I've talked to the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14336)|
| 3:58:58| Her father's talked to the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14338)|
| 3:59:00| Oh, they were willing to give concessions for medical issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14340)|
| 3:59:03| Oh, if you need a mask break, you can go take a mask break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14343)|
| 3:59:06| but then you have to get up away from your learning tools, such as your desk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14346)|
| 3:59:10| where you need to have that to be able to write and utilize that desk for educational purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14350)|
| 3:59:16| and you have to go stand by the door all by yourself when you want a mask break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14356)|
| 3:59:20| She doesn't want a mask break, although that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14360)|
| 3:59:23| We appreciate that concession, but that is not what we asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14363)|
| 3:59:27| We told them it is against our religion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14367)|
| 3:59:30| You see, in the Bible, it says to obey the laws of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14370)|
| 3:59:34| and here you're making regulations that are, in effect, laws for Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14374)|
| 3:59:40| that are having negative effects on us and many other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14380)|
| 3:59:45| And the thing is, with the law of the land in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14385)|
| 3:59:50| our ancestors came here and they shed their blood, sweat, and tears to fight for our freedom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14390)|
| 3:59:57| to fight for our rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14397)|
| 3:59:59| They were trying to escape the tyranny and oppression from other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14399)|
| 4:00:03| Thus, we have freedom in America, or we are supposed to have freedom in the land of the free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14403)|
| 4:00:09| or because you're advising this board that they're within their legal right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14409)|
| 4:00:14| I should say the land of the not-so-free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14414)|
| 4:00:17| You know, anything that contradicts the Constitution of the United States is, in effect, null and void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14417)|
| 4:00:25| It is an invalid law or regulation because your rights shall not be abridged for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14425)|
| 4:00:31| Now, if I'm infringing on your rights, then by all means, sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14431)|
| 4:00:36| if I go out sick with coronavirus and can infect other people, then I'm a direct threat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14436)|
| 4:00:42| I may need to stay home that day and alter my activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14442)|
| 4:00:46| If you're not a direct threat, there is no reason to have a child alter their day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14446)|
| 4:00:51| alter their educational experience, because unless they're a direct threat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14451)|
| 4:00:56| then there's no reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14456)|
| 4:00:58| You're just not giving reasonable accommodations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14458)|
| 4:01:01| The reasonable accommodations they recommended was a virtual school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14461)|
| 4:01:05| I think not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14465)|
| 4:01:06| That was not reasonable when she needs social interactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14466)|
| 4:01:10| All of this is unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14470)|
| 4:01:12| Do you know the long-term damage this is going to do to this generation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14472)|
| 4:01:15| Have you studied in depth on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14475)|
| 4:01:18| You're just going by some flawed recommendations from another bureaucratic department in our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14478)|
| 4:01:25| It's sickening, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14485)|
| 4:01:28| The amygdala in our brain, which is responsible for the fight-or-flight reaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14488)|
| 4:01:34| that's when people have a traumatic experience, whether it's a car accident or early childhood abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14494)|
| 4:01:41| any type of trauma, traumatic event, that predisposes them to post-traumatic stress disorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14501)|
| 4:01:47| And it makes them sensitive to they're triggered very easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14507)|
| 4:01:54| You can look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14514)|
| 4:01:55| There's all kinds of information to back this up from MIT and the NIH and other reputable sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14515)|
| 4:02:03| So what's going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14523)|
| 4:02:05| Ms. Satterfield, your district has these children that are getting shot and killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14525)|
| 4:02:10| What's going to happen in 10 or 20 years when these children can't control their emotions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14530)|
| 4:02:15| because of this long-term damage that's being done to them from these policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14535)|
| 4:02:20| Are you giving me a look like rolling your eyes or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14540)|
| 4:02:25| These are serious matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14545)|
| 4:02:26| Are you going to pay the medical bills for the damage that's done to children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14546)|
| 4:02:31| Or if someone murders someone because they can't control their emotions because they have amygdala damage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14551)|
| 4:02:38| are you going to be responsible for that and pay for that family's loss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14558)|
| 4:02:44| Are you going to pay the medical bills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14564)|
| 4:02:46| This is unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14566)|
| 4:02:51| What about Martin Luther King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14571)|
| 4:02:54| I mean, you're laughing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14574)|
| 4:02:55| This is not a laughing matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14575)|
| 4:02:57| Ma'am, ma'am, can we not direct comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14577)|
| 4:03:00| Speak to the whole board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14580)|
| 4:03:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14581)|
| 4:03:02| Well, this is not a laughing matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14582)|
| 4:03:05| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14585)|
| 4:03:07| Martin Luther King, as well as many other people, have fought for our freedoms and our rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14587)|
| 4:03:12| and fought for equality, and the policies that are currently in place are violating people's rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14592)|
| 4:03:21| They're propagating an atmosphere of inequality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14601)|
| 4:03:27| Is that what we want from Knox County schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14607)|
| 4:03:30| An atmosphere that discrimination is acceptable because a law director said so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14610)|
| 4:03:37| He said you're within your legal rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14617)|
| 4:03:39| What about the color of law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14619)|
| 4:03:41| You can be imprisoned and fined under the color of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14621)|
| 4:03:45| If Isabella Elliott would like to speak now and just say your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14625)|
| 4:03:51| I'm Isabella, and I live in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14631)|
| 4:03:55| So I go to this school, RITA, and a few people have actually been getting a B in overall behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14635)|
| 4:04:03| because they have their mask on wrong or they try to hide from wearing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14643)|
| 4:04:09| because they are scared to, I guess, wear mask breaks like I was before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14649)|
| 4:04:15| And for me, I drink my water bottle and I get mask breaks just because I can hardly breathe sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14655)|
| 4:04:25| And, like, after recess, it's really hot outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14665)|
| 4:04:29| I need to breathe, and when we are at lunch, we are, like, one seat away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14669)|
| 4:04:39| and it's like we get to have our mask off, but when we just walk to the trash can to throw away our food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14679)|
| 4:04:47| we are just technically right next to the trash can, and we still have to put our mask on to wear it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14687)|
| 4:04:54| and go to the trash can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14694)|
| 4:04:57| And I also got to say that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14697)|
| 4:05:03| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14703)|
| 4:05:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14706)|
| 4:05:07| I'm getting scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14707)|
| 4:05:10| Just remember what you told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14710)|
| 4:05:12| Remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14712)|
| 4:05:18| And about hand washing, at the beginning of the year, they told us to wash our hands always,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14718)|
| 4:05:29| even if you don't have to use the bathroom, but some people just skip it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14729)|
| 4:05:33| and then the teacher doesn't say anything about it, and they don't get in trouble or nothing, and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14733)|
| 4:05:40| And...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14740)|
| 4:05:51| Can I yield my time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14751)|
| 4:05:57| Can I yield my time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14757)|
| 4:06:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14760)|
| 4:06:01| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14761)|
| 4:06:02| Can I yield my time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14762)|
| 4:06:03| Can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14763)|
| 4:06:04| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14764)|
| 4:06:05| You don't have to speak the whole time, honey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14765)|
| 4:06:07| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14767)|
| 4:06:08| I mean, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14768)|
| 4:06:09| Your mom has had her five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14769)|
| 4:06:21| Thank you for having me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14781)|
| 4:06:23| Well, thank you for coming to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14783)|
| 4:06:24| Thank you for sharing, sweetie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14784)|
| 4:06:25| You did a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14785)|
| 4:06:30| Kelly Wakefield, and then Kristen Eastman after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14790)|
| 4:06:38| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14798)|
| 4:06:39| My name's Kelly Wakefield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14799)|
| 4:06:40| I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14800)|
| 4:06:42| I don't really have a lot prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14802)|
| 4:06:43| I did this at the last minute, and I so appreciate you letting me speak, because I called you Victoria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14803)|
| 4:06:49| and they were looking for Victoria instead of Virginia, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14809)|
| 4:06:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14813)|
| 4:06:54| And...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14814)|
| 4:06:55| And if you just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14815)|
| 4:06:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14816)|
| 4:06:57| I should say...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14817)|
| 4:06:58| Just say your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14818)|
| 4:06:59| I thought you heard me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14819)|
| 4:07:00| Kelly Wakefield, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14820)|
| 4:07:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14821)|
| 4:07:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14822)|
| 4:07:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14823)|
| 4:07:04| So, the last year, it's been really traumatic, I know, for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14824)|
| 4:07:09| And no matter what side of it you're on, since it seems like it has to be sides, everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14829)|
| 4:07:15| passionate about it, so that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14835)|
| 4:07:19| But what's really, really sad is how our children have to feel, that they're diseased or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14839)|
| 4:07:27| that they have to walk around with a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14847)|
| 4:07:31| You know, I think masks really do dehumanize people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14851)|
| 4:07:36| And the reason I say that, because the way that I have seen us act towards each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14856)|
| 4:07:41| but just not people with masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14861)|
| 4:07:43| Social media has a lot to play with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14863)|
| 4:07:46| This is a comment that I saw, and it said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14866)|
| 4:07:51| This is so sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14871)|
| 4:07:53| And the idiots who don't wear masks are the least likely to die from COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14873)|
| 4:07:58| If we were going to have a pandemic, the least that could happen is some Darwin survival of the fittest going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14878)|
| 4:08:05| I mean, what does that say about where we all are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14885)|
| 4:08:09| That we're wishing that somebody would die to prove our point for our ego?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14889)|
| 4:08:13| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14893)|
| 4:08:17| Most everything has been said here tonight, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14897)|
| 4:08:21| But I do know that like in basic medical school, I might not have degrees that some people have, but I have common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14901)|
| 4:08:29| And I know in basic medical procedures, that if you have a straight A average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14909)|
| 4:08:35| you can fail out for not being able to put your PPE on correctly, dispose of it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14915)|
| 4:08:43| And then we expect our children to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14923)|
| 4:08:46| Why are we selling out people in competencies, then, that can't perform them and expect a child to be able to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14926)|
| 4:08:58| Let's see if I have any more points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14938)|
| 4:09:01| Well, I do want to say this about my children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14941)|
| 4:09:04| I have a 17-year-old son and a 14-year-old son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14944)|
| 4:09:08| And I want to say, first of all, I love our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14948)|
| 4:09:11| I've been so blessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14951)|
| 4:09:13| I have great teachers for my children always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14953)|
| 4:09:16| And I always had great teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14956)|
| 4:09:18| But my 17-year-old son is so scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14958)|
| 4:09:23| He had to do virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14963)|
| 4:09:24| He cannot wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14964)|
| 4:09:25| He has respiratory issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14965)|
| 4:09:27| He cannot wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14967)|
| 4:09:28| And he has gotten so scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14968)|
| 4:09:30| He's six foot tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14970)|
| 4:09:31| He has to have his five foot tall mom because he's hardly left the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14971)|
| 4:09:36| Because he is so scared to even enter a store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14976)|
| 4:09:39| Because he's scared that these Facebook groups are going to take a picture of him and put it on social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14979)|
| 4:09:45| What have we turned into for our kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14985)|
| 4:09:48| Why do we have to shame people because we feel different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14988)|
| 4:09:51| Why should a child feel like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14991)|
| 4:09:53| It's heartbreaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14993)|
| 4:09:55| I want my child, these terms that are used, the new normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14995)|
| 4:09:59| There's no new normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=14999)|
| 4:10:01| That's abnormal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15001)|
| 4:10:02| Anti-masker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15002)|
| 4:10:04| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15004)|
| 4:10:05| Anti, that's divisive terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15005)|
| 4:10:07| We spend a ton of money just putting these commercials out here a ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15007)|
| 4:10:12| Why couldn't that money have been used for fresh water, feeding children, or stuff like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15012)|
| 4:10:16| Where's this money coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15016)|
| 4:10:18| His pockets, is it going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15018)|
| 4:10:19| I don't understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15019)|
| 4:10:21| These children, it's just, it's disheartening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15021)|
| 4:10:24| And I'm going to yield my time because that's all that I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15024)|
| 4:10:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15028)|
| 4:10:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15030)|
| 4:10:32| Kristen Eastman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15032)|
| 4:10:46| She's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15046)|
| 4:10:47| Oh, she's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15047)|
| 4:10:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15048)|
| 4:10:49| Tanya Coates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15049)|
| 4:10:52| And after Tanya, it will be Laura Branson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15052)|
| 4:10:55| Thank you, Tanya Coates, Knox County, president of the Knox County Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15055)|
| 4:11:00| So, I didn't come here tonight to talk about masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15060)|
| 4:11:05| Even though I can say to this, I'm not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15065)|
| 4:11:08| I'm going to revert back to my more so of the days of the electric company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15068)|
| 4:11:15| You know, some of you may be younger than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15075)|
| 4:11:19| Most of you look younger than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15079)|
| 4:11:22| The word is that we hope that the word of the day will be mitigate, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15082)|
| 4:11:28| That we're going to vaccinate to mitigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15088)|
| 4:11:31| To make sure that we are making sure that people are safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15091)|
| 4:11:35| But again, nope, I'm not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15095)|
| 4:11:37| I'm not going to talk about us when we have seven weeks of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15097)|
| 4:11:42| You have excellently done an excellent job here in the state of Tennessee of having all your educators present and working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15102)|
| 4:11:53| At least 90% of them showed up back to work this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15113)|
| 4:11:57| But with seven weeks of school, no, I am not going to talk about where we have been and where we are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15117)|
| 4:12:05| Because I know the word mitigate is going to settle with a bunch of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15125)|
| 4:12:10| We only have seven weeks of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15130)|
| 4:12:12| I wish that the conversation would have been today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15132)|
| 4:12:15| That we would have talked about that we have a statewide testing that's going to be enforced upon our kids in the middle of a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15135)|
| 4:12:23| Or I would have wished that we thought about 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15143)|
| 4:12:27| Since 20 years ago, we have not raised the taxes here in Knox County to actually help take care of our heating and cooling system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15147)|
| 4:12:35| To make sure that our kids can breathe fresh air and not have to be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15155)|
| 4:12:40| But nope, I'm not going to talk about mask coverings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15160)|
| 4:12:45| I'm just not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15165)|
| 4:12:46| But I am going to say that I hope that the passion that was in this room today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15166)|
| 4:12:52| And I know the conversations are genuinely worried about their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15172)|
| 4:12:57| But we got some inequities in public education that needs to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15177)|
| 4:13:01| And we need the research to be just as we talked about face coverings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15181)|
| 4:13:06| No, I said we're not going to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15186)|
| 4:13:08| But when it comes to budgeting, when you need to have money to actually help run Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15188)|
| 4:13:15| That that same energy is that they're willing to raise taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15195)|
| 4:13:20| Or make sure that kids are not being penalized over testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15200)|
| 4:13:26| Or that educators can actually come to work and not have to worry about taking care of their other families that are going to be scrutinized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15206)|
| 4:13:35| But no, I'm not going to talk about masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15215)|
| 4:13:37| Because again, the word of the day is going to mitigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15217)|
| 4:13:41| Mr. Superintendent Thomas, he has one of his strategic goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15221)|
| 4:13:47| That we need to make sure that we're focusing on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15227)|
| 4:13:51| And making sure we're fostering a positive culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15231)|
| 4:13:55| We got a long way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15235)|
| 4:13:57| Because we deal with a lot of disparities in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15237)|
| 4:14:00| When we have kids that are dealing with suicide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15240)|
| 4:14:03| In Farragut well before this pandemic came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15243)|
| 4:14:07| And we have kids killing kids in our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15247)|
| 4:14:11| But we're going to worry about what's on our face covering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15251)|
| 4:14:15| No, I'm not going to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15255)|
| 4:14:17| Because our kids are suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15257)|
| 4:14:19| And they got a lot on their minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15259)|
| 4:14:22| And we as parents, we need to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15262)|
| 4:14:24| Because me, I have kids in my school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15264)|
| 4:14:28| I have my adult kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15268)|
| 4:14:30| And I have my nieces that go to this doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15270)|
| 4:14:32| I thank you for what you have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15272)|
| 4:14:35| Because you have actually helped mitigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15275)|
| 4:14:38| You have gotten us to seven weeks of school left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15278)|
| 4:14:42| You should be proud of yourselves for what you've done for this school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15282)|
| 4:14:48| Because on the other side of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15288)|
| 4:14:50| They have to argue with legislators about just being in school for 80 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15290)|
| 4:14:55| This is not where we need to be fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15295)|
| 4:14:58| Our fight needs to be making sure that we're doing what's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15298)|
| 4:15:02| For every single kid in this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15302)|
| 4:15:06| Every single family in this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15306)|
| 4:15:09| Because we have challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15309)|
| 4:15:11| But again, people that do the research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15311)|
| 4:15:15| We need your help when it comes to funding our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15315)|
| 4:15:18| Because in the state of Tennessee, we're number 46 in the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15318)|
| 4:15:23| Of what we spend on per pupil for the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15323)|
| 4:15:26| And we need to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15326)|
| 4:15:28| And I'm asking you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15328)|
| 4:15:30| With seven weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15330)|
| 4:15:32| Knowing that your teachers in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15332)|
| 4:15:35| Your superintendent, his administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15335)|
| 4:15:38| They've done everything we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15338)|
| 4:15:40| To try to make sure this district stays on top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15340)|
| 4:15:43| We're not going to talk about masks in seven weeks worth of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15343)|
| 4:15:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15347)|
| 4:15:49| Thank you, Laura Branson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15349)|
| 4:15:51| And Miss Branson gets the honor of being our last speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15351)|
| 4:16:01| You meant to say save the best for last, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15361)|
| 4:16:03| That is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15363)|
| 4:16:05| If you could state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15365)|
| 4:16:08| I am Laura Branson and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15368)|
| 4:16:14| I have some prepared words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15374)|
| 4:16:16| But some things came up in the meantime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15376)|
| 4:16:18| That I just really wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15378)|
| 4:16:21| We most definitely were segregated tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15381)|
| 4:16:25| Because the definition of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15385)|
| 4:16:27| Is the act or practice of segregating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15387)|
| 4:16:29| Is a setting apart or separation of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15389)|
| 4:16:32| From things or others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15392)|
| 4:16:35| Or from the main body or group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15395)|
| 4:16:38| It's also the institutional separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15398)|
| 4:16:41| Ethnic, racial, religious or other minority group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15401)|
| 4:16:44| From the dominant majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15404)|
| 4:16:46| I have to say I'm learning very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15406)|
| 4:16:48| We are no longer the minority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15408)|
| 4:16:50| We are the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15410)|
| 4:16:52| And we want our voices heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15412)|
| 4:16:54| I cannot believe we were segregated to a room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15414)|
| 4:16:58| And if you walked back there and saw the hypocrisy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15418)|
| 4:17:00| Of the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15420)|
| 4:17:02| Where we were literally put in a small enclosed space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15422)|
| 4:17:05| With almost no circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15425)|
| 4:17:09| We were literally going through that area on top of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15429)|
| 4:17:11| If you really believe that these masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15431)|
| 4:17:13| And the social distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15433)|
| 4:17:15| Or I should say physical distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15435)|
| 4:17:17| Is that important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15437)|
| 4:17:19| Why did you do that to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15439)|
| 4:17:21| I also wanted to bring up something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15441)|
| 4:17:24| Well first of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15444)|
| 4:17:27| If you don't believe that we have a deep state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15447)|
| 4:17:30| Running this nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15450)|
| 4:17:32| And basically running the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15452)|
| 4:17:34| You're not really paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15454)|
| 4:17:36| If you think I'm crazy for saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15456)|
| 4:17:38| You're not paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15458)|
| 4:17:40| They are trying to divide us as a people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15460)|
| 4:17:42| Because we are weaker when we are divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15462)|
| 4:17:44| And they are succeeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15464)|
| 4:17:46| So we have to be the ones to put our foot down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15466)|
| 4:17:48| And say no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15468)|
| 4:17:50| We need to stick together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15470)|
| 4:17:52| And support each other through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15472)|
| 4:17:54| Doctor Buchanan said tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15474)|
| 4:17:56| That masks do work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15476)|
| 4:17:58| My question for her is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15478)|
| 4:18:00| If they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15480)|
| 4:18:02| Why did she contract COVID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15482)|
| 4:18:04| She's probably wearing her mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15484)|
| 4:18:06| Religiously all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15486)|
| 4:18:08| As she should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15488)|
| 4:18:10| Why does she get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15490)|
| 4:18:12| Explain that to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15492)|
| 4:18:14| Where's the science in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15494)|
| 4:18:16| And I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15496)|
| 4:18:18| I don't mean any disrespect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15498)|
| 4:18:20| But she's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15500)|
| 4:18:22| I refuse to teach my child the proper method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15502)|
| 4:18:24| Of wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15504)|
| 4:18:26| In fact I will not be sending my future kindergartner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15506)|
| 4:18:28| My third one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15508)|
| 4:18:30| To school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15510)|
| 4:18:32| If we are requiring masks next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15512)|
| 4:18:34| And the 7 day average in cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15514)|
| 4:18:36| Is the lowest it's been since June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15516)|
| 4:18:38| In that state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15518)|
| 4:18:40| Again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15520)|
| 4:18:42| Go do the science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15522)|
| 4:18:44| Figure that one out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15524)|
| 4:18:46| It is time to return to normal life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15526)|
| 4:18:48| There is no new normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15528)|
| 4:18:50| That's crap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15530)|
| 4:18:52| Not just for our own mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15532)|
| 4:18:54| But especially for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15534)|
| 4:18:56| Children and teenagers already have a hard enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15536)|
| 4:18:58| Communicating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15538)|

| 4:19:06| We're just turning their brains to mush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15546)|

| 4:19:10| In fact most kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15550)|
| 4:19:12| I bet are handed a cell phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15552)|
| 4:19:14| Before they're even handed a rattle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15554)|
| 4:19:16| Now all they hear is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15556)|

| 4:19:20| Stay this far away from people at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15560)|
| 4:19:22| Hugging and handshaking is bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15562)|
| 4:19:24| People who choose to not cover their faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15564)|
| 4:19:26| And keep a safe distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15566)|
| 4:19:28| Don't actually care about you and your well being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15568)|
| 4:19:30| Dr. Fauci.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15570)|

| 4:19:36| They ebb and flow as consistently as the ocean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15576)|
| 4:19:38| First it was social distancing and masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15578)|
| 4:19:40| Then the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15580)|
| 4:19:42| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15582)|
| 4:19:44| Oops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15584)|
| 4:19:46| Now you need to wear two masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15586)|
| 4:19:48| And you're still not safe with the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15588)|
| 4:19:50| And you have to continue wearing the mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15590)|
| 4:19:52| And continue staying away from friends and family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15592)|
| 4:19:54| The rhetoric of this goes on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15594)|
| 4:19:56| And this is all ludicrous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15596)|
| 4:19:58| We've got to wake everybody up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15598)|

| 4:20:18| Who in fact have told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15618)|

| 4:20:26| That it is toxic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15626)|
| 4:20:28| My children need to breathe fresh clean air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15628)|

| 4:20:36| To govern myself and my own children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15636)|
| 4:20:38| Telling me that my child is responsible for everyone else's accord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15638)|

| 4:20:42| And I will die fighting for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210407?start=15642)|
