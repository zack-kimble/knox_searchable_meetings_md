| 0:03:31| For the Mayor's Report, well, first of all, thank all the people who came out last night for the Lakeshore Park meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=211)|
| 0:03:41| to begin the process of updating our master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| About close to 200 people showed up, and we gave the Lakeshore Park board, gave a good, Mr. Tom McAdams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=225)|
| 0:03:54| on behalf of the board, gave a good overview, starting with the Indians on the use of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=234)|
| 0:04:01| It was really quite interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| And then also a video was shown that was prepared by River Media to kind of help get people, their creative juices flowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=244)|
| 0:04:13| And then we had a lot of good participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| Dr. Bill Lyons also talked about the process we will be using, and a lot of folks started sharing their ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=256)|
| 0:04:23| If you weren't able to attend last night, there are many ways you can share your ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| You can call our office, the Mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| You can email us, or you can go to our website at cityofknoxville.org slash lakeshore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=271)|
| 0:04:40| and you can provide some of your ideas at that website as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| There will be more meetings, more opportunities as we're going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| If you find yourself walking in the park anytime soon, you might get stopped by a surveyor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=290)|
| 0:04:57| a person who will ask your opinions right there as you're using the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| So there are a lot of ways that we're reaching out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| So please participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| We want to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| This is a park for the entire city, so we want to hear your ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| Mayor, before you leave that, is that big sketch, the conceptual plan, on the website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Because that would be helpful for people to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Yes, heads are shaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| What you'll see is the original plan, the current plan, that we are in the process of updating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| And when that plan was designed 11 or so years ago, we didn't realize that we'd get all this extra acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=331)|
| 0:05:40| And so there's a lot of land now that is available to plan, to program for the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=340)|
| 0:05:48| and parts of the master plan that may not have been built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| All of that's still open for discussion on how it all flows together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| Okay, there's also going to be a meeting next Tuesday, June 18th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| to explore the possibilities to enhance the World's Fair Park as a center for cultural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=362)|
| 0:06:09| We previously announced that, that we have a committee that is co-chaired by our own Dr. Bill Lyons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=369)|
| 0:06:15| and UT's Jan Simic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| And this is a working group that consists largely of World's Fair Park stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| The group will determine feasibility and support of the concept of making the World's Fair Park more of a cultural resource center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=383)|
| 0:06:31| The meeting, of course, is open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| This is on Tuesday, June 18th at 5.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=393)|
| 0:06:38| And I don't have the location on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| It's at the Windows of the World.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| There's a room there, a meeting room there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| At the Holiday Inn on the World's Fair Park, Windows to the World.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| There is a meeting room right next to the Windows to the World.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| You did tell me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| Okay, I am going to call on, that's the end of my announcements, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| I think I'm going to tag on to something Vice Mayor Pavlis is about to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| So I'll call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| Start the committee report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| Yeah, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| And we've had some exciting announcement lately of, well, not only for South Knoxville, but Knoxville as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=429)|
| 0:07:16| So today was another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| I told the crowd I felt like Bob Barker as an emcee here so much lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| But it's all good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| And we announced today that Legacy Parks has done some tremendous work to bring the nation's largest adventure racing series here in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=444)|
| 0:07:34| And what that is, it's 200 of the best adventure racers in North America will come together in Knoxville October the 10th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=454)|
| 0:07:42| through Saturday the 12th to compete for the 2013 Checkpoint Tracker Adventure Racing Championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| Now, I'm expecting this council to put a team together for this because they only go for 100 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=468)|
| 0:07:56| It's a nonstop course that you traverse by map and compass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| It takes about 30 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| There will be trekking, caving, mountain biking, paddling, rappelling, ascending, and a mystery something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=483)|
| 0:08:10| So Knoxville, because of its, you know, urban wilderness, is going to enjoy these 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=490)|
| 0:08:18| And I'm sure they'll bring others with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| So it will probably be around 300 people for three or four nights to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| And I particularly want to say that South Knoxville will be open for business at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| I was wondering that, and I'm glad that you clarified it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| I wanted to go ahead and bring it up early because I knew you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| But it's just a great tribute to the work that Carol Evans has done in Legacy Parks and the Appalachian Mountain Bike Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=515)|
| 0:08:43| and it puts us on the map nationally as a destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| So very happy to make that announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| And this apparently will end the year, the racing series for that year, and they crowned their national champion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=531)|

| 0:09:10| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=550)|

| 0:09:15| What do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| I entered Nick Pavlis in it because it was his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| I thought that was important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| What's wrong with the rest of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| I was considering you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| There's a snail division we could get in that maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| I recommend Dwayne Grieve represent us as well on the cave trekking perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| Anyways, it's big news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| It's going to be a really great event, and it's something that, as mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| is going to bring folks into our community as well, as well as provide some great fun for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=580)|

| 0:11:50| I'm John King, PO Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| And you know that I have to start the timer by council rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=716)|

| 0:12:02| This is one time I may be able to comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| On behalf of Apex Homes, the applicants, Apex Homes slash Jack Stooksbury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| I'm here to request withdrawal of our application for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| I've discussed that withdrawal with Councilman Brown and your council, city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=736)|
| 0:12:23| as well as I did get a chance to talk to Ms. Gaither before this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| but sorry I didn't get the word spread earlier, but we're here requesting withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| That was 15 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| Now, don't think you're going to get the other 4 or 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| There's some things coming up later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Just add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| I was going to make a motion that we approve the withdrawal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| but before I do that, there are several residents from the Brooksville area who have come down tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=776)|
| 0:13:04| and I would like to allow them at least the opportunity to stand and be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=784)|
| 0:13:16| I want to thank them for being here tonight, and it's a very good turnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| Thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| Mr. DelVopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| I was going to ask Charles Swanson or Mr. Frost exactly what is the legal effect of that withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=807)|
| 0:13:35| MPC was talking about an R1 zone replacing a C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| Does that mean it stays C3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| In other words, how do we interpret a withdrawal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| What does it mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| It will remain as it's presently known because all rezonings have to go first to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=825)|
| 0:13:52| and then approved or denied at city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| So we're not reaching that point because they've requested it to be withdrawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| so it will remain R1 and C3 respectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| So they went through half the process, but without council action, it remains as it was originally decided years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=840)|
| 0:14:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| And I see Councilor Swanson agreeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| There's discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| I don't think we had a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| We have a motion and a second to withdraw 12K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=867)|

| 0:16:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| Boss Evans, purchasing agent for the city, 228 Braden Court, Clinton, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=977)|
| 0:16:24| No, that is not the norm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| I'll be frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Occasionally it does happen, and let me explain why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| A lot of times the construction firms in particular are literally getting the prices from their suppliers out in the hallway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=992)|
| 0:16:44| and in our purchasing office literally minutes before they have to turn in the bid package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1004)|
| 0:16:51| So, no, it's not the norm, but that type of thing does occasionally happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1011)|
| 0:16:59| On this one, I did some checking after you had raised the issue earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| and what Southern Constructors said was that, yes, they had intended to and will use two DBE-certified subcontractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1025)|
| 0:17:19| excuse me, TDOT-certified DBE subcontractors, erosion solutions for the erosion control portion of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1039)|
| 0:17:28| and Planet Incorporated for the texture finishings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| but they just failed to write down the names of the companies, the amounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1054)|
| 0:17:40| and exactly what they were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| It just is an oversight on their part, and we've had, through the engineering department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| we've had kind of a heart-to-heart with them and said, look, you need to make sure that's done properly in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| so we don't want to have to be up here answering questions, bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1073)|
| 0:17:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Councilman Dalvopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| Yeah, I have a question for Jim Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| This is in my district, and I'm happy to see you getting this work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| It looks like we only had one bid, and I was thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| why isn't this work sexy enough to have all kinds of folks chasing after it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| Jim Hagerman, the director of engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| It's a surprise to us, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| Usually when we do this kind of work, we get several bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| We felt okay about this particular case because they were within 10% of our engineer estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1112)|
| 0:18:39| So you have a check internal that if it's somehow out of whack, you might do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| We did all our normal advertising procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| Maybe the economy is improving and people aren't as hungry as they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| That's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| Mayor Brown, did you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| I'm through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute change order number one to contract number C-13172| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| with Ronald Frank's Construction Company, LLC, increasing the contract amount by $24,904.48| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1153)|
| 0:19:21| for a new contract total of $446,066.48 for the City View Riverwalk Extension Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1161)|
| 0:19:29| and to extend the date of completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| I was just going to ask Mr. Hagerman for an update and timeline on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1175)|
| 0:19:43| I don't know the new timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| They are pretty much shut down until they get rid of the soils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| This is actually going to get split into two pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| You're going to see some more of this next week because this is the critical piece for getting them back working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| The time is extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| That's part of this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| I believe it's to July 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| The contract will be extended to July 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| Mr. Hagerman mentioned there's a second part to this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| This is the hauling part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| What it is, we've got into the bad dirt over in and around the City View site a little bit more than we thought we'd get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| So this is the hauling portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| We need to get it done so the contractor can get moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| What you'll see next week is there's going to have to be a change order to the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| or the construction engineering inspection contract as well to document the bad dirt on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1228)|
| 0:20:37| document the disposal of the bad dirt, and actually using their kind of subcontract to dispose of the dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| So it's going to be about another $48,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| You'll see next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| Councilman Del Vecchio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| I guess he tickled my fancy there for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| We did a phase one on all this south riverfront area where the river walk was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1253)|
| 0:21:00| Did we not identify this, or we just didn't identify the full extent of the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| Well, we all understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| As you dig a little deeper, sometimes you come into things you don't identify from your surface investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| We had a pretty good idea of what the dirt was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| Most of the dirt we've had over there that we've moved, we've been able to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| and use as a daily cover at a landfill and hadn't had to pay for any disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| As we dug closer to the shore of the river, we got in some dirt we weren't expecting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| so we've had to take that dirt out and get it properly characterized and get it properly disposed of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| Do you have to burn it or do something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| This is going to Chestnut Ridge, a special cell in the waste up at Chestnut Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1302)|

| 0:21:57| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1318)|

| 0:22:19| Councilman Dellivaki.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| Quick question for Jim, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| We're basically going to handle the runoff off the parking lot pavement so we can capture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| and clean it up before it gets into the stormwater streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| This is their service facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| So there is some...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| Oils and stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Yeah, diesel and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| There is actually already some treatment in place there, but as it turns out, it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| somewhat inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| There's just not enough capacity, and we're getting some petroleum stuff into the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1368)|
| 0:22:56| and it's also making the asphalt crumble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| So we're getting asphalt crumbles in the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| Is that the professional term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| There's a cake with asphalt crumbles, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| Well, we had a chocolate cake this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| We're going to replace some of the asphalt, or this project includes replacing some of that asphalt with concrete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1392)|
| 0:23:23| so that that stops as well as the improved treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| The diesel fuel was breaking down, or some solvent was breaking down the asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| You capture it, what, in a basin and then pump it out and treat it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| What do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| There's a standard water quality unit, as we call them, is an underground chamber that allows some settling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1416)|
| 0:23:46| It's got a skimmer on top, so it captures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| So you catch it, and you clean it, and you deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| Yeah, and it still discharges to the creek, but if the capacity of that unit isn't big enough for the circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1432)|
| 0:24:00| then some of it's going to still get in the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| So in this particular case, we just need more capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1449)|

| 0:24:31| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| 11G is a resolution approving an amendment to the Historic Market Square Redevelopment and Urban Renewal Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| to amend the boundary of the area subject to the plan to clarify that the area covered by the plan includes 505 Market Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1481)|
| 0:24:48| and confirming and ratifying tax increment financing approved by Resolution R-173-09 of the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1488)|
| 0:24:56| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| I think I know the answer to this, but essentially we're doing some housekeeping here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| We already approved the TIF activity for the urban outfitters, remodeling and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| and it turns out we had to review the boundary and have KCDC include that in the definition of the redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1508)|
| 0:25:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| We need to amend the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| That's all we're doing at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| If you don't amend the map, then you can't do the financing and all the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, about changing the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| I mean, can you just tell us what's the process you go through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| Jordana Nelson is here with KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| She's been the one working the details on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| I'd like for her to come forward to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| If there's another building that's adjacent to the area that wants to get a TIF, they can automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| Well, you can always amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| These plans were created by Council and KCDC and can be amended by Council and KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| So you always have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| Jordana, if you want to talk about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| Hi, I'm Jordana Nelson, 4019 Tallulah Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| This is essentially a housekeeping measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| The plan was already amended to include this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| However, we don't feel like the amendment was quite specific enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| So we're coming back and just being very specific about including this particular building in the redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1569)|
| 0:26:16| But we feel like it's already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| How difficult or how easy is it for another building adjacent to become part of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| or part of the redevelopment area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| How does that process work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| Essentially, it's the same process that we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| We would have to come back before Council and Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| and have that amendment to the redevelopment area approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| Does a building have to be adjacent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| Well, your mic is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| Does it have to be adjacent to the area or can some other place downtown become part of the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1603)|
| 0:26:50| What I can tell you about that is that we have not yet approved an area in a non-contiguous redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1610)|
| 0:26:58| It would probably depend on what the financing that you were trying to do would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| But my gut reaction would be that that would not be a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| But it's certainly something that we could look at on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| If there's a particular building you want us to look at, please let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| There's more than one redevelopment district downtown, so it might be contiguous to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| Yeah, I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| I just didn't know the process that you went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1643)|

| 0:27:30| 12A is an ordinance to amend the capital budget and the operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| Both as approved by Ordinance O75212, 2012, for fiscal year 2012-13, and to transfer surplus, excess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| or unencumbered funds between various units and funds as reflected in the various funds and budgets of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1668)|

| 0:27:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| I would like to ask Jim York to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| Although I know this is a housekeeping item, it may be a little confusing to some, especially who are not on City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1674)|
| 0:28:02| Jim York, Finance Director for the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| What this is is our standard end-of-the-year ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| As we close the books on 6-30, there may be some departments or funds that are either over or under budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1690)|
| 0:28:18| and this provides the mechanism by which we amend the budget in order to comply with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1698)|
| 0:28:28| We cannot spend anything that is not budget, and this just is kind of a cleanup activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1708)|
| 0:28:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1718)|

| 0:28:49| regarding the definition of pet dog to exclude service dogs that are in training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1735)|

| 0:29:24| 12D is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 15, Article 2, Division 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| known as the Knoxville Fair Housing Opportunities Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| to update the ordinance with current regulatory information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| and provide for changes in the procedures for the investigation of fair housing complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| We have some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| I just wanted to ask Ms. Wade to tell us in a little more detail than is shown here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1784)|
| 0:29:51| how this process is working, making sure that nothing slides through the cracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Becky Wade, Director of Community Development for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| This is really an effort to strengthen our ability to handle any fair housing complaints that come to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1799)|
| 0:30:07| With this action, we will transfer the task of investigation to the Tennessee Human Rights Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| They have a staff here locally in Knoxville in their housing department of five positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1814)|
| 0:30:21| trained investigators that do this on a day-to-day basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| Right now, they investigate all the fair housing complaints in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| including Knox County, and the city of Knoxville is the only place that investigates its own complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1830)|
| 0:30:38| We have a staff of one trained investigator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| and because that is one person without backup, we feel like this action will enable us to respond more quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1841)|
| 0:30:51| and strengthen that ability to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| We still affirmatively further fair housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| We will continue to promote training and education about fair housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| and we still have all the language in the ordinance that makes that against the law to discriminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1862)|
| 0:31:11| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| I just wanted to highlight one of the good news in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| It states that the city of Knoxville has seen decreased, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| fair housing complaints to the city of Knoxville have decreased steadily over the past several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| Does that mean that fair housing complaints have down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| One, I was looking at the numbers, and two, if that trend changes, are we going to monitor that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| so if that trend changes that we could then take action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| We can always respond and go back to being a fair housing assistance program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| That's what we're classified as now, and that gives us the authority to investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| We certainly will communicate and work closely with Tennessee Human Rights Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| on the investigations in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| But they have decreased steadily over the past four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| That's great news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| I would like to, well, I'll call on the other council members, but I do want to introduce you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| The executive director of the Tennessee Human Rights Commission is here, Ms. Beverly Watts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| and she came from Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| And so either after you all have asked your questions, then I'll ask Ms. Watts to come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1934)|
| 0:32:20| because I would like you to meet her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| Becky has met with staff, and Becky and I both met with Ms. Watts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| I feel quite confident that they have both the desire, the passion for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| This is their job, the job of her organization, her staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| And they have the capacity to handle this even more effectively than we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| because of the team that they have on their staff there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Yes, Mayor, I was going to ask Ms. Watts to come down myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| but certainly it's an important thing for our housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| and I believe and I hope that we'll be on the right track in terms of passing this to the Tennessee Human Rights Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1974)|
| 0:33:03| And I'll have a question for Ms. Watts when she comes to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| Ms. Wade, this afternoon you did answer my questions very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| but you pointed out that you do have workshops for landlords so that they are aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| Do you think that maybe those attendance at those workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| and their success might be contributing to the decline in the number of complaints, or is it coincidental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2001)|
| 0:33:28| Well, I would hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| I would hope that our training efforts have helped to educate landlords and property owners in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| so that they better understand what the laws are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| You know, we will continue those efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| We'll continue to work with the Equality Coalition for housing opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| They do an annual meeting where landlords, property owners can come learn about fair housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| So we'll continue to support those efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| And our new rental rehab program that will allow landlords and property owners to get funds from the city to rehab rental property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2034)|
| 0:34:05| we are going to require that they have fair housing training to be a participant in our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| Thank you for driving all the way from Nashville to be with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| Would you please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| Beverly Watts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| I'm the Executive Director for the Tennessee Human Rights Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| We've been in business for about 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| We have five staff people here, 29 total across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| Our job really is to enforce the Tennessee Human Rights Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| So we enforce fair housing all over except for Knoxville right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| And we've collaborated and worked with the Knoxville staff over the years that we have been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| And somehow our entire staff is now here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| The rest of the staff handles employment and public accommodation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| So we do everything across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| We're ready to work with the city of Knoxville to ensure that residents in the city of Knoxville understands their rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| and that those housing providers understand their responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| And we've, in fact, done training with ECHO and with the apartment owners associations in this area over the last seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2103)|
| 0:35:12| since I've been the director to help them understand as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| If there are any questions, I'll be happy to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| I have staff with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| Sabrina Hooper, our Deputy Director, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| And Richard Gazepko, who is our Housing Officer here in Knoxville, is with us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2122)|
| 0:35:29| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| Mayor Brown, you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| I had one question that I wanted to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| Are the complaints down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| I know we're concerned about Knoxville, but across the state, I'm curious, are complaints up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2136)|
| 0:35:43| Are they down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| Or how's that going in recent years across the statewide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| Across the state, we're probably running an average of about 120, 130 intakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2148)|
| 0:35:56| And we're closing somewhere around that amount every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| And that's been going on for the last seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| There are peaks and valleys in this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| I've been doing it for a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| And what I figured out is that sometimes it works and actually training does help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| but generally there are always some things that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| Sometimes landlords forget to accommodate the person's disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| and sometimes there's a spike in issues around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| Service animal issues, especially in housing, always comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| So we see a variety of issues and a variety of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| But I think we're on average about 130, which has been consistent for the last seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| There is an increase in not rental, but there is an increase in the notion of financial issues in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2196)|
| 0:36:45| And those are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Generally in West Tennessee, not as much in East Tennessee today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| And I did attend your conference, I believe, last year at the Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| Yeah, the roundtable discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| And I know Councilman Wallace was also there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| and I want to say it was a very informative and a very good session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2220)|
| 0:37:06| So thank you very much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| Yes, well, I wanted to thank Ms. Watts for coming here and informing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| I hope that as the process goes on that you will keep our team fully informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| when there are problems so that we can sort of take a look at ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| and see if we're doing everything we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| And I'm sure you will coordinate with Wade's division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| We coordinate with Memphis, Nashville, and everyone else with respect to furthering fair housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| And we'll be happy to provide all the necessary details and information that you will need to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| if there are any issues or concerns that you might need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| Sounds like a good team effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| You've got the inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| Thank you so much, Ms. Watts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| And we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| 12E is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| Flood Damage and Prevention to adopt the newest flood maps and regulatory changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| 12G is an ordinance to close a portion of Town Center Boulevard from southwest side of parcel 98.11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| and 229 feet northwest of south North Shore Drive center line to northwest side of parcel 98.07,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2300)|
| 0:38:28| 696 feet northwest of south North Shore Drive center line subject to conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| and authorizing the mayor to execute quick claim deeds to the adjacent property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| site, Inc., applicant, second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| Mayor, I'll move to approve and then I'll move to hear it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| Now, do you want to speak to the motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| or are you going to speak to the emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| The approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| I'd like to ask Mr. Cullum to come up and explain why they're asking for the emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| Bud Cullum, 6312 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| Obviously, I think most people on this council know I'm the developer or one of the developers of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| Very big project as far as all of the roads that we built, all of the site and grading and drainage and utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2360)|
| 0:39:28| When the final as-built survey was done, there were a couple issues on either side of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| and one of those pertained to the landscaping retaining wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| and a sidewalk that in the final analysis was a few inches or a foot or so over what was the right-of-way line that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2378)|
| 0:39:46| and ourselves had platted originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| Same issue happened on the other side of the road where we placed some water quality unit structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| and then a small retaining wall around that side, same issue on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2395)|
| 0:40:02| The city and the engineers felt that they didn't want to have that in the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2402)|
| 0:40:10| so they asked us to replat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| I'm speaking in very general terms here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| I have my engineer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| If there's any more specific questions or details that I've left out, I may ask him to get up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2418)|
| 0:40:25| Basically, that is so that the area would be in our private property so that the city would never have any responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2425)|
| 0:40:36| from a liability standpoint or from a maintenance standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2436)|
| 0:40:43| But also, though, there's a scheduling issue that one of the reasons you asked for it to be on emergency reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| The reason I asked for it to be on emergency reading is there was a series of bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| and letters of credit that were issued securing not only Target stores as a property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| but the State Department of Transportation and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| And from a timing standpoint, some of those are set to expire, and we need to probably replace with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2463)|
| 0:41:13| But in order to do that, because of all the legal entanglements of having Target and the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| and everybody else together, we really need to have both readings occur on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| and that will allow us then to isolate out and do a renewable bond that will protect the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| for any remaining work that needs to be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| Councilman Dalibopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| This is a technical cleanup, so the bond issues can go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| It's kind of a housekeeping item, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| I got a question for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| I think it's just because that's foolish enough to read this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| In the AIS section, it talks about the 229 feet and the 696 feet, and that's what Ms. Mitchell read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2508)|
| 0:41:57| If you read the technical plat descriptions of portion one and two, there's references to a 1,279 square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2517)|
| 0:42:07| and that may just be a pure area matter in a 646.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| And I just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| I'm looking at page three of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| I'm assuming those are different things and that we are not misstating the number of feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| or whatever it is we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| The description, I would assume, is a surveyor's description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| and he probably did it with a transit and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| But I was wondering if that was a discrepancy you needed to look at or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| I'd love to have the training to be able to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| I'm going to have to defer to our director of engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| That's more an engineering question than it is a lawyer question, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| Ken, if you had your little, you know, planet thing there, you could stretch it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| and go 10 degrees to the north and 12 to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| Actually, no, I couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| Congressman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Councilman, are you looking at the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| Yeah, I'm looking at the ordinance language on the third page of it where it has the property descriptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2578)|
| 0:43:05| And if I had two hours, I guess I could plot out all that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| and where you start and where you end up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| But there was a reference to 1,279 feet in the third from the last line of portion one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| and 646 square feet in the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| I'm assuming that's a calculation that's totally accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| I don't know whether the caption just references where it is in relationship to North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2604)|
| 0:43:30| but I was hoping someone would check those numbers because they were different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| Yeah, the distances that are described in the agenda summary are just locational,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2614)|
| 0:43:45| and the area is the amount of. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| It's a computation of the actual area in that. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| Calculation of the area that's within that described area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| You know, I didn't have my compass out and everything to actually plot that, but I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| And, of course, it says. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| So they're consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| That's why we have our engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| It says 1,279 square feet more or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| Yes, well, we always say more or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| That's lawyer language, more or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| We never say exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| That answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| It was just a technical one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Thank you, Mr. Collum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| So we have the motion to amend, and I need a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| I mean to make it. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| I'm sorry, to amend it to make it an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| Motion to amend to make it an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| Don't we have to approve it first or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| We have the motion to approve, and then there's. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| We don't vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| Now, instead, there's a motion to amend to make it an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| And so now we're on to vote as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| It's a motion to approve as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| You actually have to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| It's already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| Did you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| We already voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| No, after the vote I want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| We're finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| I just want to thank Mr. Collum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| If any of my colleagues have not had a chance to go out and see the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| and see what they've done in terms of the roadways and this sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| the landscaping, it's very impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| We really appreciate what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| And I know my colleague, Mr. Pavlis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| will be excited to know what you're going to be doing down in his district also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| I'm going to go get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| I'm going to go get that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| You're going to get that one too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| Watch it, Mr. Collum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| If you have any problems out there, give it to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| 12H is in ordinance approving the request of Rufus H. Smith, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| and Company for an amendment to the West City Sector Plan from low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| to medium-density residential for property located on the southeast side of Dean Hill Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| northeast side of Winchester Drive, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2762)|
| 0:46:12| Madam Mayor, we have three issues dealing with this particular one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| Would someone explain the order in which we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| Well, first you amend the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| Then you amend the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2785)|
| 0:46:29| Then you amend the actual zoning classification for that piece of property itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| But you can't rezone property so that it would be inconsistent with either the sector plan or the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| So you have to do those other two first because it's not appropriate under state law for you to amend a parcel of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2799)|
| 0:46:47| property to a zoning designation that it is not planned for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2807)|
| 0:46:53| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| If you're concerned about the zoning, though, you still go through the other two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| or do you not deal with the other two if you're concerned about the zoning classification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| Well, if you don't want it to be rezoned, there's no reason to do any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| Councilman Dallvopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| Buzz is here to help us understand some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| And as I understand it, reading the material, the staff wanted to stay low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2838)|
| 0:47:27| and not increase the density to up to 12 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| I think they were asking for 10, but is that a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| And is that the full commission acted differently on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| but the staff thought that it was more correct or more consonant with the local single-family housing to keep it as a low-density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2862)|
| 0:47:51| which would be almost like up to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| It was 5.99 units per acre, which I guess for ease of discussion is six units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2873)|
| 0:48:00| That's what low-density residential would allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| In the city, that's the cutoff we use, 5.99 units per acre for low-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2883)|
| 0:48:10| And the medium density goes up to 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| Actually, in the city, medium density goes up to 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| Up to 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| And it's presently zoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| Current sector plan shows it LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| Current one-year plan shows it LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| Current zoning is R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| And that allows how many units, R1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| Well, in the R1 zone, you base it on lot size and minimum lot size of 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2922)|
| 0:48:50| So depending upon if you were looking at a subdivision of R1 property, it would you'd have to subtract out roughly 20 percent for roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2930)|
| 0:48:59| So you're looking at the neighborhood of three and a half to four units per acre when all is said and done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| And in this particular case, you could base it on how big the area is, 2.2 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2944)|
| 0:49:12| And you just do the math from there times, you know, 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2952)|
| 0:49:19| So basically, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| Mayor, is there anyone here to speak on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| No one has signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| But, sir, would you like to speak to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| Rocky Smith, 4909 Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| I'm with the Rufus Smith Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| We've owned this property for approximately 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| And this density may sound a little high going to a medium density, but we've got an old duplex there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2983)|
| 0:49:51| It's kind of run down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| Mike Chase, our neighbor we spoke to, that area is kind of redeveloping and going to medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=2993)|
| 0:50:00| We had no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| Maybe the commissioners had the benefit of looking at what we were going to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| We showed that we could easily put in about 20, 22 units, all brick townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| And I think they felt like it would be quite an improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| And we had no opposition there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| We had none of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| And we feel like we'd like to have it approved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3022)|
| 0:50:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| Mayor, I think that's part of the problem is that we don't really know what they're going to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| I mean, we haven't had the advantage to see what these plans are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| And there has been some concern over the density in terms of what they're asking for versus what we could have at medium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3039)|
| 0:50:45| I think 5.9, if it's ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| Yeah, and I want to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| If it were zoned R1, you would end up pretty much with a different density than if it's PR at 5.99 or PR at 12 or 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3051)|
| 0:51:00| You multiply it by your density, the size of the acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| And it doesn't necessarily depend upon, you know, what you have in the roads and all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| You don't have to subtract it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| It's not a minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| So you get a different number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| The low end probably is going to be R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| The upper end would be at planned residential at 5.99 or PR at 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3078)|
| 0:51:26| You're saying PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| Can you clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| Is that planned residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| I was using a term there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| Councilman Gray, you still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| I think one of the concerns, and some of the neighbors have spoken to me about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| and I think a number of my colleagues are aware of the fact that Dean Hill is becoming overburdened with traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3101)|
| 0:51:48| And we have two major apartment complexes going on down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| And so I have a concern about that from a standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| Number one, the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| Number two, we haven't really had the advantage of seeing what was going to be built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| And so whether it's five units per acre or ten units per acre or 20 units, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3122)|
| 0:52:08| And basically, everything to the west is either duplexes or single-family homes that are on the, as I said, to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3128)|
| 0:52:18| To the east, we do have large tracts of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| And then further east, we do have those kind of developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| But I would feel a lot more comfortable if we postponed this until we could really see, as council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| what the plans are that they're talking about instead of just going out and saying, okay, you can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3149)|
| 0:52:36| Do we have a motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| I'd make a motion that we postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| I'll make a motion that we postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| Oh, I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| All three of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| We have to do them one at a time, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| So you're making a motion to postpone 12H, I, and J?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| For?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| For 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Can you make that 28 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| A motion to postpone for 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| We have a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| Councilman, let me get to Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| Well, I guess I'll go back to Rocky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| Can you provide some of that drawings and assure us what you all are going to build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| I mean, because there is a single family right across the street from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| And there's 1.53 parcels on the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| He'll drive us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| We've got 5.9 and 5.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| I mean, it's a pretty big jump to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| I mean, I think we'd like to just show us what you're going to do and give us some assurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| Does that give you enough time to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| It would depend on what form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| I mean, do you want us just to present it to you individually or get it to you e-mail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| I mean, whatever way you want us to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| Thirty days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| If it's not enough, we'll just postpone again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| You're comfortable with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| I just think it's that area is just you've got a railroad track there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| There's just a limited ability you can do things there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| And this way we won't tear down the old duplex and do a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| And we just really thought it was going to be a major improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| And we'd like for you all to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| Again, I don't have a problem with what it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| I just don't know what it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| So if we could see that, you know, we'd have a better understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| And I think if you'll get the information to Cindy, then she can get it to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| Councilman Del Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| As long as Buzz is here, could you tell me if the question is plan or site review or one of those other categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3277)|
| 0:54:46| is there some planned residential description or zoning that provides for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3286)|
| 0:54:52| In other words, that would allow public input on the actual plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| In other words, is there a better zone to be looking at if the goal is to accommodate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3298)|
| 0:55:05| various views on the actual proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| Well, the planned residential zone, the RP1 zone, allows that possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| It adds a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| Well, I'll take that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| It requires a site plan to be prepared and reviewed by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| And at that point in time, any, you know, a lot of things can be factored in in terms of landscaping, setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3324)|
| 0:55:33| position of the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| There's a variety of site design issues that can be addressed at that step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| That also is a public review process where because it has to come back to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| it can be reviewed in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| And at that time, people that may be affected by it can have input into that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3348)|
| 0:55:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| So RP1 would do that as opposed to a medium density like R2 or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3364)|
| 0:56:05| RP1 is the zone that I believe was recommended by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| And RP1 either at the medium density level or at 5.99, you know, it's still RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3370)|
| 0:56:18| It's just one is a higher density than the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| I was following you until I got confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| You said medium density, but I think you meant low density, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| That gets you to 5.99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| 5.99 is the low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| Ten or 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| Would have to be medium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| I think I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| Did you want to clarify something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| The zoning that we had approved at MPC has a review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| It has all those things that we have to go back before MPC and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| Both of them, I mean, we already have that, that we're going to have to do that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| I want to make sure that's clear, not just the low density, but the medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| What we've got approved has a plan review and all that that we have to go back before a public forum and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| So that's already the one we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| We have a motion and a second to postpone this, our H12H, I, and J for 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3431)|
| 0:57:18| You ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3439)|

| 0:57:22| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| 12L is an ordinance to rezone property located on the northwest side of Lantana Lane, southwest of Gap Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| from R1 to R1A, Terry Patton Applicant, 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130611?start=3454)|
