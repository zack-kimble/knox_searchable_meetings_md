| 0:02:13| We don't have a copy of the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=133)|

| 0:02:33| Would we not issue the beer permit until we've seen the actual piece of paper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=153)|
| 0:02:37| If you so designate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=157)|

| 0:07:32| Councilman Delo, it's in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=452)|

| 0:08:02| I will make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| I think that's not in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| Bob, that's in your district, but it is one half block from the district line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| and I'm very familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| They are a long time from opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=492)|

| 0:09:03| Officer Husky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| I would assume no applicable record, but as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| the prior permit was revoked for unpaid business taxes, 12-2208.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=549)|
| 0:09:19| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| We have a distance issue here with the Tyson House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| which I know actually has a history behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| Do you all have an ABC permit from the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| Like the ABC card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| An actual liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| No, we don't serve liquor at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| They are a preexisting non-conforming use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| and have not lapsed by a total of, I think, a day, day and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| Well, no, I thought the permit was revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| It was, but it didn't stay revoked long enough to be lapsed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| But it was revoked due to unpaid taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| It was revoked due to unpaid taxes, and under the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| that is not a basis for the 10-year prohibition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Have the taxes been taken care of, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=613)|

| 0:10:30| Pending vandal documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=630)|

| 0:10:34| It's complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| I thought the file was complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| I thought many hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| File is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| I wasn't listening, so my motion was correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| We're just not used to you knowing what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=640)|

| 0:10:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| I've had this light on for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=654)|

| 0:10:56| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| I thought I looked over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| Mr. Swanson, does the prior revocation on this permit have any bearing on our approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=658)|
| 0:11:07| since we don't typically encounter this in the consideration of beer permits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| I find nothing in the code that would cause that to serve as a basis for denying a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| Everything that's in the code with regard to denying a beer permit has to do with violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| and or convictions of laws related to the possession or sale of alcoholic storage of alcoholic beverages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=681)|
| 0:11:29| and does not have to do with payment of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| Just wanted to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=693)|

| 0:12:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| We have a concert series with artists that are performing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| We'd like to sell beer so that we can generate some more revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| And when are the concerts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=765)|

| 0:17:51| approval from the building inspector, fire inspector, and health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=1071)|
| 0:17:58| Is there any reason you haven't completed these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| Well, we're still in the process of putting everything together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=1080)|

| 0:18:18| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| Motion to postpone takes precedence, though, if there's that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| Well, I mean, it makes sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=1105)|

| 0:19:07| Tobacco Central is on the agenda, and they requested a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| I knew that, ESP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090728?start=1150)|
