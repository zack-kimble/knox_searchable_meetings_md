| 0:10:29| There obviously aren't venues surrounding our event like there have been in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=629)|

| 0:14:48| Now, tell us about the Bob Dylan Birthday Bash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| This is our ninth year of holding the event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| and it's a fundraiser for WDVX operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| It's a free event on Market Square that features the music of Bob Dylan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| played by local bands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=902)|

| 0:15:05| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| Councilman De La Voe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| I just know you're going to tell me that really soon we're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| the Bluegrass Festival on Market Square, and I've been waiting for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| and WDVX is the right person and group to lead the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| There's been a discussion about that, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| How can we help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| We want to see that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| Well, we'll let you know when the time comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| I'll be sure and call you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| We are in the heart of the bluegrass world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| and you guys tune out to the entire universe over the Internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| so we want to see some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| You know, we have a program, a show called the World Class Bluegrass Series.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| It's at the Bijou now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| We've had three shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| The fourth one is going to be November 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| It's been well received, and we hope to do that through 2014 and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| They'll be coming down from Virginia IA and Kentucky and, I mean, everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| And just shameless self-promotion, I mean, Iams has a metal art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| And there will be Bluegrass Acts there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| So it's an all-day festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| It's a partnership with WDVX and Iams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| Thank you for your support on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| Does that mean South Knoxville is open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| For business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| We have a move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=981)|

| 0:16:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| And, by the way, I did hear Councilman de la Vogue say that he would be considering a sizable donation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| to get this Bluegrass Festival started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| I'll keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| She has hearing issues, but that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| We'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Did he give you a tip or a pilot or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Oh, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| You've just given it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| Then we're picking winners and losers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| That's just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| The wagon wheel, you've been very patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| The wagon wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| Real patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Apparently, they got impatient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| How's that patient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| If I hear a motion to move them to the heel of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| We are at the heel, aren't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| No, we've got some other things to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1016)|

| 0:16:58| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| So there was a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1023)|

| 0:17:05| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| Now, we have a couple of other things that are on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Now, I need to find where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| Can I ask a point of reference, just a question maybe to our police officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| Under the stock and barrel, they said city court records indicate right away slash intersect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| What kind of violation is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| It's a moving violation, a failure to yield right away at an intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| I told him that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| But he's a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| I'd rather talk to the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| We have a motion to move the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1044)|

| 0:18:05| Same for Uncle Mattio's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| Is there a representative of BCI Beverages here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| Were they asked to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| Were they asked to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| They know that they were supposed to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| Is that correct, Ms. Day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| Wanda spoke with them verbally, and they got the registered mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| and indicated that they would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| Do they still not have their papers in or final?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| They do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| They do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Are they waiting inspections or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| While she's looking for them, is Uncle Matty-O's Pizza here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| Uncle Matty-O's Pizza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| They're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| We were able to pick up their permit the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| They got the requirements completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| Oh, great, because I know they've been open serving pizza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| And BCI, you're still looking for the paperwork?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| Okay, previously we had presented for consideration KJ's Mini-Martin Moore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| which will be approved in January, the final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| They had a 30-day extension in April, and this is now May the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| And the mail was returned and delivered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| and we've emailed that has since not been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| So we don't have any response from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| Do we know if they're open for other than beer service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| They're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| They're not open yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| They're having issues, I think, with handicapped restrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| or access or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| So he had construction issues to jump through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| That's what I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| I remember the gentleman, and he was having construction issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| and it was around ADA compliance or handicapped restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| I just remember that much of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| What is the will of the Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| Let's hear from Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| Well, since we haven't heard from him, but I hate to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| Is his store not open at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| I don't think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| It's not open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| Well, it sounds like after this time he's not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| Well, we have a couple of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| We can do nothing and it will die, or we can give him 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| and hopefully it shows up the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| But he did not acknowledge the mailing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| Or the email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| He's had several extensions, I believe, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| He won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| Well, I hate to give him another one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1231)|
| 0:20:38| but since he hasn't responded and we haven't heard from him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| I guess we'll just let it die out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| I think so, for lack of motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| I haven't heard from him, and I don't know what's happening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| So you want to let it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| I would just let it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| Let it lapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| Do we have a moment of silence for KJ's meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| No extension was granted for KJ's, Minimart, and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| We have a situation with Club Exile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1267)|
| 0:21:14| and I know that a representative is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| If you'll come up to the microphone, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| and while you're coming up getting ready to give us your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| just let me give you a little background on Club Exile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| You don't have any paperwork on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| This is a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| Club Exile was cited on May the 14th, 2012, for sale to an underage person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| In April of 2013, TABC levied the fine and suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1295)|
| 0:21:42| At the time of the infraction last May of 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| Club Exile complied with city of Knoxville ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| and filed a plan with KPD that this would never happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| Now comes the statute that is under trial pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1313)|
| 0:22:00| We're seeing how it works out, that if TABC cites, we have to do the same thing they did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1320)|
| 0:22:07| and if we cite, they have to do the same thing we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| It's been about a year since this statute came about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| and it's taken a long time for everybody's ducks to line up and walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| And so now we're looking at these folks who complied with the Knoxville ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| and now comes the state statute, which is, of course, supreme over our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1342)|
| 0:22:28| And so we need to refer this to a hearing officer for further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1348)|
| 0:22:35| But before we do that, I'd like this gentleman to introduce himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| and tell us what you've done, and he will have some things for you to enter into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| Give us some steps that he's taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| I'm Aaron Ellison, 11104 Samley Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1368)|
| 0:22:55| As Mr. Palmer just said, it's been over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| I was informed at the night of the citation by Tracy Hunter that probably to do what I've already done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1379)|
| 0:23:07| and it would probably be my only means of punishment or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| Anyway, the server that served the underage is no longer with Club Exile or the corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1392)|
| 0:23:21| Club Exile has door people on any busy night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| Most popular nights are Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| We ban underage over 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| We ban other risks with different color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| Mark both hands so that the bartenders will know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| One of my guidelines for all bartenders is, you know, if they look underage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| or look under 30 to ID them a second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| We have had surprise visits from beer board from disgruntled employees calling in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1434)|
| 0:24:02| Less than a month ago we had a surprise visit by beer board callers, which we passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1442)|
| 0:24:12| They were no underage drinking in the club that they found and none that I found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| They left and we was on good terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| Ms. Hunter just informed us that we passed a surprise inspection Friday night, refusing to serve the underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1461)|
| 0:24:33| We do not encourage underage patrons, but if one person has a partner that is underage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1473)|
| 0:24:43| we certainly let them in with their partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| Or, you know, if they hear about the club and want to come in, we let them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| We try to mark them very well so that, you know, their door guys mark them very well so that they will know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1492)|
| 0:25:02| ABC board gave us a 10-day suspension before they renewed our license in lieu of this citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1502)|
| 0:25:10| Myself, I've got four underage grandkids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| I can appreciate the law and, you know, the strictness on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1515)|
| 0:25:22| At Club Exile we strive to stay within the law and we train all our employees to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1522)|
| 0:25:30| You know, underage does not benefit us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1530)|
| 0:25:40| We don't sell them alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| We don't sell them beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| We don't make money off of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| But, you know, we do allow them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| If somebody brings a group and that's their designated driver, we give them free sodas for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| being a designated driver or any designated driver, we give them free soft drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| We're just having a problem keeping the door open at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| We have never really made any money at Club Exile, but we're under a lease and we can't close the doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1567)|
| 0:26:15| We hope not to have any further setbacks or fines from tonight or any time to harm our financial situation anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1575)|
| 0:26:27| But I do appreciate the strictness of underage, especially for my grandkids' sake and other kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1587)|
| 0:26:37| Well, let me say that the beer board doesn't want to harm anyone's business success either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| We're under a bit of a gun from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| And, of course, our own ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| And we have the same concerns that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| After Councilman Delevaux makes his comments, Sergeant Hunter wants to talk about this law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| and then we'll take action on your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| So if you want to wait right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| Councilman Delevaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| Mr. Ellison, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| When was the TABC's suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| How long ago was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| First of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| First of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| So that time has passed and you're back in their good graces at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| That time has passed and you're back in their good graces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| I guess I'm troubled by our interpretation of this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| It seems like when someone has been punished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| I don't understand why we can't adopt that the time served is sufficient for the suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| and it satisfies our requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| Here we are a month and a quarter later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| and it just strikes me that we're taking a second whack at the pinata.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| I don't think that's really right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| Well, I appreciate your concerns, and I share some of your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| When this trial law was passed, it was passed at the request of Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| And I think that at the state, the legislature assumed that all beer boards operate the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| And in many municipalities, the beer board is also the hearing board for cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| In the case of Knoxville, some time ago, we went in a different direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| and have hearing officers who are perhaps more grained in the law than we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| The law, I checked with Mr. Frost this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| and the law is very explicit that we have to follow, we shall follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| That was the ruling we got last time from Angela Raver, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| Can we recommend to the hearing board that they accept time served as sufficient punishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1710)|
| 0:28:38| under our own beer law so that this man has an easier go at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| Again, I think people need to toe the line and do the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| but I don't think we ought to wear them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| Well, part of the real problem is that the lapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| You know, this citation occurred in May of 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| And now April of 2013, a year later, before he actually had the suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| But now he's had the suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| But let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| And so he's taking care of our business, but in the eyes of the state law, business is not finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| Now, Sergeant Hunter, you have some light to shed on this, if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| We work very well with the Knoxville office of the ABC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| and they usually accompany us on every underage compliance check that we conduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| In March, we conducted one for St. Paddy's Day weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| and the attorney that works for them in Nashville actually came with us on this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| and we discussed the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| And since then, some of the agents from our local office has relayed some of the concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| such as the lapse in any action that is taken and the incident that's happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| and then our notification on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| That's something that they're trying to remedy right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| and some of the action that I know is pending at the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| they're trying to work it in that if they do take action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| the suspension or revocation period won't take place until such time as Knoxville's Beer Board can be notified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1798)|
| 0:30:06| and choose not to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| Brenda, may I say one thing in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| The back of the year was under guidance of General Winfrey, the state attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1815)|
| 0:30:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| That is why it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| She said for me to put it off, and they would send me a letter of when,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| because of the club not financially doing well, that she would keep in touch and guide me through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1830)|
| 0:30:38| That's why the year took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| If we have one more thing to add, then we're going to go to Mr. Frost, Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| And Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| So first, Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| I forgot to mention I've also been informed that part of the delay was some of the procedures that were in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| that have since changed, since some of their leadership has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1860)|
| 0:31:07| So instead of a delay in any citations being issued after our compliance checks are conducted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| they're actually taking action the same night as we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| That's a huge step in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Well, I realize they're ironing out the wrinkles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| Well, and then the other thing is this bill sunsets in July of 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| So we better either get the wrinkles out or hope that it's not extended into a permanent situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| That's some thoughts also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| Mr. Frost, better up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| So what brings us here is TCA 57-5-108, Section O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1901)|
| 0:31:48| Just briefly, once we receive the notice, it's a we shall schedule a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1908)|
| 0:31:56| So there's no discretion with shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| And I heard what Councilman De La Vope said about maybe sending a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| I'm not sure that that's necessary simply because we're supposed to have a hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| and this gentleman or his representatives is entitled to present evidence as well as the city law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1931)|
| 0:32:18| But the purpose of the hearing, according to the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| is to provide an opportunity for the permit holder to appear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| and show cause why the permit to sell beer on the premises should not be suspended or revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| There is no mandatory action called for other than that the hearing is allowed or this hearing shall occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1951)|
| 0:32:39| and the permit holder has the opportunity to come in and present their case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| So the hearing officer might take into account or should take into account the totality of the circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1964)|
| 0:32:51| and make the decision that he or she feels is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| Including some of the things he told us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| which were the steps he's taken to make sure that it doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| I'm sure the hearing officer will consider whatever this gentleman or his representative puts forth at the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1981)|
| 0:33:08| And again, I would encourage you to bring that document with you when you meet with the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| So when he got cited before, when they got cited before, nothing happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| Yes, something did happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| He submitted, according to our ordinance, his plan that this would never happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| That satisfied the local ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| But it did not satisfy TABC and the law as it now stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| Well, I don't understand how we can go back and, I mean, to me it's double jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| I don't get it because now we're saying that we have to follow what the state did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| Yes, that state law has precedent in the way the law is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| We led the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| That's what Nick is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| We led the way and took action, and they had to follow us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| Well, that was because they didn't have their procedures as finely tuned as they might have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| This statute works both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| I mean, if the state does something, the city is supposed to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| If the city does something first, the state is supposed to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| Didn't we do something first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| No, we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| Well, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| He submitted a plan, and then now he's back before us because the wheels of the government have moved so slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2049)|
| 0:34:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| But, okay, let's hear from Mayor Brown, and then I'll comment about all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2062)|
| 0:34:29| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| What is the location of the establishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| I didn't get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| It's 4928 Homburg Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| Homburg Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| It's not the place next to the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| Well, I think we had a similar situation like this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| That's Club Exotica.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| That's a different venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| It sounds like the people have been punished twice, but maybe we'll be able to work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| That was Hannah's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| And then there was rumors, which was the hearing officer today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| All right, let me reiterate a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| The wheels of getting this plan in place have not functioned very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| There is new leadership at TABC, and they are making big strides forward, so that will help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2106)|
| 0:35:13| I think that when this goes to the hearing officer, the transcript of this meeting will be available to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| Is that correct, Ms. Mitchell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| Not verbatim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| Not verbatim, but it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| It could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| And so we need to have a recommendation from this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2127)|
| 0:35:33| It does need to go to the hearing officer, but we could attach something to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| I would move that we tack to it that this gentleman has already satisfied this body before the state took action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2138)|
| 0:35:46| and we recommend that the suspension later given by TABC be the final action in this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2146)|
| 0:35:54| and he'd be allowed to run his business the way he has tried to reform it to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| Well, that's true, but, I mean, he can take his own legal representative and present his case before them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| and they can decide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| We're just passing it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| I mean, we're not here to interpret the law or build the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| It's just what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| That's what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| That's what Rob Frost is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| That's what the law is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| Councilman Wallace will take counsel up there and present his case, and so be it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| We're not hurting him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| We're not hurting him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| We don't have any control over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| Vice Mayor Fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Well, we don't have, and I understand we don't have control over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| but I would assume that if we as a beer board sent an overwhelming recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2196)|
| 0:36:44| or a unanimous recommendation, that that hearing officer is going to pay attention to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2204)|
| 0:36:50| I mean, again, you know, the slow wheels of government has not worked in this instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2210)|
| 0:36:57| It hadn't worked in the other instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| And, I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| Why do we have to opt into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| We did not have an option to opt into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| There were six cities in the state of Tennessee that were selected for this trial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| joint TABC local beer operation enforcement of laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| and we were one of the six that came into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| But we, you know, it may be extended in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| It may go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| It might depend on what kind of feedback they get from the beer boards that have been affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| Well, being pretty familiar with how it works in Nashville, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| they may have made that law and asked for pilots, and we would be a pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| And with that same option, you have the ability to opt out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| So, I mean, I would hope, Mr. Frost, well, with the board's approval that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| unless there's been significant changes, and it sounds like there's been some changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| but to keep doing this I think makes us, it really bogs this board down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| It makes us look indecisive, and I think it's bad policy for us to keep going down this route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2286)|
| 0:38:13| But, Mr. Frost, if you would find that out for sure, if it's a pilot or . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| It is a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| It's to terminate July 1, 2014, unless extended by the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2299)|
| 0:38:25| And it's specifically, the legislation specifically targets locations within the population brackets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2305)|
| 0:38:35| So it's one of those deals that they do with other pieces of legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| I would call for the motion that we make a recommendation to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| He can hear it or ignore it, but at least he'll have the benefit of our thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| Is there a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| There was a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| Oh, there's already a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| The motion is to make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| Just to make a recommendation to the hearing officer that the Beer Board is satisfied with the action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| that has already been taken and that the TABC would be the final action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2346)|
| 0:39:12| No additional sanctions would be levied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| So you will go to the hearing officer, but the hearing officer will have the understanding that we think you may have had enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2360)|
| 0:39:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| Give this to . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| Give this to Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| On BCI beverages, we extended it 30 . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| We didn't vote on extending BCI beverages 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| You asked us what they were lacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| The only thing the file is lacking is fire prevention approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| On BCI beverages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| So what do we want to do on BCI?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| Were they notified to be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| And they're not here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| But I would really . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| I personally would recommend another 30 days because I think there's probably a good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| They're a fairly substantial distribution center in Councilman Brown's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2405)|
| 0:40:12| So do I have a motion to extend this 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| And did the wagon wheel ever come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| I know Lee Birch, and I sent a message to him asking where he was, and he said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| one of his partners was supposed to show up, and he apologized and wanted me to express his apologies to the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| and ask for a 60-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| Sixty days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| So you're making that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| I would make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2445)|

| 0:40:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130528?start=2448)|
