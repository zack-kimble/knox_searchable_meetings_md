| 0:09:06| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| We're waiting on the sales tax registration, certificate of zoning, task program certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| and a final business tax return from the former business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=552)|
| 0:09:21| Councilman Marotti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| Mr. Chairman, normally I would defer to the councilman from this district, but since he's not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| I guess I feel like I need to express my concern that the applicant has not been through the task certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| and I would lean toward postponing this toward the next regularly scheduled billboard meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| But I'd like to hear from my colleagues since Vice Mayor Brown is not here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| Second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| You've heard it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Can I speak for Vice Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=592)|
| 0:09:58| Chairman Hall, will you address the applicant and see if he understands what we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| Do you understand what we're talking about, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| The task certification, that you need to go and have that done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| and there's been a motion made to postpone it to the next billboard meeting to give you time to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=611)|
| 0:10:18| In addition to a number of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| Yeah, in addition to several other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| The billboard just generally feels that that's really important that you and your servers understand the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| and correct serving so that underage people aren't served, and that's just really, really important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=628)|
| 0:10:34| So we'd like to see that completed before we issue the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=634)|
| 0:10:40| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=640)|

| 0:12:00| I just want to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| We had moved that previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| Yeah, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| That had been deferred once before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| Have you all heard anything from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| No, I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| We have heard they wish to withdraw, but we cannot get it in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| That would be in Councilman Brown's end of that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| We know if there's a place in there operating now, a business currently operating at that address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=749)|

| 0:12:35| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=755)|

| 0:13:34| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| The only thing we're waiting on is the actual ABC license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| And the applicant has a letter from the ABC saying the license has been approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| but he does not have the final signed-off license in his hand yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=824)|
| 0:13:53| If I may address that, I have reviewed the letter that she refers to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| and it does say that he's done everything he's supposed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| and they are, in fact, going to issue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| It's a matter of administrative procedure of them issuing the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| So it seems to me you're in a position similar to the positions where simply an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| administrative act needs to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| And if you feel that it's appropriate to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| I think it would be an appropriate time to move to approve it subject to final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| providing that the actual certificate is provided to Ms. Martin before it is issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=861)|
| 0:14:29| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| I move just that, that we approve it subject to final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| including the final issuance of the ABC permit and the appropriate documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| Second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=882)|

| 0:15:18| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| I've not received fingerprints on three of the owners who appear to be out of state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| We're waiting on approval from the building inspector, fire inspector, and health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=926)|
| 0:15:33| Ma'am, you raised your hand as if you wanted to respond to Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=933)|
| 0:15:39| Please do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| I asked when I was in a task class, I asked the teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| He said that's fine because the other three, they're not coming to operate in the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=946)|
| 0:15:53| They just stay in Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| And the other three stay in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| We all got the record check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| Ma'am, my office doesn't teach that class, so that wouldn't have been one of us three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=962)|
| 0:16:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| Okay, I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| Yeah, let me, Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| My understanding is that the three Georgia owners sent in something from police departments in Georgia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=976)|
| 0:16:22| but they didn't get fingerprinted there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| And that's really the issue that they did half of what they needed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| So they can get fingerprinted in Georgia and send that up to you with the records they've already got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| or another copy of them and doing a good check, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| They sent the background checks from Georgia, but they didn't send any fingerprints with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| which our application requires them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| Ma'am, do you understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| Then I move that we postpone this until the September billboard meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1014)|

| 0:18:59| This extra packet from Tapatios, is that an add by motion or did I just miss it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| I think that's something that Ms. Martin is going to go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1147)|

| 0:19:10| We didn't have to have it on the agenda that went in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| But they were bringing them back to you because they did get their ABC license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1154)|

| 0:19:57| They were approved subject to final documentation at the May 20th meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| and their time is running out, and we would like to request an additional period of time for them to meet the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1202)|
| 0:20:13| Councilwoman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1213)|

| 0:21:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| Is there any further action we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| I would recommend that they be approved subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| Oh, approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1288)|

| 0:21:34| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| Yeah, question for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| This wasn't on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| Can we approve it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| I mean, we had deferred this to next September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| Are we procedurally allowed to approve this here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| And do we need to do anything to make sure we're allowed to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| I think it would be wise to simply vote to add to vote to add it to the agenda before you vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1315)|
| 0:22:02| I think that would clear up the question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| But all of the notice and the required legal publish and all that occurred with the first application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| So we're good on the rest of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| In that case, I will remove my motion at this time and add this to the agenda for this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1334)|
| 0:22:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1344)|

| 0:22:37| We have to move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1357)|

| 0:23:03| We did that when we first went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| I don't have her stuff with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1385)|

| 0:24:37| Don't mark it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1477)|
| 0:24:47| You're here because you've had 200 sales to minors and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1487)|
| 0:24:58| present us with a plan of what you intend on doing to prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| this from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| My plan for preventing this from happening in the future is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1503)|
| 0:25:11| retrain all employees at point of sale purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| I have installed a point of sale machine which has to have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1517)|
| 0:25:24| birth date physically keyed into the machine before it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| accept a beer purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| I have my employees have all been trained through the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| department's training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| I have them to sign a piece of paper and write the birth date of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1541)|
| 0:25:52| the person purchasing the beer and compare it to a calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| date that's on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| I'm embarrassed to be in front of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| I'm humiliated to be in front of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| I've been in business 25 years and the human error, it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1570)|
| 0:26:21| ineptitude of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| They've carded in each one of these instances and just misread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1584)|
| 0:26:31| the ID and put them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| One of them was a 10-year employee that lives in a community and has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1596)|
| 0:26:46| done a lot for the community as far as preventing underage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| drinking, alcohol, purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| I myself have prevented many instances of underage purchases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1617)|
| 0:27:04| of alcohol, tobacco products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| It's very important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| I have a good reputation in the community as far as I've never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1631)|
| 0:27:18| had a complaint from anyone in the community on my 25-year record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1638)|
| 0:27:27| I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| It bogs my mind at how you can't read an ID and get the date and how this happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1649)|
| 0:27:37| I've gone over it and over it, and it's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| I stress it with each employee that has that job on a weekly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| if not daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| Be sure and watch your IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| This is important to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| I've taken every step that I know how to try to prevent this from happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| and just that human error factors, I just can't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1680)|
| 0:28:08| I'm here to work and do what the board would require of me to do to try to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1688)|
| 0:28:16| prevent this from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| It is interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| On the sheet we got from the police department, both the things you recited for was carded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1702)|
| 0:28:28| and it's completely believable that people misread them occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| When did you get the new machine where you have to key in the birth date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| When did you install that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| It's been about six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| I don't have the exact date of that, but it requires you to key in the birth date of the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1720)|
| 0:28:49| and for that type of purchase it will not allow it to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| Is this letter here, it's not signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| Did you write this letter, the August 5th letter here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| That was written by my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| But it's from you or the ownership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| We are both owners in the business and operate the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| We have for the entire time we've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| The record that we have in front of us as far as citation history, the 5-10-06 and the 2-13-08,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1768)|
| 0:29:39| the two sales to underage, but I guess in response to the 5-10-06,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1779)|
| 0:29:47| it was heard in front of this bureau board on November 21st of 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| and was sent on for a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| There was a five-day suspension that resulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| I'm just wondering, officer, maybe you can help me with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1800)|
| 0:30:06| Normally this board would not have sent it on for a single citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| So were there other citations prior to that that aren't listed or in front of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| There was one prior to the May 10th, 06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| And what was the date on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| 2-13-09.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1822)|
| 0:30:28| I'll tell you in just a second here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1828)|
| 0:30:53| Do you remember the gentleman that we had with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| Give me just a second here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| I'll look it up real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1860)|
| 0:31:14| The total going back here, I've got February 9th, 2001 was one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| May 15th, 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| December 18th, 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1884)|
| 0:31:32| That would have been the one before that one, it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| December 18th, 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| And then May 10th, 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| In that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1899)|
| 0:31:47| 2001, 2002, 2004, 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| And then, of course, the most recent, February 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1913)|
| 0:32:02| Clearly there was a time when this board felt it appropriate to send it on to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1922)|
| 0:32:09| So it was given some weight of seriousness then, obviously, to take that action after a history of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1929)|
| 0:32:32| It does appear, though, that there have been not quite two years since the last, between the last two citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1952)|
| 0:32:48| It sounds like Mr. Doan is very serious about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| At the same time, we have to be serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1971)|
| 0:32:58| There is a pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| I mean, there's a history, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| There's a pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| There's certainly a history of this establishment of violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| I know this board has taken the action of sending on for suspension revocation for similar infractions in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=1990)|
| 0:33:25| I see a couple other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| I'll wait and see what they have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| I want to ask Mr. Swanson if he could, for the record, give us an explanation of what's presented to us before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2011)|
| 0:33:40| And is any of this other information relative to our decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| Well, the really only relevant information for making a decision on this case is the two instances that you have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2025)|
| 0:33:52| The previous instances have been dealt with and he has gone through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| And you could not base additional punishment on those for which he has already faced punishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2037)|
| 0:34:03| The issue that you have before you are the two that are in the packet that you received tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Well, thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| I guess, Mr. Wilkes, I share a little bit this concern of there seems to have been a problem that's been ongoing for a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2054)|
| 0:34:22| I think what's different is the purchasing the machines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| saying clearly that we're going to have a machine to help prevent people from misreading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| I'm inclined to let this go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| And if we get another response, I'd feel very serious about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| But at this point, I think he is dealing seriously with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| I think Mr. Becker and I were having the same thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| So I'll just say it is, it's frightening him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| But at this point, I just need to state that I have the same feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| I think this is a good move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| I think this will assist him in having more compliance with his employees and making them more serious about it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2098)|
| 0:35:06| And I would like to give him a shot at it, so to speak, to see if this will solve his problems there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2106)|
| 0:35:13| That's a difficult location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| Well, every location is difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| I do hear what you were both saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| I guess I tend to lean that way, but only because of the new technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2121)|
| 0:35:30| Sort of one more chance in my mind to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| But I would say that if it comes back again, if this establishment comes back again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2134)|
| 0:35:41| it would be very difficult, very, very difficult to not take more stringent action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2141)|
| 0:35:48| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| I was just going to say, Council, may or may not remember a year or so ago we had a zoning situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| Oh, I remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| With these same people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| And they did, they kept their word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| They did exactly what they said they would tell this council to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| So, you know, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| Councilman Roddick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| I'm in agreement with the SPHERE Board this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| I just want to emphasize for you and for all of us that the machine is a great improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| but it certainly still doesn't remove the element of human error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| Misread a license and make a sale or misread a license and key in the wrong date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| You know, the ongoing training of your employees is obviously paramount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| Well, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| Spring Hill Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2198)|
| 0:36:51| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| I'm Kelly Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| I'm with the Knox County Bar here at 800 South Gay Street representing Spring Hill Market tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| We're here because there have been two underage sales to minors and present us with a plan of what you intend on doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2222)|
| 0:37:09| to prevent that from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| And I thank you for the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| I would like to just briefly give a little bit of background, and I know that the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| all of the board members are familiar with the two citations at this particular establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| The first one was actually handed to my client, Mr. Ruptan's mother, who was helping out at the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2245)|
| 0:37:35| That one was disposed of in the General Sessions Court by, I believe, a judicial diversion plea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2255)|
| 0:37:42| A second citation was issued back in February, as you know, to Miss Patel, who also works at the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2262)|
| 0:37:51| That case was actually ultimately dismissed without terms in the General Sessions Court on June 12th of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2271)|
| 0:37:59| I would point out that since that February citation, and let me back up just a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| certainly Spring Hill Market and Mr. Kumar Ruptan don't use that dismissal as some sort of a way out to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2285)|
| 0:38:13| They take very seriously these two violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| I just mention it as a matter of procedural history in the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| But that citation was issued in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| At that particular time, that employee, Miss Patel, had not been to the training school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| She has since been, and I've attached a copy of her certificate of achievement in that class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2307)|
| 0:38:34| Even though the first citation was issued to Miss Ruptan, Mr. Ruptan's mother, she no longer works at the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2314)|
| 0:38:42| but she herself went to the training class as well for the short time period that she continued to work in the market after the citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2322)|
| 0:38:50| There have been no further citations issued since February, a pretty considerable period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2330)|
| 0:38:57| And as I've mentioned in the letter that the remedial plan that I passed to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| and I mention it again that Miss Patel did take the server class, successfully completed that server class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2343)|
| 0:39:12| All of the employees, there is another employee, Lisa Moore, who is scheduled for the class this coming Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2352)|
| 0:39:18| So all of the employees at Spring Hill Market will have been through the class and certified by this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2358)|
| 0:39:25| All of the employees, however, have been repeatedly, I don't want to say scorned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2365)|
| 0:39:32| but reminded of the importance of checking IDs over and over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| Obviously, the signage is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| The proper signage is there at the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| They also have in place not something that's connected to the cash register itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| but they have one of those calendar systems there that every morning you take it off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| and it shows what age you have to be on that certain day, which I understand there's an element of human error there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| Somebody could forget to take it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| I guess it's the same, perhaps a similar element of human error in the carting system that you hook up to the cash register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2402)|
| 0:40:12| But Mr. Roopchand comes here tonight willing to take any advice or recommendations on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| I wouldn't say, at least in the two years that Mr. Roopchand has owned this business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| that it's been a repeated violation, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| But he has warned his employees that termination would result from any prior violations of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2427)|
| 0:40:35| which I think is about the most strict that he can get on his employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| His goal, however, of course, and I think the goal of this board is to make sure that it doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| I mean, that's why we're all here and that's why we have these ordinances in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2445)|
| 0:40:52| Again, I think what I'd like to stress to the board, just one more time without beating a dead horse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2452)|
| 0:40:58| is that there are things that are in place now that weren't in place before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| There is still that element of human error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| Mr. Roopchand has several different businesses that he's involved with but is indirectly in control of this business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2466)|
| 0:41:16| and takes serious his responsibilities, especially as to the issue of underage drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| Underage, you know, anybody who can obtain this from his market, I mean, that's not something that he wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| both as a Knox Countian, as a business owner, and just as a father in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2486)|
| 0:41:33| He's willing to take any steps that he possibly can to make sure that this doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| You just said there are lots of things in place that weren't in place when the violation happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| When I was listening to you, I didn't hear anything different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| It was sort of now we're repeatedly telling our employees not to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| I mean, it seems like all you're doing different is maybe a little more of what you were doing before that wasn't working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2513)|
| 0:42:00| So tell me what you're doing different now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| I think that the system, the calendar system, wasn't perhaps being stressed enough at the time of the violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2523)|
| 0:42:13| or prior to the violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| Those issues in terms of training on that system and the importance have been stepped up personally by Mr. Roopchand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2535)|
| 0:42:22| Now, Ms. Patel essentially manages the store, and I have counseled Mr. Roopchand that he needs to manage the store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2542)|
| 0:42:32| and she is actually on the beer permit now, but that it's his ultimately responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2552)|
| 0:42:39| And so the calendar system, I think, has been set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| And then the increase, and I understand where your concerns would be, but the increase in that personally from Mr. Roopchand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2564)|
| 0:42:52| to every employee, not just in the training when they're just hired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| but in the constant reminding of this is extraordinarily important to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2577)|
| 0:43:04| It's extraordinarily important to Mr. Roopchand personally and extraordinarily important to his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2584)|
| 0:43:13| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| I have to agree with my colleague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| It doesn't sound like an additional process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| It just sounds like you're telling people to try harder, and that makes me nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| That doesn't, and even your statement about you're open to new ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2609)|
| 0:43:36| I need for you to be thinking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| And I'm just not, I'm not seeing what you've written here or what I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| I don't see a change in plan, a process that's any different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2624)|
| 0:43:50| It makes me uncomfortable that you're just telling people to try harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| And I understand if I could address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| I have talked to Mr. Roopchand about the possibility of putting one of those systems in place where he,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2637)|
| 0:44:06| they physically have to put in the, into the cash register the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| Of course, there is, again, as the council has brought out tonight, there is an element of human error in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| And, in fact, my understanding from the citation in February was that it was missed as a matter of human error by one day on the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2656)|
| 0:44:25| I didn't see the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| I can't verify that, but it does make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| So I guess what I'm suggesting to the board is that with those concerns that we understand that Mr. Roopchand understands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2669)|
| 0:44:36| I think that he could probably come back to this board with a showing that that has been put into place on the cash register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2676)|
| 0:44:46| And beyond that and the constant supervision from him and from the store manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2686)|
| 0:44:54| there's always an element of human error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| But it's just I have stressed to him for so many reasons that it's just in this day and age it's unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2697)|
| 0:45:04| We've got to correct the problem in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| And I can assure the board that he is willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| Mr. Johnson, my host.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| Mr. Johnson, when did Ms. Patel, I guess it's Ms. Patel, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2716)|
| 0:45:23| Ms. Patel, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| When did Ms. Patel begin working in that position or in that store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| That if I could defer to Mr. Roopchand on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2729)|
| 0:45:37| He's telling me about a year and a half or two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| He bought the store approximately two years ago, so it would have been shortly after that, I think, that she came on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2741)|
| 0:45:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| So what I'm seeing then is the he was cited for sale to an underage, 9-19-07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2748)|
| 0:46:03| And then he went through the task program, got his certificate after that, 11-29-07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2763)|
| 0:46:11| She was apparently already working there, but was not required to go through the task program until after she sold, was cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2771)|
| 0:46:21| He could have made sure that all those people selling went through the task program as soon as the first citation happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2781)|
| 0:46:30| which to me would have been the prudent thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2790)|
| 0:46:36| I share my colleagues' concerns based on this information about how there wasn't much emphasis put on the task program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2796)|
| 0:46:45| until someone was cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| Only then do they go through the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| The lack of new systems, the proximity of the two dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2810)|
| 0:46:57| They're less than six months apart for the two citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| I'm going to make a motion that we send this on to a suspension ratification hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| Now, I was going to ask, but is this the former Sutt's Market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| It's north of the B&D Rib Shack?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| Yeah, Rutledge Pike, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| But, I mean, it hadn't been that long since there's been the change of ownership under this beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2842)|
| 0:47:29| I thought it had been about two years, approximately two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| I didn't pull the other beer permit, so I'm not sure of the exact dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| We have a motion and a second on the floor to send them to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| Is there any other business that needs to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| We'll get a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080826?start=2883)|
