|      52 |    54 | So I'm going to just jump into the data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=52.0)   |
|      54 |    56 | and get through the presentation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=54.0)   |
|      56 |    57 | so we can have a conversation,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=56.0)   |
|      57 |    62 | because I think it's a pretty big topic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=57.0)   |
|      62 |    64 | So I'd like to start off these presentations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=62.0)   |
|      64 |    68 | just with where are we right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=64.0)   |

|      87 |    90 | To Knoxville, it's gone, and I'll show you why.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=87.0)   |

|      93 |    96 | in the housing market, and I will get into that as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=93.0)   |
|      96 |    98 | So just looking, I like to start these off                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=96.0)   |
|      98 |   101 | with some just general economic trends,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=98.0)   |
|     101 |   103 | because housing is the business cycle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=101.0)  |
|     103 |   105 | They're intimately related.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=103.0)  |
|     105 |   107 | So just looking at our economy as a whole,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=105.0)  |
|     107 |   111 | this is showing real inflation-adjusted economic growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=107.0)  |
|     111 |   115 | So you can see in 2021 and 2022, we had very strong growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=111.0)  |
|     115 |   118 | And do note that in 2022,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=115.0)  |

|     348 |   353 | So, again, this is not a COVID trend per se.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=348.0)  |
|     353 |   356 | It is a long-term trend that we're seeing happening                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=353.0)  |
|     356 |   359 | that was definitely exacerbated by COVID.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=356.0)  |
|     360 |   362 | And so looking at the regional listing price,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=360.0)  |
|     362 |   366 | so this is just the median price of listings that are on the market,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=362.0)  |
|     366 |   367 | so not sold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=366.0)  |
|     367 |   370 | But you can see here, throughout all of our history,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=367.0)  |
|     370 |   372 | we've had a price premium in our housing market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=370.0)  |
|     372 |   374 | It's been cheaper to move here,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=372.0)  |
|     374 |   376 | add on that we don't have a state income tax.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=374.0)  |
|     376 |   378 | It's a really affordable place to live.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=376.0)  |
|     378 |   380 | It's really great for remote workers,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=378.0)  |
|     380 |   382 | but it's great for business as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=380.0)  |
|     382 |   385 | But we've seen that change dramatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=382.0)  |
|     385 |   388 | So you see the national median listing price started to fall                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=385.0)  |

|     761 |   764 | This is our estimate of the housing shortage for the metro area,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=761.0)  |
|     764 |   767 | so this is not just Knox County.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=764.0)  |
|     767 |   773 | Obviously, a huge percentage of this shortage is in Knox County.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=767.0)  |
|     773 |   777 | We don't do a particular estimate because of some limitations in the data,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=773.0)  |
|     777 |   780 | but basically what this is showing you is our estimate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=777.0)  |

|     794 |   800 | It's just looking at if we want to maintain the affordability that we've had previously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=794.0)  |
|     800 |   806 | So if we thought that what we've had over the pre-2010 era,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=800.0)  |

|    1117 |  1123 | Something that's interesting, the white-black homeownership gap in the Knoxville metro area is 30 points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1117.0) |
|    1123 |  1132 | And what is interesting is that the black homeownership rate is lower than the state and national average,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1123.0) |
|    1132 |  1136 | and that is also true of every other minority group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1132.0) |
|    1136 |  1140 | They're all lower than the state and national average in Knoxville,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1136.0) |
|    1140 |  1144 | in part because we're generally a little bit more urban,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1140.0) |
|    1144 |  1150 | and that tends to be the case, but our overall homeownership rate is higher than the state and national average.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1144.0) |
|    1150 |  1156 | So there's significant disparities, and part of that is unequal access to mortgage credit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1150.0) |
|    1156 |  1164 | This is not necessarily discrimination per se, but it is institutioned not having credit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1156.0) |

|    1172 |  1175 | which I think is going to be a really great thing for access to mortgages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1172.0) |
|    1175 |  1178 | But this is for Knox County.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1175.0) |
|    1178 |  1185 | Looking at denial rates, black and Hispanic borrowers are denied at twice the rate of white borrowers and Asian borrowers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1178.0) |
|    1185 |  1189 | So it is a big disparity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1185.0) |
|    1189 |  1198 | The big important point, though, is how these disparities largely are born because of income disparities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1189.0) |
|    1198 |  1205 | And what is really important to note is how affordability challenges limit access to high-opportunity areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1198.0) |
|    1205 |  1213 | So I think you guys can all relate that some of the places where people most want to live when a new housing development is proposed there                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1205.0) |
|    1213 |  1217 | is where it's most vigorously opposed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1213.0) |
|    1217 |  1220 | You see it in rezoning after rezoning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1217.0) |
|    1220 |  1225 | That tends to be the case, but it has the effect of locking different people out of those areas,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1220.0) |

|    1240 |  1250 | So it's not necessarily a racial thing so much as access to high-opportunity areas, social networks, social capital, and things of that nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1240.0) |
|    1250 |  1255 | What you see is that black borrowers are nearly twice as likely to purchase in a low-income area,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1250.0) |
|    1255 |  1262 | and a whopping 28% of mortgage applications from black applicants are in low-income areas,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1255.0) |
|    1262 |  1266 | whereas when you see in the white applicants, it's much more balanced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1262.0) |
|    1266 |  1269 | You also see this show up in the Hispanic population.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1266.0) |
|    1269 |  1277 | The Asian population is sort of an outlier here where almost a quarter of their applications are in high-income areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1269.0) |
|    1277 |  1279 | So it's not strictly a racial issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1277.0) |
|    1279 |  1287 | It's more of an issue of access to different opportunity areas and where we build housing and where affordable housing is located.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1279.0) |
|    1287 |  1295 | So we think, and based on our report, we believe that housing demand over the next decade is going to be strong,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1287.0) |
|    1295 |  1297 | and here's a couple of points why.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1295.0) |
|    1297 |  1302 | So this is showing the distribution of our metro population by generation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1297.0) |

|    1307 |  1313 | Millennials are aging into their prime home buying year, so younger millennials are buying for the first time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1307.0) |

|    1356 |  1362 | We predominantly in East Tennessee build three-bedroom, two-bathroom houses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1356.0) |
|    1362 |  1368 | I would argue that young millennials can't afford and don't want a three-bedroom, two-bathroom house,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1362.0) |
|    1368 |  1375 | and that might also be the case for baby boomers who can't afford and don't want a big house with a yard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1368.0) |

|    1490 |  1492 | than are leaving Knoxville to go to Nashville.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1490.0) |
|    1492 |  1495 | So we're starting to reverse some historic trends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1492.0) |
|    1495 |  1502 | But it's also important to know that regional population growth is almost exclusively being driven by migration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1495.0) |
|    1502 |  1508 | More people have died than were born in the past two years in our metro area,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1502.0) |
|    1508 |  1513 | and so all of the population growth that we've seen is virtually by migration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1508.0) |

|    1536 |  1548 | I'm very proud of myself because our NAR chief economist put out a forecast specific to a couple of the top metros in the country for 2023,                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1536.0) |

|    1735 |  1736 | Thank you, Madam Chair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1735.0) |
|    1736 |  1740 | Thank you for another great housing report and lots of data to digest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1736.0) |
|    1740 |  1742 | Some new stuff as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1740.0) |
|    1742 |  1744 | It's really interesting to me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1742.0) |
|    1744 |  1750 | Back on slide 12, you talked about the housing inventory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1744.0) |
|    1750 |  1761 | Do you have any data on that's just-in-time inventory, but how often things turn over?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1750.0) |
|    1761 |  1766 | I mean, single family homes, condos, suburbs, urban.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1761.0) |
|    1766 |  1776 | I mean, some of that available inventory could potentially free up if it gets out of the freeze zone or your frozen sort of section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1766.0) |
|    1776 |  1781 | But do you have a sense of what turns over when and how?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1776.0) |
|    1781 |  1790 | And ultimately what I'm getting to is are there policies that-for instance, you talked about the one person in the house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1781.0) |
|    1790 |  1794 | My neighbor is one person in a house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1790.0) |

|    1816 |  1818 | We don't have great data on turnover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1816.0) |
|    1818 |  1826 | So we do have like a high-level statistic that is just the average number of years that people stay in their house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1818.0) |
|    1826 |  1836 | And Knoxville is actually one of the lowest in the country in terms of people are-the average number of years people stay in their house is actually really low in Knoxville.                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1826.0) |
|    1836 |  1840 | I think it's sort of a deceiving statistic because we've had so many.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1836.0) |

|    1860 |  1864 | I mean, that has grown exponentially.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1860.0) |

|    1878 |  1892 | I mean, today, in today's Compass, there was a significant article about just the amount of population growth that has happened so quickly that I think all of us were kind of caught off-not off guard, but we're like continuously impressed with it.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1878.0) |

|    1896 |  1907 | There's actually some really good survey data on Knoxville renters in particular just looking at average income, and we've seen over the past five years that more high-income households are choosing to rent.                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1896.0) |
|    1907 |  1912 | So historically speaking, the average renter income has been fairly low.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1907.0) |
|    1912 |  1919 | So it's been, in Knoxville in particular, has been lower-income residents, but it's growing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1912.0) |
|    1919 |  1922 | So more high-income households are choosing to rent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1919.0) |
|    1922 |  1929 | And so it's people who are just merely choosing to rent, whether they own investment properties, I don't know, but they're choosing to rent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1922.0) |
|    1929 |  1932 | We're also seeing that average age grow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1929.0) |
|    1932 |  1935 | So people later in life are choosing to rent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1932.0) |
|    1935 |  1942 | So the big shift in our rental market in particular is that higher-income households are choosing to rent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1935.0) |
|    1942 |  1950 | And alternatively, we're also seeing migration from areas where it's more common to rent and the hassles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1942.0) |
|    1950 |  1955 | And some people think that owning a home is a hassle, particularly if you're from a big city.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1950.0) |
|    1955 |  1962 | And as we attract more people from big cities, we're just naturally going to see our rental rate rise, generally speaking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1955.0) |
|    1962 |  1965 | But we do have a really shifting rental market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1962.0) |
|    1965 |  1975 | Lastly, we're also seeing typically the student housing market is really different from the rest of the rental market                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1965.0) |
|    1975 |  1982 | to the extent that you rent out bedrooms in the student market as opposed to entire units.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1975.0) |
|    1982 |  1987 | We're seeing a lot more students seep into the private rental market, particularly downtown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1982.0) |
|    1987 |  1993 | Obviously, that is related to students not being able to find housing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1987.0) |
|    1993 |  1997 | Will that continue to be the case as we see more student housing?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1993.0) |
|    1997 |  2000 | It's conceivably yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=1997.0) |
|    2000 |  2009 | But we're definitely seeing a shift in terms of students seeping into what would be traditionally considered the private rental market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2000.0) |
|    2009 |  2013 | I have a couple other questions, but I'll yield for a while and come back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2009.0) |

|    2021 |  2022 | Just some questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2021.0) |
|    2022 |  2027 | We talk frequently about this because we're both kind of data nerds and we do this kind of stuff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2022.0) |
|    2027 |  2035 | But first, for the public who maybe is watching and our constituents, tell us a little bit about your position and your role                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2027.0) |
|    2035 |  2039 | and then also where the funding for your position comes from.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2035.0) |
|    2039 |  2043 | Yeah, the funding for my position comes from the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2039.0) |
|    2043 |  2051 | We're a nonpartisan trade association and represent just over 6,000 realtors across 12 counties in East Tennessee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2043.0) |
|    2051 |  2054 | So I'm employed by the realtors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2051.0) |
|    2054 |  2063 | And part of my job is advocacy to support home ownership, to support housing, the real estate industry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2054.0) |
|    2063 |  2069 | These reports, we take great care in making sure that they're as objective as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2063.0) |
|    2069 |  2074 | And so that's summary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2069.0) |
|    2074 |  2075 | That's exactly what I want.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2074.0) |
|    2075 |  2077 | I mean, a lot of people are like, Hanson's sale, okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2075.0) |

|    2080 |  2081 | We get these questions a lot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2080.0) |
|    2081 |  2086 | So I just thought, you know what, this is a good opportunity for you to just kind of explain that a little bit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2081.0) |
|    2086 |  2093 | And then, you know, we've talked about, we kind of have this conversation on loop about underbuilding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2086.0) |
|    2093 |  2098 | And so one question you and I have talked about, I've talked with Director Brooks and the county too,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2093.0) |
|    2098 |  2101 | is that, you know, realistically, what are the numbers?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2098.0) |
|    2101 |  2110 | How many units do we have that have been approved and are in the pipeline but yet not constructed?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2101.0) |
|    2110 |  2118 | Because I think that's an important piece of information for us also to consider in the conversation of we tend to be underbuilding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2110.0) |
|    2118 |  2122 | And I know that they did a great development activity report for 2022,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2118.0) |
|    2123 |  2129 | and it kind of shows that, you know, residential building permits for 2022, about 4,100.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2123.0) |
|    2129 |  2134 | We had right at 690 rezonings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2129.0) |
|    2134 |  2139 | We have approximately 1,300 new lots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2134.0) |
|    2139 |  2146 | And then going into, that's about 689 acres that was rezoned to residential.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2139.0) |
|    2146 |  2150 | And then total units, about 4,371.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2146.0) |
|    2150 |  2152 | Director Brooks, is that about right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2150.0) |

|    2528 |  2535 | That's a big question that I think if I had a great answer to, I would be paid a lot more and probably not live in Knoxville.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2528.0) |
|    2535 |  2539 | But I think we're going to continue to see.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2535.0) |
|    2539 |  2544 | I mean, the 30-year mortgage is unique globally speaking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2539.0) |
|    2544 |  2551 | Most countries in the world don't have 30-year fixed-rate mortgages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2544.0) |
|    2551 |  2557 | They don't have easy access to long-term lending to purchase a home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2551.0) |

|    2563 |  2566 | I think that's going to continue to happen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2563.0) |
|    2566 |  2575 | But what's really fundamentally important is that the Dodd-Frank and regulations coming out of 2008 have fundamentally changed our lending process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2566.0) |
|    2575 |  2581 | So the people who are getting loans are overqualified and have higher credit scores.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2575.0) |
|    2581 |  2585 | They have to prove what they have in their bank accounts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2581.0) |
|    2585 |  2591 | The future of lending is much more staple than it was 15 years ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2585.0) |
|    2591 |  2599 | And it's in part why if we were in a housing collapse, we would see people listing their houses for sale and at a price premium.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2591.0) |
|    2599 |  2603 | But homeowners aren't accepting lower home prices right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2599.0) |
|    2603 |  2610 | So I think it's important to note that if we were in sort of a shift, I think we would see more houses on the market at a lower price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2603.0) |

|    2625 |  2632 | One of your charts says that the median sale price in a house last year was $315,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2625.0) |
|    2632 |  2636 | So is that the magic number for an affordable house?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2632.0) |
|    2636 |  2639 | How do you – what is an affordable house?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2636.0) |
|    2639 |  2641 | Well, I think that's a great question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2639.0) |
|    2641 |  2648 | And so it's looking at – I think affordability is sort of a shifting target because it's not one factor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2641.0) |
|    2648 |  2654 | I mean, 350 – I mean, it's all about what kind of jobs we have.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2648.0) |
|    2654 |  2661 | If we have higher income jobs and we're seeing incomes grow, then a higher price point might be more affordable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2654.0) |
|    2661 |  2664 | But what I would say is that when we start looking at what's –                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2661.0) |
|    2664 |  2670 | I mean, and it also shifts based off of mortgage rates, which are cyclical and no one can really predict.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2664.0) |

|    2676 |  2682 | I would argue that at our current interest mortgage rates, it's probably sub-300.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2676.0) |

|    2707 |  2713 | It's really – I hate the answer of education because I think that's what we always do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2707.0) |
|    2713 |  2720 | But it really is an important and very critical part of this because a lot of it is misnomers about what it requires to purchase a home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2713.0) |

|    2732 |  2735 | Five and 3% isn't really uncommon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=2732.0) |

|    3003 |  3009 | I mean, for us, Jesse, you wrote a great article I read this morning as well that, you know, we had over 7,000 new people come through.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3003.0) |
|    3009 |  3011 | That's a good amount of people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3009.0) |
|    3011 |  3018 | And all those people need houses, and that just adds to, you know, and because people can't afford houses now, they're renting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3011.0) |
|    3018 |  3025 | There's not enough houses, so they're renting because you have on here only 15% of the people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3018.0) |
|    3025 |  3030 | You know, if 75,000 gets you 15%, that's not a lot of houses that are left for everybody left over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3025.0) |
|    3030 |  3042 | Well, and I think it's important to acknowledge that it is a supply and demand thing, but unlike most markets, we don't allow – we fix supply.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3030.0) |
|    3042 |  3051 | You know, if frosted flakes get really popular, you know, Kellogg is going to start producing a lot more frosted flakes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3042.0) |
|    3051 |  3058 | That's not really possible in the housing market in part because we regulate land use, and we do – you know, land use is an important thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3051.0) |
|    3058 |  3069 | We have to regulate it, but it's – you know, we also prohibit, you know, the builders' and developers' ability to respond to supply in a dynamic way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3058.0) |
|    3069 |  3071 | So it's not this equal market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3069.0) |
|    3071 |  3079 | We have to acknowledge the government side of we are literally regulating the extent to which we can respond supply-wise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3071.0) |
|    3080 |  3099 | To some extent, that is always, I mean, a necessary thing, but it's important just to – we sort of put our hammer down on the supply-demand thing because, you know, in many ways, regulations actually control and manipulate the supply-demand relationship.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3080.0) |
|    3099 |  3101 | I agree 100% there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3099.0) |
|    3101 |  3120 | I also like the point that, you know, I used to be able to buy a new lot to build, a quarter-acre lot for $15,000,000, $20,000,000 when I first started building here a decade ago, and now it's easily $50,000,000, $75,000,000 just to get a lot, just to build a house on, which then has to go in the carry costs and interest rates and everything else goes in. | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3101.0) |
|    3120 |  3125 | So it's – I don't – I was talking to Commissioner Oster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3120.0) |
|    3125 |  3129 | You know, the $450,000 house I used to build now goes for $800,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3125.0) |

|    3194 |  3200 | One of our neighboring counties put a moratorium on a certain type of residential development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3194.0) |
|    3200 |  3204 | What kind of impact has that had on Knox County?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3200.0) |
|    3204 |  3218 | You know, I have argued and I have been thankful for the support of Mayor Jacobs, and I think that Knox County has – it has a substantial impact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3204.0) |
|    3218 |  3229 | Blount County, to name one, is attracting Amazon and Smith & Wesson, and then trying to reduce their residential density by 80%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3218.0) |
|    3229 |  3239 | They actually succeeded in that just last week, and they also temporarily stopped cluster development, which is a form of plant-pud development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3229.0) |
|    3239 |  3245 | So it has a substantial impact, and it's in part because it's more expensive to live in Blount County than Knox County.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3239.0) |
|    3245 |  3251 | So all of the jobs that are being attracted to Blount County, a substantial portion of those people are commuting from Knoxville,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3245.0) |
|    3251 |  3256 | and I think there's some good data on that from the Knoxville-Knox County planning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3251.0) |
|    3256 |  3259 | But it's also, you know, we're not picking up on that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3256.0) |

|    3404 |  3406 | And so those are the types of things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3404.0) |
|    3406 |  3420 | We're actually in this fiscal year business plan, we're lessening our business attraction, which is the kind of external out of town marketing and focusing more on expansion,                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3406.0) |
|    3420 |  3423 | because we just have nowhere for those folks to live if they come here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3420.0) |
|    3423 |  3428 | So it's a huge impact on our business and our ability to do what we do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230522-state-of-housing?start=3423.0) |
