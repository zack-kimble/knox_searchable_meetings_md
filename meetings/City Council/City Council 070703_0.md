| 0:06:50| Recently, we've been studying food security issues, the expansion of the mobile meals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| programs, which has been quite tremendous for the last couple of years, lots of other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| And we also have an awards program that we do once a year called the 10 Carat Award to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| recognize those individuals, businesses, and organizations in Knox County schools that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=425)|
| 0:07:11| have really done what we see as a food policy council, that we want to recognize our local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=431)|
| 0:07:18| food heroes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| You have a small booklet that I put in the council packet like this that I won't take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| the time to go through, but it lists everyone that received awards this past December, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| included a city councilman's spouse as a dentist who has just done a tremendous amount of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=449)|
| 0:07:36| for that community, which was really neat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| In the back of that booklet, you'll see everyone from the year 2000 who received the 10 Carat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| You'll get invitations, as we do every year, probably in October for the one this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| So if anyone can come, we'd love to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| The last two things I wanted to mention, I put in there two things that we worked on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| this year was a report on food insecurity in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| Part of that was about homelessness, and that also included our seniors and people who it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| not necessarily the means to buy food as it is access to food and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| The other large report that we did and reported it to both mayor, city council, and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| commission and different departments in those governments is the report on food resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| In other words, how prepared is Knox County and Knoxville if there was an emergency, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=504)|
| 0:08:31| it's a bioterrorism pandemic emergency or some sort of a storm or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=511)|
| 0:08:39| As far as food is related only, how ready is Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| Both of those issues, both food security and food resources, are really things that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| going to continue to study for this next year as we worked on it and we saw opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| and things that are already in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| City council and different departments are working on making improvements, so we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| want to see how things are going and make any more recommendations for those this next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| The next thing I wanted to mention is we are actually the oldest food policy council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| We're the first one established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| About six months ago, I went to an awards situation in Nashville that Knoxville was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| recognized as not only the first food policy council in the world, but also that we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| recognized as the standard, so thank you all for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| The last thing is what we're planning to do in 2007 besides continuing food insecurity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| and food resources is working with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| Part of some suggestions that we got from Kima and the Red Cross and other folks is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| if we could put together a list of food resources in Knox County and surrounding communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| In other words, whether it's produce companies, grocery stores, food processors, large wholesale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=589)|
| 0:09:56| distributors to where if there was a situation, just to have an idea of a ballpark, what kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| of food is out there and where it is on a general basis they thought would be really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| useful if something came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| Again, if anyone can make it to our ten-period award, we'd love to have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| I just had a question, Mr. Gregg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=615)|
| 0:10:22| Some people call it a movement, the local foods movement that's becoming more prominent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| It sounds to me like there's some overlap with some of the issues that you all address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| Are you looking at that or trying to relate to that effort at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| We certainly are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| I've been to Asheville, I guess, about four times in the last three months who seems along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| those lines have been really promoting organic farming and helping farmings and restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| and grocery stores do a lot of things, working together on those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| One of the things that they have is what they call a food guide, which is basically a composite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| magazine or booklet that's available, kind of like Metropulse is around here, to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| farmers work with grocery stores and people know where they can get local-grown produce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=661)|
| 0:11:08| We're working on not necessarily us doing it, but putting together people in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| that are interested in doing something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| Just on a different note, I wanted to update people on the new sidewalk ordinance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=679)|
| 0:11:25| Fountain City Connections has been working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| I'd hope to be able to have that ready to introduce at the next meeting and would hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| out copies now and sort of give everybody plenty of notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| We had a little technical problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| Ideally, we'll get that worked out in two weeks and I'll be able to come back and hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| out copies and have it actually on the agenda a month from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| So I wanted to, everybody I know has gotten copies of that, but I want to get copies out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| in final form and get that process in the public sphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| I just wanted to sort of raise the awareness of an issue and also, ultimately, I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| work with Mr. Swanson on a resolution for the next council meeting on a situation, really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| a sort of a crisis, as I see it, out in the community where thieves are breaking in homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=723)|
| 0:12:10| and businesses and a lot of low-income housing areas and stealing raw materials like copper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=730)|
| 0:12:18| And I don't know if any of you all have seen it or heard it, but I've heard from a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| of people around the community and it's really, really a hassle and it's costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=743)|
| 0:12:30| And I want to do a resolution to sort of urge the state and federal lawmakers to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| ways that we could sort of curtail this or help prevent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| And I understand from talking to Chief Owen today that there are some things already in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| the works and I think, you know, it's almost to the point of a crisis, but these scrap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| metal dealers accept this, pay cash for it, and it's going on all around nationally, locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=770)|
| 0:12:57| And Chief Owen, would you mind, and the other thing is, is as I've talked to the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| department and the chief, it's remarkable what they've been able to do in a very short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| period of time to sort of prevent this and catch some of these people that are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| But, Chief, if you wouldn't mind to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| Well, following the phone call from Councilman Bailey, I put together some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=794)|
| 0:13:21| The Knoxville Police Department has actually created a multi-county task force to deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| with this problem because we have some facilities in some of our scrap metal yards here that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| are not available in other counties, some crushers and grinders and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| And as a result of that, our property crimes unit has brought together 30 different law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=816)|
| 0:13:43| enforcement agencies representing 11 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| They prepare a monthly newsletter, exchange information back and forth, they've established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| relationships with the scrap metal dealers, and, as was said, have been fairly successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| in identifying some of these people that are stealing copper, they're actually stealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=837)|
| 0:14:03| air conditioning coils off of air conditioning units on the roofs of commercial businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| or stealing from residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| And now, one of the big things is stealing catalytic converters out of vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| And so it is a very serious problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| And the KPD has been very aggressive in trying to establish some means by which we can deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| There is a proposed legislation that calls for a waiting period before someone can actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=867)|
| 0:14:34| be paid for something they bring to a scrap metal yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| That is in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| I don't have all the details, but I'm told that is in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| And the KPD has been a leader in this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| So it's a national problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| It's something that's happening all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| I received a phone call from Tampa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| They were having the same problem, but at a much larger scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| No, I just, especially in some of the lower income areas, they go in through these alleys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| and they go in the basements and just rip people's plumbing apart and steal this copper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| and take off with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| And it costs these folks a lot of money to repair their plumbing, and a lot of them can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| And it's hard to get the timber in there, and it's, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| So I just wanted to bring that up and ultimately pass this along to our lawmakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Let me say I agree wholeheartedly with what Councilman Bates just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| He actually contacted me about hearing about an issue of this nature in my district, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| I told him it is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| My business actually was vandalized in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| And also, we've had some issues out in the Mechanicsville area, so I would wholeheartedly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| support us trying to see if we can put a resolution together, maybe to send it to the state or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| somebody to look at what we need to do with regards to these individuals who are purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| this copper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| You know, it's hard for me to believe that a person who pulls up with $14,000 or $15,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| or $16,000 worth of copper in their trunk and brings it to somebody to sell, they think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| they just, you know, manufactured that and bought it for sale, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| So someone somewhere knows that it wasn't found on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| So maybe we can move along those lines, and I appreciate him bringing it up and look forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| to hopefully trying to develop at least a resolution, which I know it doesn't have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| force of law, but maybe we can at least alert our legislators to the issue and the concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| because I know it is a prevalent issue in my district, especially in some of the historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| areas that people are beginning to rebuild houses and homes, and they look up, and every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| time they look up, somebody is stealing these raw materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| So I look forward to entering into that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| I was going to say KPD was instrumental in recovering some copper guttering from Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| The way the current city ordinance is written, you have to present a state-issued ID in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| to, you know, be able to recycle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| And, Chief Hinton, doesn't the material have to be set aside for a certain period of time before it can be recycled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1010)|
| 0:16:57| No, that's part of what the proposed legislation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| But at least you do have to submit ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| You have to submit ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| And now we're trying to get everyone to take a picture of the person bringing the materials in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| along with the materials they're bringing in, to help identify exactly what belongs to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| Could it be structured like how the pawn shops operate, where they have to turn in, you know, on disk every so often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1036)|
| 0:17:24| who brings in what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| We're working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| But, as you might expect, that encompasses some additional costs and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| But we are working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| How were you able to --?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| I believe, wasn't it yesterday that the arrest of two people was publicized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1056)|
| 0:17:43| Is that some of the efforts you're making, or was it just a bumble job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| I'm not exactly sure which one you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| I think I was looking at Channel 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| But I recall a young man and a young woman that were involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| I know we have gotten a lot of warrants recently, and some people we've found, some we have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| That's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| Councilman Hulkus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| I believe that the city has been hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| I think the South Knoxville Recreation Center was hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| And for a few hundred dollars' worth of copper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| they did thousands and thousands of dollars' worth of damage to the HVAC units on the roof of that city center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| So it has some very practical implications to our taxpayers in that sense, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1102)|
| 0:18:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Before we go on, I want to recognize a few significant occasions recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| I want to congratulate Dr. and Mrs. Pelow on 50 years of marriage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| Mrs. Pelow had a birthday a couple of weeks before that, so she's had a big month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| And congratulate Sam Anderson on his 55th birthday yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| It might have been 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| Thank you for not giving out my number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| We'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Catch up with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| Also, congratulations to the marriage of your son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1150)|

| 0:22:52| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| Yeah, Mayor, I just wanted to say I'm pleased that David is going to be under contract again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| and we've had several meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| Mayor, you've been in them, Sam, and Steve in engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| and there's been a number of things discussed as was in the report that we passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| And this process of going through David working with the neighborhoods, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| is going to really lead to some good things that the neighborhoods themselves can work with us on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1399)|
| 0:23:26| to sort of identify neighborhoods as people go into them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| And so I just want David to come up here for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| I know we've got a short meeting here, but lots of people have worked long and hard on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1415)|
| 0:23:42| and I'm determined that we try to impact speeding in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| And David sat in on all the meetings and was very supportive of what we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1427)|
| 0:23:53| and I just wanted you to tell the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| and anybody listening sort of what you plan on implementing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| Well, thank you, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| Don't laugh, Steve, you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| This contract is actually a replica of the contract we had last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| where the community design center is brought in to assist the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| in building consensus around a plan to calm traffic in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| We do that through what's called a 3E process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| The first process is education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| We educate people on what they can do to slow traffic down in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| I mean, it's signage, entrance treatments, raising awareness of their own residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| Twenty-five percent of the speeders live in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| So we talk about education and what they can do to raise awareness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| and how to lower the speed limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| We also talk about enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| They can call their ward chiefs and have enforcement brought out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| and then we talk about engineering solutions, which, you know, that's what everybody wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| but we can't afford that all over the city either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| So it actually takes all three of them to come together and make a good comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| And we would like to encourage neighborhoods to do more as far as an entrance treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| and putting up signs and maybe painting some stripes on the road that really don't cost a lot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| but can raise that awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| And that's actually available now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| The city has implemented a process where a neighborhood must put up residential speed limit signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1529)|
| 0:25:36| and an entrance marking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| They have to do that before they can do anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| And then they have to do enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| So there are some requirements before they can get into the engineering solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| and I think that's a great step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| I thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| Anything we can do to help the communities enhance their surroundings, we're glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| Steve, I just wanted to say one thing that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| after David's gone through the process with the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| I would hope that you would really work to streamline the process with the engineering department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| civil engineering and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Councilwoman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| David, I'll just make an observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| It's really taken a lot of people to try to work on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| And I just want to say I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| Your strong, broad shoulders, your willingness to listen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| and your patience have been invaluable to this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| And I think you're aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| I'd like to tell you how much it's meant in a lot of neighborhoods that I've heard a lot from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| And I want to thank Steve, who has been equally as patient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| and as generous with his time to sit with those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| and review their needs and their wishes and what's available and what's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1611)|
| 0:26:58| And then I want to thank Chief Owen, because without your folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| I don't think we could have accomplished all that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| And I think together, the three, in particular these three departments, Mayor Haslam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| have been great because it's really a difficult, this is a difficult issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| And I just want to thank you all so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| I don't think $40,000 is going to be in to cover it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| I think it's twice as much as he needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1654)|

| 0:27:38| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1658)|

| 0:27:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| 11L is a resolution authorizing the mayor to approve change order number six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| to contract number C060131 between the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| and Tennessee Asphalt Company for the 2005 resurfacing project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| for the resurfacing of the Chilhowee Park Midway area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| and to include additional streets as part of KUB's PACE 10 sewer rehabilitation project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| So as to increase the contract price by $335,335.93| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1680)|
| 0:28:06| for a new contract price of $4,126,184.95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1686)|
| 0:28:12| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| I've got a question for Steve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| and I feel bad about this because I had a face-to-face conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| a phone call with Steve and a face-to-face with Brent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| and didn't look on my piece of paper to see I had a question about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| So if you don't know the answer to this, that's my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| As I look at the section of this that deals with the KUB street paving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| I know there have been some issues over in Old North on Scott and Anderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| but when I think of the poster child of sort of KUB's PACE 10 and our streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| I think of Atlantic Avenue where we had repaved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| and within three months later KUB was in there tearing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| And I don't see Atlantic on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| and I wanted to ask what's the status with Atlantic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| Is that on a list someplace else or do you have to look that one up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| And, again, it's my fault if you don't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| I'll have to look that one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| Well, my question was along the same lines in one sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| Just in terms of when it involves PACE 10 streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| streets that have been heavily impacted by PACE 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| how does that break down in terms of who pays for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| Does KUB reimburse us for part of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| We've been working closely with KUB on these streets where they're doing the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| and we sit down with them before they get their permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| and talk about how much work is going to be done and who's going to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| And to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| they have paid for the repair work to the street for the area that they excavate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| Now, sometimes it's worse than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| Sometimes the repair to the main is all done underground through in situ form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| or pipe bursting, and then you just see the lateral repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| They're also even looking at doing the lateral repairs underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| But, yeah, I guess like in the case of South Haven, there were so many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| First the gas lines and then in the middle of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| and then they came back and did the lateral repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| And it impacted the street so heavily that the entire street had to be repaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| In that case, I think KUB paid for a good bit of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| They paid for all that in the South Haven area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| But they did it through our contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| which is similar to what we're doing in this area of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1839)|

| 0:32:37| 11B is an ordinance to amend Chapter 6, Article 2, Section 6-32, Subsection 104.6.4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1957)|

| 0:33:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| Briefly, this is an outgrowth of some state legislation that was passed a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=1993)|
| 0:33:20| We tried to make it work in the city, and we found out that the mechanism to make it work wasn't in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2000)|
| 0:33:26| We had a bill in the last state legislative session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| and the mechanism required was going to be too cumbersome to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| It was called the Older Neighborhood Preservation Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| Worked with the mayor and Dr. Lyons in coming up with something to help spur revitalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2017)|
| 0:33:45| in neighborhoods in the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| Before this time, about all the incentives that were out there applied for big projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| for commercial buildings and for businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| And, you know, this helps it trickle on down to folks like you and me and redoing their households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2037)|
| 0:34:05| We, at this point, are limiting it or trying to limit it to certain neighborhoods, NC1 and H1 overlays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2045)|
| 0:34:15| because we need to see how it's going to take effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| The department that implements this program is going to be losing some revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| which impacts their budget, and they're going to have to be doing a little more work to have this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| So instead of throwing both barn doors open at once, we're going to throw one barn door open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| see how it works, and then, you know, talk about maybe expanding it in the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2073)|
| 0:34:40| because hopefully it will be a good success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| I'm going to go to Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| I'm not sure who was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2085)|

| 0:34:47| What neighborhoods in the empowerment zone are HC1 and NC1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| NC1 would be Fort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| I was going to get Mr. Lyons, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| NC1 would include Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| H1s are Park Ridge, Mechanicsville, Old North, Knoxville, Fourth and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2100)|
| 0:35:10| Those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| Fairmont, Emberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| I'm not sure if that's in the empowerment zone or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| It's in the fifth district, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| It may be, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| It might actually not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| How much are we looking at, would this actually say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| How much does it cost for a building permit and or a plan review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| What's the cost here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| This cost will be about the estimate that was about $5,000, what it was last year for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| Total or per house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| Total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| We're talking about most in the couple hundred dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| Maybe what I guess most might be for a very large project might be five or six, possibly seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| But most would be in the $200 or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| We just kind of see it as a positive step and a good pat on the back for the city to give folks willing to revitalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2151)|
| 0:36:00| and in some cases build upon, you know, empty and vacant lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| Yeah, and I think we should pat folks on the back for doing those things, especially in the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| I guess when I heard the word incentivize, I know it's only $100, $200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| I don't know that we have anybody not willing to do development for that amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| Yeah, we really, Mr. Vice Mayor, never looked at this as a but-for argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| that this would have somebody do something they would otherwise not do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| but more of a statement of support by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| Initially I heard it as a but-for argument, but now I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| Yeah, I guess, Mr. Frost, you might, or Mr. Lyons, my concern is sort of the expansion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2197)|
| 0:36:43| As I looked at this, my first thought was why not include the infill housing overlay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| And to a degree where those end up being or tend to be in just poorer neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| where the $200, $300 actually could be, I got a joke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| that could actually be to the left side of the decimal point in percentages of cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| So just thinking what maybe, you know, why not include those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| and then if we do want to include them down the road, when do we think that might be happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| I mean, just a thought, you know, look at this process in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| It's been built in that it automatically sunsets within four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| So, you know, I won't be on this council, but some of you all will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| to see about whether it gets expanded or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| You know, in part, the empowerment zone also includes parts of Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| So, you know, I don't know how they slipped in other than by the census track that they're contained in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2255)|
| 0:37:42| But, you know, some folks need a little more help than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| I think Councilman Becker makes a very valid point, Mr. Lyons, that maybe we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| and I don't know who would look at that because in some of the lower areas where we're trying to infill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| this could be a but for in some of those situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| So as we look forward to doing things and maybe we can get Mr. O'Hara to weigh in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| because there will be some neighborhoods that maybe could get a vacant lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| and somebody's going to build a house that could make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| I think, you know, refurbishing houses that might need a porch repair or something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| where they have to get a permit, I just, that was my only concern about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| It applies to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| But it only is in certain neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| And my concern was that there are other areas that have as much need and perhaps more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2314)|
| 0:38:42| So I don't know if we just have an understanding that within a year or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| that this be looked at in terms of the economic impact of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| And also, you know, whether it's really being, what would you say, received well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2333)|
| 0:39:00| And it is an incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| But it's certainly something that can be offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| And I think it's something that Councilman Brown and some of the other areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| and other districts really need equally as badly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| My hope would be that maybe we don't wait a year to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| that we kind of start looking at that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| Because not only my district, and you all have heard me use this same scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| you know, the needs of Burlington, Five Points, Vestal, Lonsdale, Mechanicsville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| you know, different areas out in Councilman Becker's district also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| And I could see this, now that we've put something like this on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| and we're setting a precedent for doing so, you know, those areas, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| with some program of this nature, assisting and encouraging folks to develop in those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| would be very, very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| And I think it would be a but for and encouraging folks to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| Councilman Huffman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| One of the things that I'd like to point out is that this is first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| and it could be amended to include the IH1 overlay areas on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2392)|
| 0:40:01| And I, for one, would like to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| So I don't see a problem if other Council members wanted to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| and gave some indication and then we could maybe move towards an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| on amending it for the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| I guess, actually, I wouldn't see any point amending on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| If we're inclined to do it, let's amend it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| and that actually allows the administration to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| So it sounds like there's interest in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| Could I clarify one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| To interrupt just for a moment, the ordinance really allows the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| which specifies the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| So we have two readings of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| but the ordinance really enables the Council by resolution to enact these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| So that's what would actually specify what would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| The ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| Are you saying the ordinance actually here does specify we could expand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| but I guess we would have to redo the ordinance now that you mentioned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| I mean, it sounds like there's some interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| and it seems like one option would be, say, in a year we want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| I'm hearing people saying we should do this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| I mean, it feels like we should talk about an amendment to add the infill housing overlays to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| and I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| Do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| I'll second that motion so we can discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| Okay, there's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| Is everybody clear on what Mr. Becker just moved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| Go ahead, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| Well, I think what I would do, and Mr. Swanson, check me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| The caption might be an issue on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| I would just say, you know, down in the exception section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| waive building review permit for non-qualifying projects in H1, NC1, and what is it, Mark IH1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2506)|
| 0:41:55| Is that the infill housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| Just to do that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| Is that, Ms. Roddy, is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| And Mr. Swanson, does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| There's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| Is there any discussion to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| Mr. Lyons, then once the corresponding resolution is passed, as somebody said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2536)|
| 0:42:23| just sticking our toe in the water and just looking at those overlay districts that are within the empowerment zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| do you anticipate that adding IH1 is going to increase the cost to the city significantly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| Let me add, this hits it two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| First, there's the administrative cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| We identified how that would be done, and that would expand that a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| I don't know if that would be much difficulty or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| We didn't really do any estimate beyond as was specified in the ordinance as to what the cost would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| So I guess during that time we could ask to get some more information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| But the $5,000 estimate was based on what this would have cost during the last fiscal year had this been in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2575)|
| 0:43:03| And had it been applied just within the EZ?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| Mr. Lyons or Dr. Lyons, I would assume that there's no way to sort of quantify this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| But my personal assumption, let me put it this way, is that even though it's a relatively minor incentive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2595)|
| 0:43:22| as Councilman Becker pointed out, in the infill housing areas, it may actually be a more impactful incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2602)|
| 0:43:30| But it certainly sends a message, as you said, this is where we want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| We want to encourage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| Even if it's just sort of token from a monetary standpoint, it sends a positive and encouraging message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| If that indeed has the impact that we hope it would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| then I would expect that we would see more return in terms of increased property values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2624)|
| 0:43:51| and, therefore, property taxes than we would see costs from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| And I realize there's no way to do an effective analysis of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| But would you say that's probably a reasonable assumption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| I think Vice Mayor Brown's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| There's a lot more probability that they're going to actually have something happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| that would not otherwise happen here than in some of the other neighborhoods we're speaking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| So that would allow you to enter that into the calculus, which we did not enter into the calculus the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| I don't know that we could quantify it, but it would be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| Announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| Let me just say I'm glad I'm going to support the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| And, you know, if you want to look at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| trying to come up with a figure on what's going to increase the cost to the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| I would have some difficulty on second reading, voting for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| if we come back with a report that says we think it's cost prohibitive to add in these infill areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| but we do want to do it for NC1 and H1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| I'd have a problem then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| So I just want to say that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| Now, if we come back and say, hey, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| we don't want to provide that incentive out there because it's going to cost us a little too much administrative-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| So as we look at that, I do want to hear those figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| But I'd have a big problem passing it just for a very limited area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| And we've got an area we've now identified, I think, and most people agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| could really benefit from, and those are the infill areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| I haven't seconded motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| Councilman Baylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| Mayor, I was just going to say I appreciate Councilman Holquist's questions and his points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| and it sounds like it's, you know, a good incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| Now, if you're a property owner in these areas, how do you become aware of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| When you go door-to-door, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| I've got time to, you know, gear it up for you so I can go explain it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| No, how, if you're a property owner, do you really become aware that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| fees have been waived and that maybe now is the time to go to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| Well, some of it would be at the point of going to, you know, to get the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| I mean, you know, that is, if it were marked in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| Then they would already have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| So it's really not sort of an incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| I mean, you'd hope that people out in certain areas, property owners, own an old house or something, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| one day could see something in the mail and say, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| at least I don't have to go down there and pay these permit fees, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| So just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| Hopefully the Sentinel will return to city council at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| In a positive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| Maybe we can look into that, how you can, you know, further enhance people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| It goes with their property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2775)|
| 0:46:21| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| Just to, as the maker of the motion, I guess I'm going to disagree with my good friend, the vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| I think this is a great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| If it comes back and it's too expensive on infill, I'll still support it in the historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| I think it's a good proposal for as much as we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| I guess in answer to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| I think that's actually an excellent question, Joe, about how people find out about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| My sense is, thinking about all the neighborhoods that have NC1s or H1s or even infill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2803)|
| 0:46:49| all of them have pretty active neighborhood associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| This feels like the kind of thing where these ought to be the institutions on the ground telling people, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| this is what's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| And I think in some places it could make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| I mean, it could work exactly the way it should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| So I think our, I guess we actually do have, now that we're in the new budget, an office in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| And maybe we can make this a task for them to take on quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| Councilman Pelow, and then I'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Well, that was going to be my comment, just having sat in on many of those meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| that that seems to be a very good resource place for people to find out things that are incentives that can assist them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2840)|
| 0:47:29| And those seem to be the neighborhoods that I hope are going to benefit most from that task force's work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| and the future office of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| So I think that's kind of where it gets parked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| And maybe Ms. O'Hara will speak to it, if that becomes part of that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2860)|
| 0:47:47| Certainly we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| And, in addition, the other work that we do in the community through our housing rehab,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| our homeowner down payment assistance and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| our various programs, we can help make people aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| Well, that's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| I was going to suggest that her department and the office of neighborhoods could really play a role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| Councilman Becker, just for clarification, we've not changed the latter part of this as it reflects IH1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2888)|
| 0:48:15| So the IH1s would still have to be within the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| Because where it fits in there is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| Would it be all IH1s or would it be ones within the empowerment zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| So our motion on the floor is Mr. Becker's motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| Any further discussion on that then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2916)|

| 0:48:40| Those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| We'll move the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| Is there any further discussion there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2924)|

| 0:49:52| I was just curious, number 800, excuse me, yeah, 800 office equipment is a far bigger number than anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=2992)|
| 0:50:01| in that breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| That's sort of a general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| You have equipment in other places and you have office furniture and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3004)|
| 0:50:11| That's kind of a catch-all, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| But I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| It's not a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| I don't want to get way down in the weeds on this, but it just caught my eye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| and I was curious as to what that's all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| That includes some software programs and whatnot that allow us to exchange information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3023)|

| 0:51:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3077)|
| 0:51:18| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| 12G is an ordinance to amend Chapter 16, Article 11, Section 16-420,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| Subsection B-2 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Knoxville, regulating solicitation on public streets, requested by Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3086)|
| 0:51:33| I'll move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| Yeah, let me just give a quick background on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| I've been called by the Firefighters Association, I guess Tuesday of last week, about getting something on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3098)|
| 0:51:45| They do their annual boot drive, and we're thinking that was coming up fairly soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| Wanted to actually update the ordinance on where we're allowed to do road solicitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| Had thought at that moment that we needed to get this on so they could get the two readings done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| Turns out that boot day is actually going to be in August, so we have two more meetings between now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| So if we want to put this off for consideration, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| In looking at this, it turns out that the ordinance that's currently on the books is considerably old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3130)|
| 0:52:18| There's some streets that don't exist anymore that are on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| So this hasn't been updated more recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| Have a discussion I had with Lieutenant Boone that we worked this out, Lieutenant Boone from the Traffic Safety Department at KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3144)|
| 0:52:32| to work out the current list that's on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| My sense would be to pass this on first reading and amend it at the next meeting if we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| but I don't think there's any problem if we postpone this if there are questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| And I appreciate the efforts and what the Fire Department does with regards to Section 16-420.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3167)|
| 0:52:54| And for other reasons other than what they do, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| I'm going to make a motion that we at this juncture delete E, F, and H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3177)|
| 0:53:07| G and D are in my district also, but Magnolia University are big intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| I've got a big problem in my district with folk who do soliciting in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| You know, kids are getting out in ball clubs and things of this nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| And first I saw this was on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| I'd like to talk to somebody about that and whether or not we're authorizing them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| You know, I get a lot of complaints about, you know, the ball teams and the folk who are outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| And those particular intersections I just mentioned are a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| And, quite frankly, I'm not very comfortable with the message it sends to our youth sometimes when they're out doing some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| At this juncture I'd like to have those stricken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| I don't see our youth organizations in Magnolia Avenue and Prosser doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| or at University and College Street, those bigger intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| But I do see them at these others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| And also McCall Avenue to Chestnut is no longer an intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| Vine and McCall is no longer an intersection either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| So I'd like to have those deleted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| And maybe later on in the date maybe I'll be convinced to add those in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| But I just have some major problems with some of the solicitations that are done by some of our youth organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| at those very dangerous intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| And I don't want anything we pass to seem to be authorizing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| and making it very illegal for them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| Councilman Hulkless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| What I would like to see is more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| And I guess I could vote for this on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| I appreciate what the fire department is trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| They're not the only organization that this would impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| In fact, anyone who meets the nonprofit qualifications, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| can apply for this kind of solicitation permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| One of the things that I would like to see is I don't know how far back we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| I'd say at least five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| Which organizations have applied for these permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| and used these permits over the past five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| So, you know, how much activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| Who are they and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| I think that's important information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| You know, individually, I don't have a problem with the fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| and I probably don't have a problem with some of the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| but I want to have a better feel for collectively what the impact is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| My tendency is to think that sometimes these are problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| I know with the firemen that's probably not the case because they're professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| they're trained in safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| So I think they're going to be, if there are any problems from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| they're going to be the least of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| But I think it's something that I'd like to take a closer look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| I don't mind voting for it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| I'm not sure if I support the whole concept at all anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| I just don't know what the impacts are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| and I don't know how much of a safety issue it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| As far as I know, there have not been any accidents related to these solicitations in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| I'd like to know that, too, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| Ms. Pila, I'm not sure of his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| Ms. Pila.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| Well, I think there's several things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| I was really pleased to see this had been relooked because some of the intersections in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| I feel, have been very dangerous ones, very, very busy intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| where now with all the turn errors and so on, traffic is moving constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3370)|
| 0:56:16| And so I have been concerned because I have felt that people were there not recognizing the danger they were in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| or the danger they're putting motorists in if motorists decide to stop and spend a moment with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| So I was, frankly, very pleased to see that they were looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| You know, I don't think we can stand judge and jury over who can solicit and who can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3393)|
| 0:56:39| I think those decisions need to be made by, I don't know how they're made now, really, to tell you the truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3399)|
| 0:56:45| but I don't particularly want to stand judge and jury over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| But I do think that we have to be particularly concerned about the safety of everyone involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| And I think one of the issues that, and so, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| I was delighted to see a couple of intersections deleted from Second District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| because I felt there was not wisdom there and had thought we ought to talk to somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| So I appreciate Bob taking the initiative of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| I think one of the issues here is now we have red light cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| and I think that is one of the driving issues that the police department, if I understand correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3435)|
| 0:57:21| from Officer Boone has taken into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| And that is certainly something we need to allow them to make a judgment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| So, frankly, I was glad to see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| And I can support the two intersections which are busy intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| and still will give an opportunity for the solicitation that seems to be important to some of these groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3457)|
| 0:57:43| But I think it will keep them safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| And after speaking with some of the representatives of the fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| they are very concerned about the safety of their personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| and don't want to put them in positions where it's not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| They also don't want them to put them in positions, if I understand correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| where they may be jeopardized by theft or almost like a mugging or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| where the funds are diverted to some person instead of going to the charity that they are designed for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3486)|
| 0:58:16| So I think some of these recommendations probably have a lot of history to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| that we need to take seriously and that Officer Boone probably is a good one to evaluate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| Counselor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| Yes, just a couple of real quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| I know, Joe, in response to your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| we have some information, Lieutenant Boone sent an e-mail out that I got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| on how often different intersections have actually had permits issued for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| And in the last four years, the most has been 21 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| So, you know, in four years, that's, what, five times a year at the busiest intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3523)|
| 0:58:49| So it's not used very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| Just a thought, initially when I knew that this was not a cut and dry, Ms. Pelos, sort of, let's change this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| I actually thought about the idea of let's just have a policy that says not at red light intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| but it's okay everywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| And interestingly, what Lieutenant Boone's answer was that there's a different set of traffic problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| with pedestrians than the red light cameras deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| So there's some intersections, North Shore and Kingston Pike being one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| where there's not a red light camera, but clearly it's too big and too dangerous for cars to go at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3556)|
| 0:59:22| I guess I also know that the Firefighters Association actually has a few other streets they'd like to add in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3562)|
| 0:59:28| I don't know if Council would like to hear that now for consideration or just bring that up in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| But they're here if we want to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3574)|
| 0:59:39| Councilman Hawthorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| Chief Owen, I would like to get some sort of official response from the Police Department, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3580)|
| 0:59:48| in terms of overall, you know, if there's a position or a response to this from KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3588)|
| 0:59:56| in terms of the safety and efficacy of having these kinds of permits in these intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3596)|
| 1:00:02| and also perhaps more specifically if there are intersections that they're more concerned about than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| If there's a concern in general or if you say, okay, we're fine with it, it's never been a problem, we don't care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| we don't see it as an issue, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| Or if you say, well, you know, we've always been concerned or we're becoming concerned, I'd like to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3616)|
| 1:00:22| And also if it's, well, we're not concerned in general, but we have concerns about these specific intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3622)|
| 1:00:29| and then you list some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| Just some response I think would be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| I don't mean necessarily today, but some sort of semi-official response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| You can do it now if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| Whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3640)|
| 1:00:47| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| I just want to say the information that I think Mr. Councilman Becker has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| and I do appreciate him bringing this forward, that he's gotten from Lieutenant Boone, I think it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| I'd like to have that also to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| And I want to make sure that I didn't leave one out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| I said I wanted the amendment to exclude E, F, G, and H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| Those would be the four that I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| I didn't say G and G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| When I first looked at that, University Avenue and College Street is a much smaller area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| I was first thinking that was University and Western, but University and College is another very red light area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| but it's a little small street there too, so I'd like those excluded at this juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| And that was a motion to amend, and it was seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| By deleting E, F, G, and H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| Any other comments before we vote on the motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| I do think that if there's some additional streets that the fire department would like to have added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| it would be better to hear them today than in two weeks from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| Lloyd, do you guys want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| You're welcome to if you'd like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| I don't know if I've got the original one that Lieutenant Boone gave them, but I talked to Lieutenant Boone yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3712)|
| 1:02:01| I'm sorry, just for the record, give us your name and address, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| Teddy Dyer, 8012 Coppock Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| I talked to Lieutenant Boone yesterday, and he was concerned more about the red light cameras intersections than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3730)|
| 1:02:18| And I told him before the council met again that I would sit down with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| and we'd go over the new list, old list, and try to work out something that would work for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3744)|
| 1:02:32| And if Mr. Becker or whoever would like to sit in on it, we'd do that sometime next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| That way everybody would, you know, voice their concerns where we could have them and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3758)|
| 1:02:46| So, I mean, that's the recommendation I'm making now, if that's okay with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3772)|
| 1:02:53| Council, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| Council Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| Well, I was going to say, you'd say rather than even say now what your suggestions are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| you want to sit down with Lieutenant Boone and go over it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| And he was going to try to get together today, and it just didn't work out for me to hear him either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| But he was going to try to get together and look over all the intersections that he talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| and the ones that we had talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| Because I don't think either one of us had the list I give him or the old list that's been, I think, 30 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3793)|
| 1:03:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| Thanks, Teddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| I think everybody understands what their desire is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| Right now the motion is on the floor to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| And seeing nothing else, we're going to go ahead with that vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| All those in favor of the motion to amend, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| Now back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| Thanks, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| On public forum, we have two folks signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| Alonzo Montgomery first and then David Williams second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3838)|
| 1:04:15| Alonzo Montgomery, Knottville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| Mr. Mayor, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| I was riding around the city and I said, man, you know, this guy has been around for reelection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| And I haven't had a sit-down in his office for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| You know, it's about time we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| You know, I thought about your legacy, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| You know, South Mountain is going to be the only legacy you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| And then you're going to have Uptown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| That's going to be your legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| Victor Ann built this city in 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| You ought to have more than that in the next four years, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| You need to have some kind of legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| Because, you know, your legacy to me in the next four years you do, because you're really not running against anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3888)|
| 1:04:56| So I figured, man, you need to build up East Knottville in the next four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| We got sidewalks that need councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| You know, you said in his budget you're going to have so much money for sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| You know, East Knottville sidewalks are a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| You know, I never hear the councilman talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| They've been up there almost six, seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| They ain't did nothing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| It's about time somebody take an interest in East Knottville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| When councilman Brown sits down, whoever's going to get in there, if you're not going to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| somebody needs to get in there and is going to do something about the doggone community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| The roads are a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| You go down Harrison to Louise, they just never fixed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3935)|
| 1:05:41| But they let it sit there for over a year, and then they have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| Every road they fix in East Knottville, they have to repair them, councilman Woodall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| You know, when I ride around rest of Knottville, everybody, my old wagon, don't hit no bumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3948)|
| 1:05:54| You know, don't have to worry about it getting tore up more than it already is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| Always putting doggone new axles on it in East Knottville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| You know, I'm saying, what's this man's legacy going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| Trying to get a convention center hotel so they can get rid of that $12 million deficit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| You know, if you're going to make the South Knoxville waterfront your legacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| maybe let's do something about East Knottville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| You know, and I thought about that with you, but that's not my reason for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| But, you know, next four years, I expect you to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| I'm going to be worse than Mr. Poor Boy on you, because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| I've let you off in that first four years because I think you're pretty cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| Well, it's because I beat you running that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| Oh, you like to kill me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| I'll admit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| You caught me on a bad day, you know, taking you early in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| Early in the morning, I think I killed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| What was your next thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| My next thing, Mr. Murray, you know, I've got to get on the county again before you all go home, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4000)|
| 1:06:46| I've got to get on the county again, you know, and then I'm out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| But the county, you know, I came up by your office this morning, and I looked around, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4010)|
| 1:06:57| Mayor Ransdell, he ain't too bad of a guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| He's got a funny old smile on his face, but he ain't too bad of a guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| But this guy, he's trying to run the county just like you run the city, and it's two separate entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4025)|
| 1:07:12| It's two separate entities, you know, and he's trying to run the county hand-in-hand with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4032)|
| 1:07:17| It'll never be done until you become a metro government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| You know, the way you let Kessler leave when she supposedly had messed up, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4040)|
| 1:07:28| Renee Kessler, when she left, you know, hey, she left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| She fell on some things for paperwork, procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| They wasn't done, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| And now here on the 5 o'clock news today, this young lady, she's got a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| Why couldn't they have just reprimanded her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| I hope you're listening, Mayor Ransdell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| You all should have reprimanded that young lady and let her pay, take a little bit out of her paycheck every pay period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4070)|
| 1:07:58| and repay the doggone tax payers in Knox County because it wasn't her fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| Now, she's a scapegoat for Cynthia Finch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| I hope people down on Channel 12 are listening tonight because she's a scapegoat for Cynthia Finch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| I know my time's about up, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| But like I told Mike Owens this morning on the sixth floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| Cynthia Finch needs to get her briefcase and walk down those corridors and go out that front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4098)|
| 1:08:24| If Renee Kessler was good enough to do it, Cynthia Finch needs to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| because in the military, we ain't going to just cut the arm off of that private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| We're going after that supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| See, there's a whole lot more problems in community service than that young lady that resigned today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4114)|
| 1:08:41| You know, when that woman did that thing with that, I'm not talking to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| I'm talking to those out there in TV land because people, you know, they listen to Halloran Hill and all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4125)|
| 1:08:51| I don't call those shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| But, Mr. Mayor, in closing, Cynthia Finch needs to go, Mayor Ransdell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4132)|
| 1:08:59| She has done a lot of wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| She's done a lot of wrong with the Burlington Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| She violated the 1964 Civil Rights Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| You got away with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| Cynthia Finch needs to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| He had nothing to tell me this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| She's a hard worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| I hope everybody in county government are hard workers since they're getting paid with taxpayer funds, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| But I'm going to be on this one for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| I don't have nothing really bad to say about the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| One last thing you need to do, Mr. Mayor, in your next four years, you need to do some annexations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4163)|
| 1:09:29| We need to do some annexing, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| We need to take some more of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| You're laughing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| I'm dead serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| That's one thing they might have been mad that Victor asked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| But you haven't done much annexing in your first four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| You need to bring no raffles into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| David Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4186)|
| 1:09:58| Well, I'm David Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| I reside at 505 Hollywood Drive in beautiful and picturesque Pond Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| Well, I'm actually going to come here not to compliment some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| I didn't bring any photos, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| On behalf of the Pond Gap Association, I'd like to thank the Department of Engineering and specifically Mr. Brent Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4209)|
| 1:10:15| I think about a couple of months ago when I was here, we outlined some problems we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| And one was the shoulder at the corner of Hollywood and Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4220)|
| 1:10:25| And the red drivers were using that as a makeshift turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| And we requested in our conversation with Mr. Johnson to put up some poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| Well, they have been placed there, and they're working very well, not only protecting the pedestrians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4232)|
| 1:10:38| but actually the westbound traffic on Sutherland, mind you, turning on to Hollywood, are actually slowing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4238)|
| 1:10:45| You can actually see the car and not just a blur going by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| So I want to thank Mr. Johnson on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| In fact, now when school gets started, the crossing guard will not have to put a barrel in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4251)|
| 1:10:56| So we're going to have a barrel retirement ceremony and all of you are invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| Now, also to reward Mr. Johnson, I think we're going to do something fitting to all engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4261)|
| 1:11:07| We're going to give him some more problems to solve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| So since his boss is right here, I think we'll include him as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| But I just want to show you I don't always come here to complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| And I'd like to thank the mayor for the new position of office of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| And I got to speak with Mrs. O'Hara the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| And something has come up over the last few months that has really bothered my neighborhood association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| I've had several elderly members almost in tears about some things that they have heard second and third hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4287)|
| 1:11:34| Apparently, there's some people that are coming up with proposals for our neighborhood without our approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4294)|
| 1:11:42| knowledge, or input at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| I'm not here to name any names or to scorn anyone, but to try to educate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| And the neighborhood meeting we had not too long ago, the neighbors told me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| why don't you go to council and just explain what our quandary is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| I feel like with this office of neighborhoods, if somebody has a suggestion for Pongett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| why don't they talk to me or come to one of our meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| We always put these big yellow signs out in several intersections to, hey, there's a meeting tonight at Cagle Terrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4325)|
| 1:12:11| But it's tough to read about something second and third hand about, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| this group wants to put a traffic circle here or a greenway or a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4335)|
| 1:12:20| There are things in the Bearden Village Plan that haven't even been implemented for Pongett yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| I don't know if these people don't understand what our boundaries are, but I can give them a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| Someone said the other day that some group said Pongett wasn't even in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| And I don't know where these people get crazy things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| But, anyway, I'm hoping the people on TV will hear this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| And I'm sure they have all kinds of good intent, but it's very disparaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4358)|
| 1:12:44| I wouldn't go into somebody else's neighborhood and do some things and go directly to the city and say, hey, Mr. King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4364)|
| 1:12:50| we want to do this for so-and-so neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| I just don't understand these people at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| And, finally, Mr. Becker, you were reading my mind about the sidewalk ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| Now, the Fountain City Connections folks were gracious enough to mail our association a rough draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4381)|
| 1:13:06| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| However, I do not want to throw cold water on their fervor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| but there are several provisions in here that I think would hurt my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| In fact, I took a little trip the other day and went to some other neighborhoods, some of the older neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4394)|
| 1:13:20| and we've got problems with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| There are four or five places we need to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| So when you start discussing this, let's open this up to the public for some real nice input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4404)|
| 1:13:30| And, anyway, happy fourth, and I hope this is food for thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| and congratulations on the Pelos for their anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4416)|
| 1:13:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| Don't run off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| Let me look at that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| I also forgot to recognize Margie Nichols had a birthday somewhere in the same number as Sam Anderson's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4426)|
| 1:13:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| Thanks, everybody, tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4434)|
| 1:13:55| I appreciate you coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4435)|
| 1:13:56| Have a great July 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070703?start=4436)|
