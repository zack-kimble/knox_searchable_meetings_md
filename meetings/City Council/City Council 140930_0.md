| 0:02:38| I need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| I don't need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=160)|

| 0:02:50| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| Yeah, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| First I want to recognize some of our fire and police personnel who were recently honored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| by the respective departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| On September the 19th, the police department honored the 17 members of the East District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| Delta Squad as patrol unit of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| During the month of June, Delta Squad recorded 19 deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| and 57% of weapon charges for the entire patrol division in that month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| On September the 19th, the police department honored the 17 members of the East District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| Delta Squad as patrol unit of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| During the month of June, Delta Squad recorded 9 DUI arrests, 19 drug arrests, and recorded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=181)|
| 0:03:10| 20 felony arrests that accounted for 31% of drug charges and 57% of weapon charges for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=190)|
| 0:03:18| the entire patrol division in that month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| And yesterday, the fire department recognized five members of Station 18 on Wise Garver Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=201)|
| 0:03:27| firefighters of the second quarter. On May 15, five firefighters saved the life of a TDOT driver who came to the station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=207)|
| 0:03:37| house complaining of chest pains. When the gentleman went into cardiac arrest, the crew at the station 18 gave him CPR and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=217)|
| 0:03:44| oxygen and used AED pads to give him electrical shocks. These combined efforts stabilized him until an ambulance arrived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=224)|
| 0:03:52| and saved his life. So again, these are the kind of heroic actions that our uniformed employees perform every day and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=232)|
| 0:04:00| to be ready to perform at any minute. Chief Allen, Chief Sharp, I hope your folks know how much we all appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=240)|
| 0:04:10| I'd like to also announce that this Friday, October 3rd, the city is presenting the third annual accessibility symposium from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=250)|
| 0:04:18| 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Civic Coliseum. This is a great program that helps professionals in the construction and design industries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=258)|
| 0:04:26| understand what accessibility really means to people with disabilities and how easy it is to do accessible design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=266)|
| 0:04:35| If you think about it, on the front end of a project. So that's a very important meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| As all the members of council know, we'll be hosting a panel from the Urban Land Institute. This is something the mayor included in her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=281)|
| 0:04:49| budget this year to get some outside expertise and advice on redeveloping several properties around downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=289)|
| 0:04:57| The panel will be here from this Sunday through next Friday, October the 10th, making site visits and doing interviews with local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=297)|
| 0:05:04| officials, residents, business owners, developers, non-profit organizations, and other stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=304)|
| 0:05:12| They will conclude they will make a public presentation of their findings and recommendations next Friday the 10th at 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| in the Busy Theater. So I know we're all looking forward to working with them and hearing what they have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=318)|
| 0:05:26| And let's don't forget that next Tuesday, October the 7th, is National Night Out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| I'm sure my council colleagues are planning to visit a lot of our local neighborhood groups who will be hosting a lot of different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| activities around town from 5 to 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=337)|
| 0:05:44| This is always a great night, a great chance for neighbors to get together. And for once, it's not on a council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=344)|
| 0:05:52| For years, it's always been on our council meeting. It's been very difficult for us to have to get out there and rush back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| And so next Thursday, October the 9th, the Knoxville Fire Department will present the annual Firefighters Memorial Service and Luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=358)|
| 0:06:07| That begins at 1130 at the downtown fire station on Summit Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| I was just talking a minute ago about the dedication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| That Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| Yes. Thursday, October the 9th at 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| And I was just talking a minute ago about the dedication of our uniformed employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| This event is an opportunity to really reflect on their service and sacrifice, and I encourage everyone to come out for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=382)|
| 0:06:30| I'd like to also recognize our newly elected criminal court clerk, Mike Hammond, is out here in the audience with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=390)|
| 0:06:38| So thank you for being here. It's good to see you at one of our council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| There are reports from members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=404)|
| 0:06:50| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| I wanted to remind everybody that we have an election coming up soon with early voting starting on October the 15th through the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=412)|
| 0:07:03| And the last day to register is October the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| So I want to encourage all of our citizens to register and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| I'm not telling you who to vote for, but I hope that everyone will participate in the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| But if we call you, you'll tell us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| All right. We'll go to Councilman Steger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| I just want to announce the Public Property Naming Committee is meeting on October 21st at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=447)|
| 0:07:34| If you want to name or rename any public property, please submit your applications and we'll review them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=454)|
| 0:07:42| Okay. Elections and confirmation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=462)|
| 0:07:50| Oh, is Jim York?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| Yeah, let's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| He's going to present the final funding report on general obligations bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| Mayor and Council, Jim York, Finance Director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| In accordance with TCA 9-21-151, we are required to do a final funding report on the issuance of any debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=485)|
| 0:08:18| I will tell you that on September 17th, the city sold $31,080,000 in new bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=498)|
| 0:08:31| We had 10 bidders bidding on the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| Interest rates that were bid ranged from 2.87% to roughly 3.2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=515)|
| 0:08:44| Clearly, we selected the one with the lowest interest rate at 2.87%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| That is less than what we expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| To give you some idea of how things priced, the state sold a $190 million bond issue in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=532)|
| 0:09:00| Their rates were 2.99%, so we actually ended up beating what the state got in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=540)|
| 0:09:07| So it was a pretty good rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| The actual interest rates on the bonds ranged from 1.5% to 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=550)|
| 0:09:17| Again, final size was $31,080,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| There was a $527,000 premium paid on the bonds, which means that they paid us more than $31 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=561)|
| 0:09:30| in order for us to pay them back $31,080,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=570)|
| 0:09:38| This is a 20-year bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| It has a seven-year call, which means that at the end of seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| we could call all the outstanding debt either through refunding or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| if we were so lucky that we had enough money to pay them off, we could pay them off at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=589)|
| 0:09:55| Total cost of issuance, excluding underwriters discount, was $169,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| Underwriters discount was $204,000 and some change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| Again, what we will have going into the construction fund is a little bit over $31.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=607)|
| 0:10:16| I'll be happy to answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| Yeah, Jim, if I understand this, if we run the full 20-year term on these bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| we will pay about $11 million in interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| Is that the figure $42,039,851 is on page four of the report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=631)|
| 0:10:38| If we run the full 20 years, the principal, again, will be $31,080,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=638)|
| 0:10:46| The interest will be, again, just a hair under $11 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| One other question, if you could explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| Looking at the table that's in the Cumberland securities report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=655)|
| 0:11:01| explain that variable interest from year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| Sometimes it's 1% or 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| Sometimes it's as high as 4% or 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| And I don't know whether there are different tranches of the bonds or just the rate is variable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| These are what are known as serial bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| Basically, if you look at it, it's actually a set of 20 separate bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| So you can think of we've got some one-year bonds, some two-year bonds, some three-year bonds, four-year bonds, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| And so each of those price slightly differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| The longer term being more expensive, I suppose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| The true interest cost on those long-term bonds would be higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| The shorter ones actually carry a higher coupon, but there was a significant premium paid for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| So the effective rate is a lot lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| Final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| If some widow woman wants to buy one of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| where do they get one of these Knoxville, Tennessee bonds that they can invest instead of getting their bank to pay them 0.25% interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=713)|
| 0:12:01| Where would they buy one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| Well, they would probably go through a brokerage account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| The people who purchased the bonds were Raymond James, formerly Morgan Key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| You might call those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| My guess is that everything has already been sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| but it's possible that they might be able to pick up some there in denominations of $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=739)|
| 0:12:26| So you'd have to have at least $5,000 to invest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| So financial institutions pick them up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| Is that what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| You may have one insurance company or whatever that might take out the whole deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| Typically what will happen is that institutional buyers will buy probably all of one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=758)|
| 0:12:45| So, for example, they might buy all of the 2015 bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| Somebody else might buy all of the 2016 and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=774)|

| 0:14:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| We've already discussed this the last time, but if Jim York is still here, he might come visit with us one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=888)|
| 0:14:58| Mr. York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| Jim, we talked about these items and we talked about the possibility of saving 25% of it for some rainy day money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=900)|
| 0:15:07| and I think we've gotten past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| But my question is, have you been following this current debate that seems to say they want to do away with the Hall income tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=909)|
| 0:15:17| if that were to come to fruition, wouldn't you have a $5 million hole in your budget next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| I mean, that seems like yet another reason to be cautious about spending the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| But tell us about the Hall income tax and how you're going to budget if it ain't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| Well, the Hall income tax, the budget for this year is $4.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=934)|
| 0:15:41| If the state were to repeal it in all one year and not to hold the cities harmless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=941)|
| 0:15:47| then obviously we would have a $4.9 million gap going into next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=947)|
| 0:15:57| My guess is if that were to happen, we would obviously present a balanced budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| The mayor will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| We will be making recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| My guess is that capital funding might suffer as part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| But, again, that's, well, unfortunately it's only about four months away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| So the inclination if the state, and, again, I'm just reading into it to what I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=977)|
| 0:16:24| is that the state would phase out that tax over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=984)|
| 0:16:31| Over several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Over multiple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| It might be a four to five year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| And there's also a proposal to hold the cities harmless, which would have, again, no impact on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=996)|
| 0:16:44| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| Does your saving finger twitch at all here when you hear that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| Well, we will continue to monitor all the financial situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| and try and keep a tight rein on expenditures to make sure that we're ready to budget for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1015)|
| 0:17:04| Seeing no further last, we have a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1024)|

| 0:21:15| received this proposal from Positively Living to add five units. Specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1275)|

| 0:21:32| Positively Living. That's fine. I was focused more on this. When you said it was in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| 2010-2011 plan, do they survive from year to year or do you renew them as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| submit your action plan to HUD? Annually we do a new action plan, but if the funds are not spent during that year, the funds stay in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1302)|
| 0:21:55| program. They don't expire at the end of the fiscal year for the federal government? No. Okay. All right. Thank you. I don't have any questions for Steve, but someone else may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1315)|
| 0:22:04| Yes, I do. I talked with Mr. Jenkins today and since he's here I'd like for him to come down and tell us a little more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1324)|
| 0:22:11| They do a very fine job over there. Steve Jenkins, I'm the Executive Director of Positively Living. Thank you for having me here tonight. We're really excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1331)|
| 0:22:20| about the expansion of the existing program. Positively Living has been around since the mid-90s and we provide several different services. The program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1340)|
| 0:22:28| that we've talked about tonight is our permanent supportive housing program for men and it serves men that not only have AIDS, but also have a combination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1348)|
| 0:22:35| of mental disorders including mental illness, addiction, physical disabilities, as well as other health conditions like cancer, hepatitis. So it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1355)|
| 0:22:43| combination of diseases that we deal with. So the housing that we provide, we provide that to a very delicate group of people. So the five units that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1363)|
| 0:22:52| expanding will allow us to serve five of the most vulnerable people in our community. So we look forward to that. Any questions about the specifics of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1372)|
| 0:23:00| housing program? Thank you very much. Thank you all. Thank you for what you do. There's been a motion and a second. Further discussion? If not, all those in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1380)|
| 0:23:10| favor, aye. Aye. 11B is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute a quick claim deed to Bruce Goff for one parcel of property located at 945| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1390)|

| 0:23:28| Second. All those in favor, aye. Aye. 11C is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute a quick claim deed to Terry Jenkins for one parcel of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1408)|
| 0:23:37| located at 2625 Sevier Avenue within the limits of the City of Knoxville pursuant to the Homeacres Program for a contract sales price of $500. So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1417)|
| 0:23:46| Second. Councilman Delbo. Becky, let me ask you just quickly. This is unusual in that it's just a vacant lot as opposed to a house that someone is trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1426)|
| 0:23:56| to bring back. Is there any, in that program, is there any restrictions or review of what gets built or is there any criteria that they must follow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1436)|
| 0:24:05| Absolutely. If we sell a lot for construction of a house, we monitor that until it's completed. This lot happens to be unbuildable. It's extremely steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1445)|
| 0:24:17| The City acquired this property in a tax sale and this will be used as a side yard, but we will still monitor to make sure that the owner is keeping the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1457)|
| 0:24:28| mowed and taken care of. So he basically just joins it to his regular parcel and treats it as a side yard. That's correct. All right. Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1468)|
| 0:24:39| We have a motion to second. All those in favor, aye. Aye. 11-D is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute change order number one to contract number C-13-266| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1479)|

| 0:25:03| and extending the date of completion. Move to approve. Second. All those in favor, aye. Aye. 11-E is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute change order number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1503)|
| 0:25:14| three to contract number C-13-189 with CDM Smith, Inc. for Construction Engineering Inspection Services for a new bridge from Joe Johnson Drive to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1514)|

| 0:25:34| Councilman Delvaux. Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| Jim Hagerman, is this the final change order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| I mean, this project is done. You can ride on the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| I'm assuming we're done inspecting and we're just kind of catching up with sort of time spent and billables and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1545)|
| 0:25:52| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| It's absolutely complete. The only thing I saw that didn't seem to be done was the railroad facility, but that's not part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1557)|
| 0:26:05| This is solely the Joe Johnson Bridge, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| This is solely the Joe Johnson Bridge. We have not received an as-built yet, but the bridge itself is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1567)|
| 0:26:17| And this is, as you say, catching up with paperwork, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| Thank you. Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| Second. All those in favor, aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Southern Constructors, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| for the Westland Drainage and Bridge Improvement Project for an amount not to exceed $1,796,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1593)|
| 0:26:40| Councilman Greene. Thank you, Mayor, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| I'd like for Mr. Hagerman to explain a little bit about what this project is and how it's changed from the original,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| but also talk a little bit about scheduling in terms of when this project will begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| We've been getting a number of phone calls about the closure of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| So, Jim. Well, this project has taken a long time to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1616)|
| 0:27:05| We finally have a good bid and we're ready to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1625)|
| 0:27:11| There's some significant flooding issues, mostly roadway flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| but it does get into some buildings sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| It is a significant safety issue when it does flood and have to close the road briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1641)|
| 0:27:30| So this will improve that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| The plan is to start construction in January after the holidays are over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1653)|
| 0:27:40| Detour route is North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| None of the local streets are we are not encouraging anybody to use any of the local streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1665)|
| 0:27:57| Let's see. Scope change after we got a bid the previous time we tried that was way above the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1677)|
| 0:28:06| We took one of the two bridges out of the project, which is the one to the east at Sherwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1686)|
| 0:28:15| And the Westland itself, the bridge that we are replacing, will force us to close the road for two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1695)|
| 0:28:35| Jim, did I cover your questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| Yeah, just you and I had a conversation about the concern of traffic being on Craigland or on Craig Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1719)|
| 0:28:46| and the encouragement of people to go around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| Would you just address that a little bit about because I've gotten several phone calls about whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| we can put a light at Westland and Craig and what the city feels about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| I guess people who want to cut through on Craig would like to have a light there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| but it is not a very good place for a light for road alignment issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| and just the nature of that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| And having a temporary light on a relatively high volume, high speed road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1756)|
| 0:29:24| I mean relatively, is not a very good idea because people just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1764)|
| 0:29:32| there's some danger when you first put it in that you'll have a lot of unexpected stops and rear end crashes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| and then just as they're getting used to it, we'll take it out again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| But it would also encourage people to go by way of Craig Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| and the folks on Craig Road have made it very clear that they don't want that used as a detour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1785)|
| 0:29:52| And I think that's a valid concern for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| Will Craig Road at Westland be closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| I mean on the diagram here it shows part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| Will it stay open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| It stays open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| It does stay open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| But you'd have to approach it from the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| Or you'll have to turn west on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| Councilman Delva.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| Yeah, quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| My memory tells me that we've been debating this road work for a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| and there was questions, of course, there's always been questions about water jumping out of the ditch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| crossing across the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| Had we started any of the work or we just kept revising the design and analysis to get what we wanted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| Well, we let the bid, what, March maybe last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1832)|
| 0:30:39| And we only got one bid and it was well above what we had budgeted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| So we could not proceed at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| We drew back and redesigned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Yeah, we re-scoped, scoped it down a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| We also had some of the KUB, some of the associated utility work got done separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1851)|
| 0:30:59| which made it more buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| Part of the issue was requiring them to rebuild a bridge and do a bunch of utility work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1864)|
| 0:31:12| in the same space in a constricted amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| So now what we're doing is we're still constricting the amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| but they only have to do the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| They don't have to do the utility work at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| You're phasing it separately working with KUB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| And the KUB portion of the previous bid was also very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| So neither KUB nor the city could move forward on the original bridge bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| Something was just nagging me that I thought we had already authorized this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| Sort of deja vu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| Jim, thank you for sending out this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| Just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| So you're going to do the bridge on the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| So Sherwood and Westland will remain open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| and you can come down Sherwood and go east on Westland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| Yes, and that's another way that we will not detour people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| It won't be an official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| But you can get that way, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| And you'll be able to go south on Craig Road as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| It just won't be the official detour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| There was also discussion at one time about making that a four-way stop there at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| I don't know, is that Glen Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| What's that road that crosses over Craig Road right in the middle of between Westland and North Shore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| There was one time a discussion about whether that was a possibility to slow that traffic down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| because it's inevitably going to cut through Craig Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| I forget what the name of that street is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| Traffic engineers will inevitably tell you that that's a very bad idea to use four-way stops as a traffic calming method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1968)|
| 0:32:59| It just reduces people's respect for stop signs because a lot of the time there won't be anybody there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1979)|
| 0:33:06| People are going to stop stopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| How true that is, I don't know, but that's what traffic engineers always tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| Well, I guess that would be something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| You're going to have some public meetings, right, before January, before construction starts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| We'll get word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| I don't know that we're not at this time planning to have a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| since we've had one that basically had the same information last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| And fundamentally it hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| It's just the scope of the project has changed a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| So it will be closed for two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| They have six months to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| So there will be through the other four months there will be some lane closures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| but it won't be completely closed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| Yeah, I would encourage you, Jim, maybe to have another public meeting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| We are getting phone calls about it in terms of the schedule and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| And it would probably not be a bad idea to just review what's going to happen in terms of the road traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| The other thing I wanted to point out is out of the million, almost a million eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| KUB is paying $240,000 of that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| So they're a partner in this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| But I move we accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| It will be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| 11G is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a First Amendment to lease agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| with Mainstream Group 7LP for lease of space within the Emporium Building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| locating at 100 South Gay Street to extend the time period to exercise the annex portion option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| Yeah, I'd like for Lisa to come up and give just sort of a heads up in terms of what the organization does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| and the Arts Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| This is your chance to crow a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| Well, you know I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| I know you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| Crow briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| You know me well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| First of all, let me say thank you to Lance Campbell and to Christy Granscom for all their help with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2108)|
| 0:35:19| When the Emporium was first created and we first moved in, it was a very different 100 block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| And we always feel that the arts are at the service of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| And we hope that being there helped get us to where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| And we are looking forward to the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| And we feel like that our role there is as important as the warehouse district becomes more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2135)|
| 0:35:43| And this city pushes northward with its plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| We hope that we can be an anchor for a lot of that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| The Emporium Center is exceptionally lively on First Fridays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| which have become I think a real feather in the cap of the city and downtown redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| Again, thank you to the city for all of its help and support in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| We are working with a number of artists who are appreciating sales and the development of their work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2166)|
| 0:36:15| and nonprofit organizations that continue to thrive there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| And we think help the attractiveness of that block for residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2179)|
| 0:36:26| And also, I was just down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| And for Tuesday night, you would be amazed at all the people that are down there eating and the economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2188)|
| 0:36:37| What we do there, we track, and it is worth millions of dollars of economic benefit to retail residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2197)|
| 0:36:47| and restaurants down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| The annex itself is one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| We don't know if we are going to be able to put together the build-out financing for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| This particular space is important because it has an entryway from Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2218)|
| 0:37:07| So if you are familiar with the Emporium Center, you know that all of those windows are right there at the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2227)|
| 0:37:14| And there is a major entryway into the Emporium Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| And then you have the UT Downtown Gallery and what was Slam Dot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| And then there is a quiet little door that is to this annex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2241)|
| 0:37:29| It's 110 Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| It has never been used for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| It goes downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| It is a storage area now for Dewhurst Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| Why it is important, if we can make something happen and make the numbers work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| is that it would allow people to go down from there through the underground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2262)|
| 0:37:51| which also we have never done anything with, and come back up into the Emporium Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2271)|
| 0:37:58| We are also looking forward to when the work along the Jackson Avenue ramps is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| And that really joins that greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| And when that happens, we understand that that underground will be connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2287)|
| 0:38:13| And so we think that the opportunities are very exciting if we can get a hold of that space and start to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2293)|
| 0:38:20| We have had a jazz fact tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| We're having a jazz jam in the space right next door to it on a Tuesday night from 7 to 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| So we are doing more and more down there to enliven the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| And we do not know whether or not we will be able to find the money to develop it, but we have hopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2313)|
| 0:38:42| We don't know if we will turn it into something that is maybe a juice bar or another place for arts performances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2322)|
| 0:38:51| or art-making activities, but we sure like the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2331)|
| 0:38:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| I just want to say that I serve on the board with Lisa, or I serve at her pleasure, I might say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2340)|
| 0:39:06| and that when she says things might happen, she is a driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| And I just want to say we really do appreciate all you've done and all you've done to help the Arts Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| It's really been great, and I appreciate all you've done for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| This would be a good time to adjourn and go down to hear the jazz music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| That's what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| We do need a motion, so I make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| 11H is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a sub-lease agreement with the Arts and Cultural Alliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| of Greater Knoxville for lease of space within the Emporium Building located at 100 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| 11I is a resolution authorizing the mayor to approve the sale of two decommissioned pickup trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140930?start=2390)|
