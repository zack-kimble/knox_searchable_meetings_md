| 0:01:03| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=63)|
| 0:01:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| Commissioner Smith, would you mind leading us in the Pledge of Allegiance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=66)|
| 0:01:08| Everyone please stand, face the flag, give the proper salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=68)|
| 0:01:14| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=74)|
| 0:01:19| and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=79)|
| 0:01:22| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=82)|
| 0:01:28| Let's hear it for Ms. Brown again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=88)|
| 0:01:42| I don't think they're on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=102)|
| 0:01:47| I bet it could be the City Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=107)|
| 0:01:51| Because I think Carolina Ale House, I think that's in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=111)|
| 0:01:53| That's probably a City Beer Board thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| He probably just Googled Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| Yeah, it's in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| He probably thought it was this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| But, yeah, it's got to be a City Beer Board matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| And today is Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| so the City Beer Board would probably be tomorrow night as part of that city meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| So we both may be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| I apologize to everyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| We just had a constituent call us about a beer board issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| And for those of you who didn't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| there is a separate beer board for both the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| And I think we had someone who freaked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| who's got a city establishment thinking that he needed to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| The first item on our agenda is approval of the minutes from last month's beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| Is there a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=152)|

| 0:07:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| I make a motion to approve pending all needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| including the Health Department final inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| Fire Marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| Final inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| Permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Permit and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| Permit and a final inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| And a final inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| Final inspection and CO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| And as the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| Certificate of registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| Certificate of registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| Certificate of registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| Second came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| Was that Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| So we have a motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| So I do have as part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| But is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| My question is more of a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| You know, we've seen a lot of different establishments come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| And I usually like to Google them before the meeting just to kind of understand what we've got going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| But would you mind sharing with this body a little bit about what you've got planned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| Because to be perfectly blunt, it's a little bit different than most of the rank and file businesses that come before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=481)|
| 0:08:08| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| So in the tabletop gaming community, like board games, card games, miniatures games, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=491)|
| 0:08:18| there's a style of gaming called beer and pretzels gaming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| And basically that just describes a casual game with your friends where everyone is having fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| It's not so much about winning or losing as it is having a social experience, maybe having some beers and good food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| and having a good time, a good social evening with your friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| And locally, my own board gaming group as well as several others, we meet at local bars to play at least once a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=518)|
| 0:08:47| I've wanted to open a tabletop gaming store for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| And when me and my business partner first started discussing what our model would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| I suggested that we try to incorporate beer into the model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| because it's something that a lot of people playing tabletop games are looking for a venue that provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| And if we could be a venue that provides both the beer and the games,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| we could corner both parts of that market at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| and also basically give someone an environment that's about tabletop games instead of just about beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=552)|
| 0:09:21| because, you know, Schultz Brow is beautiful inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| But going there to play board games isn't always ideal because there's trivia nights going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| or people renting out spaces that we typically use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| This will give people that are invested in the tabletop community a dedicated place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| where they can go have a few beers with their friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| and have an environment that's catered directly towards their tabletop needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| We've got tables that were custom built by a woodworker to specifications that meet the needs of several of these games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=583)|
| 0:09:52| Our four main sitting tables are three feet by eight feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| which is large enough to support the play mat used in a normal indie skirmish miniatures game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| of which several will be played in the shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| or host four typical card games with two play mats on each side of the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| So we're trying to both embody that tavern aesthetic and have handmade, handcrafted furniture and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=610)|
| 0:10:18| while also appealing to the modern board gamer and beer enthusiast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| that wants a nice upscale place to have a beer and play their games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| Okay. What is that Catan game?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| Settlers of Catan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| So that's like a worker placement slash territory claiming kind of game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=631)|
| 0:10:37| It's not in my personal top ten. I haven't played it a ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| So more advanced strategies, someone else, maybe one of my customers would be better to help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| But in general, it's about developing an island and it's communal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| Everyone is developing the same one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| And so you're competing with like road placement or livestock management or things like lumber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| I like county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| Only reason why I even know about that game, that's the game that Grant Williams plays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| who used to play for Tennessee basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| So just to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| All right. Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| Are there any additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| This is just a really unique concept and I was wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| is this something you found somewhere else or is this something you've come up with entirely yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| I don't think that the Tabletop Gaming Tavern is necessarily a unique model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| Like even in Knoxville, there's Green's Tavern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| and they do a lot of engagement with the board gaming community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| We're definitely the first in the area to so openly marry the two concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| I think that Green's Tavern would say that they are a bar, not a hobby shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| I'd say that we're both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| No problem. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| Is there any other discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| So make sure you check with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| I know you've got your requirements that you've got to check off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| Also, would you raise your hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Please check in with the young lady in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| I know she's with the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| We'll verify some other things that you may need to get as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| What was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| She's with MDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| We'll check with her and she'll get you all squared away as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Next item on our agenda is the Jada's Food Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| Is the owner present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| The name of the owner is, and there's two that are listed, Balee Hassan Momon Adula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=758)|
| 0:12:48| and Ali Bashir Ibram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| Are any of those two gentlemen present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| We will move that one to next month's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Is there any additional discussion for this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| I think we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Does Commissioner Anders want to make a motion to that effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| Because I think we need to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| You need to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| We move it to next month's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| Second from Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| I'll have to move this forward to next month's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| All opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| Is there any additional discussion items for the Knox County Beer Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| I know we have some guests here from the journalism department, so thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| So appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| And this meeting is officially closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200224beer?start=824)|
