| 0:01:25| you mind sharing information regarding executive session? I'd be happy to. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=85)|
| 0:01:31| Madam Chair. Yes, it was a regularly scheduled executive session and that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=91)|
| 0:01:36| time for the board to hear from our law department about pending litigation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=96)|
| 0:01:43| proposed litigation. It was just a time for the board to hear from us. The board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=103)|
| 0:01:49| did not deliberate any issues or discuss the any issues amongst themselves. It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=109)|
| 0:01:55| an exception to the Open Meetings Act under Smith County Education Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=115)|
| 0:02:01| versus Anderson and at least one other case. Thank you. Thank you. Just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=121)|
| 0:02:08| reminder that our meeting schedule has changed for 2022 and we will now be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=128)|

| 0:02:46| Wednesday, January 19th at 4 p.m. in the Andrew Johnson building boardroom. Are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=166)|
| 0:02:53| there any requested changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=173)|
| 0:02:58| Do we have a move to approve by Ms. Horne? Is there a second? Second by Mr. Watson. All in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=178)|
| 0:03:06| favor? Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries. And so next we will have our internal school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=186)|
| 0:03:15| funds audit report and Mr. McPherson, do you want to lead into this for us? Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=195)|
| 0:03:22| you, thank you Madam Chair. We have our auditors here today. I think Ted Hoats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| from Pew is going to present. Hello, thank you Ron and Madam Chair. I believe as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=206)|
| 0:03:36| attached to the agenda you have a copy of the audit report and also a copy of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=216)|
| 0:03:42| the governance letter which I will go over here in a moment. I'm going to focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| on the compliance section because that's the area that gets the most attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| but I will also briefly talk about the governance letter which was attached and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| also go over some general numbers. On the governance letter first since it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=238)|
| 0:04:05| shorter, this is basically a general communication between audit firms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| directly to a board, a finance committee, in this case the Board of Education. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| basically discusses required communications and what our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| responsibilities are, planned scope and timing of the audit, significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| accounting practices, basically if you follow the bolded areas of the first two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| pages of the letter. There were no significant audit adjustments made. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| mentions or references internal control matters and compliance findings. Sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| there won't be information in the letter but instead it will reference to another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| document or reference to the audit report. In this case the compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| findings are referenced to the bound audit report or I'm so used to saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| bound audit report, the PDF copy of the audit report and a copy of the management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| representation is attached to this letter. That is basically what management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| has represented to us and that's basically the governance letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| Typically there'd be more content in here because there'd be a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| estimates or other information but this is a really, while the audit of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| internal school funds is a lot of work, it's still a simple balance sheet so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| there's not estimates or a lot of assumptions made as part of the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| It's just a lot of testing. With that I will, if there are no questions on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| letter, I'll skip to the audit report itself and as general information, of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| course this is a huge report, I'm going to spend most of the time in the very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| back of it, but in the very beginning is right after, I guess the second page, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=343)|
| 0:05:51| the table of contents. So this is the different areas of the report. Our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| independent auditor's report, combined financial statements, then individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| school statements. One thing in this PDF copy that's different this year from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| last year, if you want to look at the school activity for a particular school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=366)|
| 0:06:12| all you need to do in this case go to the table of contents and click on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| link. The table of contents, the blue area basically represents a link so you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=377)|
| 0:06:24| can click on the link and go directly to that school. I'll step back for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| minute and remind everybody that we are auditing, this report is on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| internal school funds, which means it's basically the checkbook that's held at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=394)|
| 0:06:40| each individual school and we audit each individual school, all approximately 90| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| schools separately. It does not include the finances of the central office, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| that is part of the audit report that's included in the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=411)|
| 0:06:57| government report. They're separate schedules for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| schools, they're basically the central office activity at that point. So this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| just really the activity at the individual schools, but it's still a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| of activity and that's where it requires a lot of testing. Like I said, we do test a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| significant number of transactions at each school, receipts, disbursements, look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| at all sorts of supporting documentation. But, you know, again, if you want to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| at a particular school, all you got to do is go to the table of contents, click on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| the link and it should take you right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| Okay, I will jump forward then to the audit report, well not very far, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=453)|
| 0:07:40| really right after the table of contents, and if you, it's a three-page report, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| this is your standard internal audit report for a Tennessee school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=465)|
| 0:07:52| internal school funds. I say that because there's some unique language in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| This report is in compliance with the Tennessee state manual instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| generally accepted accounting principles. So it states in the report that it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| in compliance with GAAP, but instead in compliance with regulatory basis as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| required by the state of Tennessee. So if you're looking at the report and, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| know, trying to follow along the language, just keep in mind this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| standard, basically, clean opinion report that a school system for internal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| school funds report would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| Right after the audit report, opinion section are the combined statements. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=508)|
| 0:08:36| you can see the activity from each individual school here in summary form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| and I'm not going to go over that in any way except to say that the total cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=520)|
| 0:08:47| held at the end of the year, at the end of the year was June 30 of 2021, was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| roughly 12 million dollars held in the checking accounts for all the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| so at the school level. So that's still a healthy amount of money, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=538)|
| 0:09:05| kind of shown on the bottom of page two in the first column. And then as far as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| also like to point out what the total revenues and expenditures are in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=550)|
| 0:09:16| funds for all schools, that's on the bottom of page four. Total revenues were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| about 13.1 million, and total expenditures about 13.4 million. So a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| a lot of small transactions, but a lot of dollars still involved, you know, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| this is as well, really the last two years, less activity because we've been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=573)|
| 0:09:40| you know, dealing with COVID, and so it's a lot less activities at the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| level, because these numbers have been as high as 20 million dollars of ins and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| outs. So regardless, still a lot of activity goes to the schools, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| that's why these funds are required to be audited, because just as we'll get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| into in the other section, only so many controls in place just because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| limited accounting personnel, limited number of accounting personnel, so that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| why an audit is required. So I'll skip forward to the finding section, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=612)|
| 0:10:18| on report on that two-page report. First of all, that's on pages 338 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=618)|
| 0:10:26| 339, and then the actual findings themselves start on page 340 and go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=626)|
| 0:10:33| through page, well, it's 340 is our report number page, if you're following the PDF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=633)|
| 0:10:39| the PDF page is 351, so, and I'm not going to go through these in detail. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=639)|
| 0:10:49| will instead focus on the summary page, which is page 351, our report number 351,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=649)|
| 0:10:58| probably roughly 362 from a PDF page number. This list, the prior year findings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=658)|
| 0:11:05| I'm going to go kind of compare current year to prior year. The findings were in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=665)|
| 0:11:12| the area of segregation of duties, they went up a little bit, the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| instances, negative fund balances was two, disbursements three, finding four is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=677)|
| 0:11:25| receipts, number five is purchase order, six is ticket reconciliations, seven is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=685)|
| 0:11:31| fundraising and resale activities, eight school support organizations, nine was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=691)|
| 0:11:40| approval of transfers, ten a year ago was travel policy, that one has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| corrected, so that's a good thing. Unclaimed property repeats, and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=706)|
| 0:11:53| one new finding, and that is, I believe it's listed as number 11, confirm, yes, 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=713)|
| 0:12:00| this year, and that's on class accounts. While it's listed as a new finding, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=720)|
| 0:12:07| really is not a new issue, it's been combined in another issue in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| it's just a focus area from the state, since it's a focus area from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=731)|

| 0:12:23| these findings compared current year to prior year, we had an increase in four of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| them, an increase in number of instances, a decrease in three of them, three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| findings were about the same, and one was resolved, so from that standpoint, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| that's a decrease too, and then one issue that's related to another issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| that's been pulled out as a separate one this year, so in reality, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| number of instances are pretty similar across the board to prior years, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=771)|

| 0:13:51| instances, I kind of compare our instances up, down, or about the same, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=831)|

| 0:14:39| So do we have any questions right now, anybody? Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=879)|
| 0:14:46| And as well, if questions come up, you're welcome to route them through Ron or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=886)|

| 0:15:32| based on a winter weather warning that was issued through 10 a.m. by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=932)|

| 0:15:40| this regard. While we recognize the importance of in-service days to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| preparations for a new semester, we did feel it was necessary to err on the side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| of caution given the potential for hazardous road conditions this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| On a related note, I do encourage our students, families, and employees to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| sure that they have a plan in place for inclement weather. The months of January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| February, and sometimes even March can be unpredictable, and the district does have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| several weather days available in case of snow, ice, or other hazardous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| conditions. Also, there may be days when we delay school for an hour or two, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| please think about contingency plans or delays such as this. While we cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| avoid all the disruptions caused by the weather, having a plan in place can help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| our families and employees mitigate those disruptions. We look forward to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| having our staff and students back at school tomorrow as we start a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=988)|

| 0:17:57| excited to be here tonight to talk through some of our academic initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| and some of our priorities for District 1. We've brought to you quite a bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| information that we have gathered through needs assessments that started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| last summer. We've continued to work into the fall with developing our ESSER plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| and out of that we have determined three areas that I'm going to focus on tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| and then also focusing on a District 1 feeder pattern initiative that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| in motion, and first I want to say these are the initiatives that we're focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| on. They're funded through multiple streams. Some of them have some general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| purpose funding. A lot of them are accelerated because of ESSER, but we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| also braided in some of our title dollars in order to build out some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| sustainability, so I'll be happy to talk through that as we as we go through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| presentation. As soon as I figure out the clicker, there it goes. Okay, so our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1126)|
| 0:18:54| academic initiatives. The three that I'm focusing on right now are the K2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1134)|
| 0:19:00| Reading Foundational Skills Initiative, our 6.8 Algebra 1 Foundational Math, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1140)|
| 0:19:06| then looking at career exploration and reimagining high schools. These three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| emerged as our top initiatives as we looked at the impact of our COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| closures, the disruptions last year, and then also thinking about the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| that we have put into these three initiatives and how we can use these, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| funds we have available to us right now, to accelerate the direction we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| go. We know that in each of these three areas, we have really great teachers. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1170)|
| 0:19:37| have curriculum in place that aligns to these standards and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| builds in a sequential fashion so that our students get what they need from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| kindergarten through 12th grade, and we've invested in pre-k so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| the students who are in pre-k are getting those early foundational skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| But using the funds available to us right now, we're looking at how we take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| what we have and invest deeply in these three areas, make these three areas a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| priority, so that we can make sure we're maximizing the resources that we've put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| into them. K2 reading foundational skills, we know that this is the critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| time for our students to build those reading skills, and that's foundational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| to everything else that they do in school. So that is one of the reasons why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| this is a very big priority for us. In looking at both Knox County, the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| and the country, middle grades math has suffered quite a bit in the last several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| years, and the outcome of that is Algebra I. So really putting some good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| attention into middle grades math and through that also looking at building a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| pipeline of middle grades math teachers is one of our priorities that I'll talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| about in a few minutes. And then reimagining high school, and a lot of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| have been involved in some of that work, so I'll touch on that a little bit as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| get into that. But then we also have the District 1 priority, and in that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| looking at working with our principals in District 1 and understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1262)|
| 0:21:09| with them what are our needs, what are our assets, and how do we use what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| available to us now to get a surge in District 1. So we've had an initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| planning meeting, and I'll share that as we move forward. Okay, so K-2 foundational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1280)|
| 0:21:28| skills. Some direct student support that you'll see here is we are participating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| in the Tennessee All-Core tutoring. We have hired someone to coordinate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| and work with the state, and so we are starting our first run with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1297)|
| 0:21:44| that tutoring will be in the spring. We've already contacted some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| schools and are looking to hire tutors to work in K-2 foundational reading and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1308)|
| 0:21:55| in 6.8 math. So as we're looking in the foundational skills reading, what we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| learned is that the tutoring is effective when it's a constrained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| skill. So when it is learning the alphabet, learning the letter names and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| sounds, those are places where a tutor can really help a child to accelerate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| and working with our curriculum. So our tutors will be trained in understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| the curriculum, knowing what's coming up, working with the teacher so that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| are working it with a very small number of students. It's a one to three ratio to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| help those students accelerate those skills so that we can have them on grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1346)|

| 0:22:42| the components of reading and what it looks like to help a child develop those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| skills. And we have our teachers creating some videos and some resources that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| parents can use or caregivers can use to help support those skills at home so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| that they have that access. We have that for math as well, the K-2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1376)|

| 0:23:43| something we've been working on with Sunnyview and with Maynard, aligning our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| materials to that vision, making sure that we have data and assessments so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| that both the teachers and the schools can look at that information and make in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1432)|

| 0:24:39| doing some of the walkthroughs and and working with with teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1479)|

| 0:24:46| to be and how do we help to make sure that all of our minutes in instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| are spent doing the intense work of teaching students to read. So how we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| going about and supporting this, we have been working with instruction partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| and you'll see we want to continue that work. You'll see something on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1501)|

| 0:25:27| to get the results that they would like to be getting with their students. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| then progress monitoring, setting up what are the data points that we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1531)|

| 0:25:38| the informal data that we need to be gathering. And that one of the really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| beneficial parts of that was the focus group with the teachers where the nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| thing with the external partner is everybody from Knox County left the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1546)|

| 0:25:53| with us what the teachers had to say. So that helped inform us of what we needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| to do to be supportive of them. And that's we're having that external| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| evaluation is helpful as well. So as we look at that, this is our literacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| and numeracy vision for Knox County schools. It's small. I hope you can I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1567)|

| 0:26:20| we believe that all students can and will read proficiently and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1580)|
| 0:26:27| they'll be able to work flexibly with numbers. It's really important for us for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| people to understand that we're not talking about fast when we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| about working fluently with both reading and with math. We are talking about their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| ability to think flexibly for them to be able to read at the rate of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| speech and to have expression so that they're conveying they understand what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| they're reading as they read it. And when we talk about fluency with numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| we're talking about fluency in terms of if you think about water moving through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1614)|

| 0:27:03| fluidly move around that rock. So with math they may find another way to arrive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| at that answer if they understand how numbers work. So that's what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| working for in terms of fluency. We do see that reading is the the predictor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1631)|
| 0:27:18| high school graduation and continuing education and so is that that algebra 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| is a really important indicator as well. So that's why we have that that algebra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| focus. We are committed to solidifying the foundational literacy skills and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| strong number sense in line with the Tennessee state standards. And with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| we're aligning our high quality instructional materials which includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| explicit foundational skills instruction as well as knowledge of the world. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| one of the differences that we see in curriculum now versus curriculum 15-20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1666)|
| 0:27:53| years ago. It's that consistent build in knowledge so that students have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| knowledge and the understanding that gives them the background knowledge to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| be able to develop as proficient readers. We want students to be able to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| talk, and write about numbers and we want them to be able to read, talk, and write| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| about texts every day in their classrooms. And as I said we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| at having when we talk about reading proficiently they're reading complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| grade level text accurately with an appropriate rate which is conversational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| with expression and with understanding. So they can read it as they read it they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| have the prosody it sounds like they understand what they're reading but they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| can also tell us after they've read it a little summary of what they've read. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| so we're looking to support everybody in building a culture around reading and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| writing and we are also working to build a culture around the wonder and joy of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1730)|

| 0:29:04| to develop a school vision that fits in with this vision but is specific to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| their school. And what we see developing over time is that we these are our two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| pilot schools they're helping us to figure out how this work. They're giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| us the insight of how this works at a school level and then we plan to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| six more schools next year and then move to 25 more schools the year after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| By that point what we've seen happen is that it becomes part of the culture of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| how we do things and the other schools are taking a lead and helping to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| that work. So that's what we that's what we anticipate will happen here. We have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1777)|

| 0:31:20| for an illness or something like that. So we're really trying to be cognizant of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| how we could invest in developing our our number of math teachers who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1883)|
| 0:31:30| available to us. So again we are working on identifying an external vendor to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| help us with this work and we're looking to pilot with two schools. In this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| we're looking for two schools that have a large number of multilingual learners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| and economically disadvantaged students because those are the two groups of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1906)|

| 0:31:56| disruption. And also as we look at the because math is so language-based if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| look at our multi-language learners and invest in some of those strategies it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| really will help all students to succeed in math. So again looking to continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1926)|

| 0:32:41| our vision for what what high schools look like. How do we partner with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| communities and what does professional development look like as we start to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| shift our thinking into helping our students really think about high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| as a place to to start thinking about the career pathway. Whether they choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| their career pathway in high school or they just start to understand how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| make a plan and how to ask good questions and get the experiences they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| need in order to make decisions about what they want to do after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| Because whether our students are going through high school and going straight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| to work or going through a terminal PhD program at the end of the day we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| want them to have employment if that's what they choose or to enlist or to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| enroll or to to stay home and and do what they want to do at home. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| whatever our kids want to do we want them to have the choice to be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| that and to know how to set themselves up and make a plan for that option. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| advising here is really important and advising not just with counselors but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2024)|
| 0:33:50| with everybody in the schools knowing and understanding how to have those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| conversations with students so that they see the endgame is is post high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| not not during high school. So here we have our partner Ford Next Generation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| Learning. We've gone through the explore phase. We've gone through the envisioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| phase and we're in the master planning phase. So we are I think January 25th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| having our third master planning session to look at all the independent plans and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2054)|
| 0:34:21| to figure out the interdependencies so that we have a starting point for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| actually starting to implement the work. Again we're progress monitoring what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| this looks like and working with external evaluation to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| we're getting from this work what we want. So in in all three of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| initiatives we're really looking to make sure that our students we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| lot of students who do well in Knox County schools but we also have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| students who need more attention and more strategic support and all three of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| these initiatives are really focused on making sure that we are identifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| every student who needs those individual supports and is getting what they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| to be successful. So with that I mentioned that we have the district one feeder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2096)|
| 0:35:03| pattern strategic planning meetings. This is we've had an initial meeting where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| pulled together all of the principals from district one and we did a SOAR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| analysis with them. So broke up into groups. This was all done on post-it notes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| and then we had a really robust conversation around it but really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| thinking through like what are our strengths. So what we identified in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| strengths is that you know the admins champion the initiatives in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| schools. There's a lot of trust between admin and central office for trying some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| things and and having conversations around what will work and what's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| won't work. There is a whole child approach and a heavy focus on social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| emotional. They feel very supported by the community and know that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| community is invested in the school and so there's a lot of strength to build on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| here. We saw opportunities as you know we need to do a better job of helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| teachers visit each other's classrooms and see what's happening across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| different schools and through the grade bands and that's actually something we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| hear across all of our schools. Our fifth grade teachers really want a chance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| see sixth grade. Our sixth grade teachers want a chance to see fifth grade. Eighth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| grade teachers want a chance to see ninth grade and ninth grade wants a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| chance to see eighth grade. When they change buildings that's where we lose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| some of the continuity so as the feeder one principals were talking that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| something that we've heard from from most of our schools. So they see an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2187)|
| 0:36:34| opportunity for recruiting and retaining experienced teachers for their school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| for their schools and you know maybe even going as far as developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| some kind of PDS program or which is something we used to have a professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| development school where student teachers were embedded in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| Coursework was taught both by university faculty as well as teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| in the school so there was the theory of educational theory matched with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| practitioner experience so as they're talking about the theories of classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| management teachers were presenting and here's what that looks like in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| classrooms and then sending them out to do classroom visits that looked like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| that so that's a professional development school. They also talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| about the Urban Specialist Certificate that UTK once offered for veteran| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2234)|
| 0:37:22| teachers to go through and really think about what are the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| specifically with urban education. That was a five-year federal grant with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| six-year rollover so that hasn't been available in a while but is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| something along those lines that we could think of because they said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| was a very valuable component of several years ago when that was a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2256)|
| 0:37:43| Aspirations, they would like a full advanced academic identity that they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| talk about kindergarten through twelfth grade so if you're at Sarah Moore Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| talking with a kindergarten parent you can say to that parent here's what it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| looks like over the next 12 years and as you graduate from Austin East High| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| School here's what you can walk away with and so we actually that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| that we want for all of our feeder patterns as well. So again they'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2285)|
| 0:38:13| for us to continue to to think about the feeder pattern and create a culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| where they can recruit that you know other schools aren't recruiting away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2299)|
| 0:38:25| from their school they have the programming and everything that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| need in order to hold the students in their district. And then results you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| they're looking for a way to track their data day to day so that's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| we're working to help them with. Benchmarking skills and gaps in student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| learning and successes in student learning. They're looking for better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| academic growth and achievement over time specifically with regard to reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| and math and then they also would like some help making sure students learn how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| to self-regulate so that they can decrease the barriers to student success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| and then also reduce chronic absenteeism. So these were the initial challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| that they brought to us and the successes and the strengths to build on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| so we've got a rich starting place. We plan to continue to have meetings with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| them to understand what resources do we need to bring to the table. We understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| we're horizon watchers so we are able to see from 30,000 feet what what options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| are available but the the people working in our schools are the ones with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| insight. They know the context they know what will work so our job is to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| this information they've brought to us and then bring them some some options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| and some strategies and give them the support they need to implement for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| their students. So that's the direction that these meetings are going and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| look forward to continuing this dialogue. So with that I will answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2389)|
| 0:39:59| Ms. Bam. I have a question and I don't know that it's exactly in this but when we talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2399)|
| 0:40:05| about math and our retention of teachers I was just curious on middle and high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| school math teachers are they able to teach kind of like at the college level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| where you maybe just come in and teach one algebra class a semester or do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| not really do that? I just didn't know if that was a way to recruit people or if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| we even had the ability to do that. I think I might let Scott Bolton answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| that question. It's a licensure question I believe. Is it are you asking if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| can teach one out of their licensure area? No more just kind of like when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| look at a college level and you'll have a teacher come in and just teach one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| psychology class for a semester and not have a full load. I didn't know if we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| that kind of ability at the obviously not in elementary school but I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| know in middle and high school if we had the ability for a teacher to come in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| just teach one class or something like that. That that that's a possibility given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2450)|
| 0:40:57| that the person is adequately licensed. A lot of times when you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| with with math teachers it's very difficult to find those that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2460)|
| 0:41:05| adequately licensed. The standard math licensure will range from sixth grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| all the way through twelfth grade which will range from concepts from pre-algebra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| all the way through calculus that they'll be licensed to teach and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| would love to have somebody who may want to step in and maybe teach a class here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| or teach a class there but a lot of times there's a lot of to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| certification you actually have to have a degree in the area so you have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| Bachelor of Arts in math and then take additional course hours above and beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| the required to get the certification so it's very difficult to find people. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| will find folks to do job embedded so that they're in the field but the the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| practice the the practice exam is very difficult so there's there's the change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| in the licensing at the state level so. So really at the middle and high I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| really for us it's harder to teach than at a college level it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| Absolutely is. There's yeah at the college level if you have a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2518)|

| 0:42:14| Watson. Thank you Madam Chair. Two questions. Can you say a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| about the scholarship the approach to trying to gain math teachers and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2539)|
| 0:42:25| more specificity around that. Sure and we are in the beginning stages of that of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| that initiative so I can tell you what I what I know about it right now and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| finance and HR can jump in if I get it wrong but we are what we've set aside in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| our ESSER dollars is to identify so two different ways that we can do this. One| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2559)|
| 0:42:45| we just had some some December graduates who are licensed in math. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| think it was three. So they all may get hired. I wouldn't be surprised if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| are already hired but if not we have in our ESSER dollars we are able to hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| them as apprentice and then assign them to an existing math teacher so that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| can continue that existing math teacher would would get a stipend for supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| that apprentice teacher but that way they are employed with us and then if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| have an opening they get an extended time to learn Knox County schools and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| learn to teach math with somebody who is both willing and able to help them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| develop their skills but then if we have an opening we then would be able to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| them into that open spot and that would be the agreement with them when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| when they come into the position. The other way that we could identify some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| math teachers I we budgeted an ESSER to identify 17 of the tutors over the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| three years who maybe are in an engineering degree or some other math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| heavy degree where they're taking a lot of math classes there may be two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| into that program and deciding that they don't actually want to be an engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| but now they have to go home and say I don't want to be an engineer anymore and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| I've invested all this money in being an engineer but if we are able to say to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| them we'll cover the last two years of going through school if you then owe us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| three years of service for teaching math identifying those who are really who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| doing a good job and seem to be really valuing the experience of teaching math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| and we think we may be able to identify some people who who then might not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| otherwise have gone into a math program and do it maybe as a I don't think with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| those we could do it as a grow your own because they don't have a degree yet so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| that's that's where we have and are you unearthing them primarily through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| relationships with like the departments that they're in like how are you how are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| we identifying these folks yes that would be through both the departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| they're in the principals and our math department would there they will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| doing a lot of well no I mean the the potential people we might have to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| in to take advantage of this at the university level who are in an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| engineering program how are we through through the tutoring initiative so as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| are hiring people to be tutors for us then we would be either because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| don't have to be fully degreed to be a tutor they can be a they can be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| student at the university and so through building the relationships with them as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| tutors and the university is helping us to to identify tutors for different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| schools well I was just going to add to that and talking about there's two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2725)|
| 0:45:31| pathways so we're hoping if we get them early on in their college experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| then potentially they can go the traditional education pathway to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| certified however if they're really close to completing their degree we also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| have a job embedded placement opportunity for them where they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| come in be the teacher of record we work with a mad support and then they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| completing their courses through the educator prep program so those are two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| options that we would go for for the purpose of licensure my last question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2756)|
| 0:46:03| you talked about you've not yet identified the schools for the math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| pilot when's the gold identify them so our math department is talking with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| schools next week so we think we know so in doing the data analysis we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2771)|
| 0:46:19| have a methodology through federal budgets in order to identify schools and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| so our methodology has identified two schools and we're going out to talk with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| them to see if they are in a position to do that we think they will be they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| been very very engaged in the work we've been doing but I don't I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| want to identify them until the schools have said that it is a match for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| well I really appreciate the work and the presentation and the all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| analysis that's gone on it around assets and deficits and how we can work to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| strengths and our capacities and especially in a targeted way like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| so thanks for bringing it thank you madam chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| hey Shannon thank you for bringing this I know I've communicated with you a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| little bit about some concerns I've heard from teachers and parents around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| so this would be kind of district curriculum topics but but I think one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2828)|
| 0:47:15| thing that you mentioned that I think may explain some of the concerns that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2835)|
| 0:47:20| I'm hearing the literacy you said that now it's changed and there's more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2840)|
| 0:47:27| knowledge of the world included in curriculum and I think that's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| the difference that does that make sense that that's the difference that parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| and teachers are seeing that are concerning because I think some of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| has been with fourth fifth and into the middle grades that the topics are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2861)|
| 0:47:47| their view too heavy for for them and so that's so I think that's does that do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2867)|
| 0:47:56| you think that explains why I'm hearing these concerns it could I think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| a lot that's new and we always hear a lot of this when there is a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| curriculum I think and that's where I think having our process is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| important so that when we hear a complaint then they can tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2889)|
| 0:48:14| specifically what the the complaint is and we can look at that specific concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2894)|
| 0:48:20| and that's how we've been addressing and our curriculum company has been great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| in elementary about making changes and in fact they've gotten in front of some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| of them so I think part of it yes it's new and and one of the things that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2910)|
| 0:48:37| discovered with one of the grade levels is that the teachers just didn't feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| comfortable with the content because it was content they didn't know so you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| when in thinking as an English teacher I really knows the things I have taught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| over time or the things I studied and so that's a place where UT is helping us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2932)|
| 0:48:59| as well because in some cases it was just not having background knowledge in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| a particular in a particular area and just giving the teacher some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2943)|
| 0:49:10| background knowledge gave them more latitude to make the adjustments they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| needed to make for their students such as you mean like if it was history that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| they're that they're using in their English curriculum something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| what you mean it could be or I mean because there are history topics there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| science topics there's art topics there you know and so I did not have speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2966)|
| 0:49:33| for myself I did not know a lot about the art topics until I had a curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| of teaching and advanced placement and we had to do a comparison between an art| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| piece and a poem and I knew the poem really well I didn't know a whole lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| about the art piece so you know having to really learn how do I talk about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| piece of art and compare it to this poem was something that I needed support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| doing so we're finding some things like that in the curriculum too and looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| for some partners and some professional development but that I mean that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| to mitigate there are some things where you know if people have found something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| concerning then we have a process for them to bring that concern so that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| can review it and and make a decision no curriculum is going to be perfect and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3011)|
| 0:50:18| that's why we need really good teachers who understand how to make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| adjustments to the curriculum okay and that's another thing that had that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| heard that I've expressed to you that some concern about whether teachers are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| able to be flexible in adjusting to what they feel like they their students have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| mastered and moving on to new to a new concept or whatever that is you know can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| you talk about the flexibility that you expect for teachers to be able to react| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| to what's actually happening in their class yes and that's a lot of the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| we're doing with with Maynard and Sunnyview is working with them and going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| through learning walks and help helping us figure out how we have those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| conversations so it's really about learning the intentionality behind the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| design so and I can talk about this with the first time we implemented a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3063)|
| 0:51:09| curriculum like this was four years ago and you know we said in year one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| implement it the way it's written so that you understand how all the pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| come together because what we discovered as we were going through it and kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| making changes and adjustments we didn't realize till we got to the assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| that a piece that we didn't think was important and we skipped it was a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| important piece for the assessment that was coming up and that was something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| that built over time the ELA standards don't come to mastery until the end of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| grade level and so there's this constant spiraling and building throughout the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| year so what we are what what we're trying to get people to see is that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3104)|
| 0:51:51| they understand the design and can see not just the one lesson but to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3111)|

| 1:03:43| elementary grades so we would expect that there would be something there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| and you know what we'll be looking at to make a recommendation on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3828)|

| 1:05:18| consider adding this language to policy I 340 so that we could have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3918)|
| 1:05:26| clarification on exactly what is expected there. I know we've gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| several emails from parents who have been concerned about special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3931)|

| 1:05:48| I think including this language under 11 would be helpful so I'll make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3948)|
| 1:05:54| motion Wednesday. So any discussion on F? Mr. Watson. Thank you Madam Chair. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3954)|
| 1:06:05| debating whether or not to bring this up under policy labeled E or when we talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| about the legislative agenda but TSBA over the holidays sent out to all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3970)|

| 1:06:25| policy around third grade retention. It's something that depending on how the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3985)|
| 1:06:32| discussion maybe goes later but again it ties into this policy too it might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| something for the board to consider if we feel strongly about including or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=3995)|
| 1:06:42| giving or asking for the opportunity for us to include district level data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| and making that decision and that determination is to possibly look at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| draft resolution like TSBA to potentially send and approve some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4010)|

| 1:08:06| Madam Chair. It's just fun to say A A and B B and all that stuff isn't it? We don't get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| lot to do that a lot. So this question is around D D. So I was reading back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| through some of these with a little bit different lens over the holidays I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| reading through I think I mentioned in the past in these meetings that some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| my kids have 504s and recently we've gone through the process of potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4102)|
| 1:08:27| getting an IEP for our son and so I was reading through that very long report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| from that and so I was kind of reading through some of this with a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| lens on that policy J 552 on line 22 on the first page. Special education data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4114)|
| 1:08:46| seems to be a very big area and I'm curious I know Mr. Myers is not here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| tonight I'm curious if anybody can speak to what kind of official special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4131)|
| 1:08:56| education data and documentation do we keep and retain for the purpose of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| policy because again I just I've been weeding through a lot of it with my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| family and I'm trying to figure out what what might be official it's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| personal question I'm just trying to figure out what's included in that broad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| category. Mr. DuPont. Thank you Madam Chair Mr. Watson I can start John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| Roswick may want to jump in too but I mean this policy basically refers to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4157)|
| 1:09:23| fact that any type of special education data that is individualized is is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4163)|
| 1:09:30| educational record for that particular student and must be protected unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| there's some type of an exception to disclose that data. Now you know a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| times there might be you know a school may need to share between another school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| or something like that but but certainly that's that's very sensitive data that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| that would not be released without a very good reason. But like you just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| mentioned school to school internally it could within the system. Sure okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| absolutely. Okay Dr. Roswick is there anything you wanted to add I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| again it was more about what types of special education data is included in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| that and if it's everything that we have that's fine but if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| something that would not be included in that I'd be interested in that. I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4211)|
| 1:10:16| typically be everything that's in there students have a separate file if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| have an IEP that CCR is what we call it that travels with that student as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| move from school to school and they're grade level transitions or anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| and that can include information a lot of it now is electronic and kept in like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| an easy IEP where they have that in order to be able to process that through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| so that that does follow student through their till graduation and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| there's a set time we keep those as well you know post that time so it pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| much would be my understand everything that would be in that file that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4242)|
| 1:10:46| discussed at an IEP or those sorts of things that were there. Thank you. So any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4246)|
| 1:10:54| more discussion on policies? So moving on to grants items and A, A or B? C or D? Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4254)|

| 1:11:30| implementation of that approach across more elementary schools or is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4290)|
| 1:11:36| something that we're seeing just an isolated situations I don't know who can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| speak to that just I know I mean in terms of who's here do we have a sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4301)|
| 1:11:48| of whether or not calming corners are being used in a lot of different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| elementary schools or? I can say just anecdotally I'm seeing more of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| Seeing more? Dr. Roslick. Yeah the only thing I'd add to that is I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4314)|
| 1:11:59| that we we don't have you know formal budget items for like a rollout of X| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4319)|

| 1:12:07| through grants that schools will obtain but I would say the practice of doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| that and setting up spaces for that is you know to the extent schools have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| space to be able to do that I think it's something that they're finding I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| don't know that we have data on it to see you know this this child doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4340)|

| 1:12:27| of again to miss Owens point anecdotally will say having that space and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| option for a student during those times is beneficial. Okay I'm not gonna ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4351)|

| 1:13:23| which is where the academic side comes in so just curious as as we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4403)|

| 1:15:05| happening with the BEP formula is probably going to happen this legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| session so I had asked you know the superintendent and you know if he had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4511)|
| 1:15:19| items that were of special concern to him for us to consider so and I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| appreciate the work you all put in to providing that as well and did you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4524)|
| 1:15:30| to speak to that or just a concern of course I think last year I know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4530)|
| 1:15:37| term hold harmless I think has been sort of changed for this coming year and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| that's what we used last year I guess in the dialogue and and I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| importance around that is when we when we look at what held harmless meant for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| us this year we would have lost six million dollars I believe it was Ron| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4550)|
| 1:15:54| what in terms of funding had we not been held harmless of the BEP funding so so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4554)|
| 1:16:00| guess the concern is it just with a new formula if that's implemented this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| or whenever we do get to start getting funding estimates from the state what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4565)|
| 1:16:12| would like to see is that we because we still have a decrease in enrollment I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| think maybe a couple thousand students from where we were pre-COVID so and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| added personnel because again taking looking at mental supports emotional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| social all the kinds of supports for kids we've we've we've used money to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| hire some additional folks so you know we don't want to see a reduction in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| funding I would like to see an increase actually and and we know with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| experience growth has been really good for us this year so far with sales taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| then and I think that's occurring across the state too so we just want to be sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| that that whatever the funding mechanism is we don't lose funds and if we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| make sure that we get growth based on all the funds Ron brought up a real good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| point this morning as we were talking you know what what would it look like I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| think when it's important to ask when this new formula is put into place what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| is the difference between what we would have gotten had the formula not changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| as in comparison what we're getting with the formula change because I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| you know that that's going to tell us a lot right there so we just felt like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4636)|
| 1:17:21| important that the legislators we have a conversation with them as they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| talking about this to make sure that funding is you know we continue to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| increases and get growth and and that we don't actually move backwards you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| this which I don't think the intent is for that to happen but again I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| need to need to make sure on the front end we're asking the right questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| about funding in the formula and Ron can talk if I've left out anything so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4664)|
| 1:17:52| we're good miss Ellen Thank You madam chair I included that language in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4672)|
| 1:17:58| final version that I submitted as well for consideration the the concern I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4678)|
| 1:18:04| would have is that when our legislators talked about the hold harmless language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| I think those two words may may be concerning for them because they were so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4689)|
| 1:18:15| adamant that that they would not do that twice so that's that is a concern to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4695)|
| 1:18:23| just that just really those two words however in their most recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4703)|
| 1:18:29| conversations that I have seen with Commissioner Swinn giving updates to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| governor there was a lot of discussion about not reducing current funding so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4715)|
| 1:18:44| think if there is some way to say hold harmless and not reduce current funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4724)|
| 1:18:49| I think that will go a lot further with our legislators because it would be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4729)|
| 1:18:54| more along the lines of continuing current funding in this new formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4734)|
| 1:19:01| instead of looking so directly at ADM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4741)|
| 1:19:10| Thank You madam chair I think that's a really good point miss Owen and and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4750)|
| 1:19:15| Thomas touched on this too I would be surprised if we received less less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4755)|
| 1:19:22| funding than we did this year due to such significant growth what what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4762)|
| 1:19:29| concerns me though is the point that Mr. Thomas made that we were talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4769)|
| 1:19:35| about just this morning that we could actually see an increase in dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4775)|
| 1:19:42| which would actually align with what Miss Swinn said but does that mean that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4782)|
| 1:19:51| we would have gotten the same amount of increase under the BEP formula or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| the concern I have is once the new funding model comes into place and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4795)|
| 1:20:03| the state were to say see we we told you nobody would get hurt but there is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4803)|
| 1:20:09| unknown factor about well what did the formula really do for Knott's County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| schools and I think it's in I would love to see that once this new formula takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4813)|
| 1:20:19| into or becomes effective how that compares with what the formula or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| dollars would have been generated under the old or the existing model so I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| you know I don't know how the board might want to approach that dynamic if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| if they totally defer to the board on this if the board were to say you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| we we would oppose any type of funding structure that would result in less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| funding not just less funding but less funding than what the districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| otherwise would have received under the BEP formula you know that's that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| something potentially to consider but yeah this is on both miss Owens copy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4851)|
| 1:21:06| the other copy it was just some language clarifications for me on both of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| there and I am terrible with acronyms and I'm thinking if I don't know what an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| acronym means I can pretty much probably assure you our legislators don't either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| but TANF what is that okay and maybe I literally am the worst at acronyms but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4878)|
| 1:21:28| think anytime we use an acronym we've got to put in parentheses what it is so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| that would be my other thing and then this is my other thing is on support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| increased funding and on both of these we bullet point where we want it to be I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| really think we need to put what it's currently funded at because I think when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| we have these conversations you know if it's you know like a school nurse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| position we're saying we wanted one nurse for 750 students well if it's 775| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4911)|
| 1:21:58| students currently then that's not big a difference we all know that it's a huge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| difference so I think I think for all those bullet points where we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| have a tied better ratio I think if we could put what our current funding is I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4926)|
| 1:22:12| think that would be very helpful in our conversations because it would just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| already be there for us to talk about but I think too it's kind of shocking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| when you see what it currently is compared to what it should be so I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| totally fine with really what the topics are I think that would just help kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| highlight some of these problems that we know exist but really bring them to the forefront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| and that would be kind of the only thing I would ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| Ms. Horn. Thank you Madam Chair. So a couple of things one I agree with Ms. Owen I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4957)|
| 1:22:45| hold a harmless language needs definitely to change I think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| just absolutely no question I totally agree with the sentiment but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| that that language is not going to win us any points so I think that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| definitely needs to change and Ron do we expect the new funding model to be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4976)|
| 1:23:03| place for the next fiscal year do we know that for sure or is that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| expectation? That's the speculation I would I would phrase it that way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| based on what we heard from the state officials a couple weeks ago that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| intent. One thing I think we can absolutely say that BEP is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=4996)|
| 1:23:21| dead at some point whether it's this year or next they're just not going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| to that. One thing too I might add that what the point that Ms. Babb made which I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| think is a good point where that sometimes gets a little tricky is the BEP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| formula may say we get funded I'm making this up we get we get funded one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5015)|
| 1:23:42| position for every pick a category. It's like 2,000 nurses. Yeah right but there's this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5022)|
| 1:23:50| there's this fiscal capacity index that really throws that askew because the BEP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5030)|
| 1:23:57| formula in the formula itself it may say you're funded on one for every 500 kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5037)|
| 1:24:02| when you apply that ratio that factor though when you run those numbers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5042)|
| 1:24:08| then the local contribution comes into play that's required you're instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5048)|
| 1:24:14| being funded one for 500 in real dollars you're actually funded one for like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5054)|
| 1:24:18| maybe seven or eight hundred right because the real dollars are totally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5058)|
| 1:24:23| different than what the formula says. So the formula is maybe you may get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| position based on okay for every 500 kids I get a position but then that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| position is reduced in real dollars based on the fiscal capacity. Okay so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| agree with Ms. Babb that it would be nice to see those because I know like on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5076)|
| 1:24:40| last year's copy I went back in and wrote it in so that I have it there so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| if we were going to put it on there could it could it say for Knox County so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| that it's specific to us? Yeah we could we could clarify in some ways we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| say something like per the per the per the formula and then in real equals in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| real dollars. Or you could even do an asterisk at the bottom and I in just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| couple of formatting things you know the the version that we used last year had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5104)|
| 1:25:10| those things that we need additional funding like school nurses guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5110)|
| 1:25:16| counselors they were just in bold I think it would be nice to maybe see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| those in bold I just think it's we need that's those numbers are so important I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| think that if we can just make it look a little cleaner on what those numbers are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5123)|
| 1:25:28| I think it would be how is that do you agree with that? There's a yellow folder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| that you have a copy there that may be helpful. Okay yeah yeah I think just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5132)|
| 1:25:40| so Ms. Owen I had a question is yours so what you have is it different than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5140)|
| 1:25:46| the one that looks like this for the that the district has put out? Yes it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5146)|
| 1:25:51| in the yellow folder. Okay but what about the I mean is it is there something in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5151)|
| 1:25:55| particular I know I see one difference I see yours includes the school vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5155)|
| 1:25:59| is there is it pretty much the same? It's basically the same and follows the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5159)|
| 1:26:05| format that we have followed several years and has the same language. I went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5165)|
| 1:26:11| back to ensure that all of those things that we have discussed over several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| years were worded the way we intended them to be worded. Okay. And there for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5175)|

| 1:26:39| Great thank you. Thank you so much for putting that together that's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| helpful and then I just had one other content question under the one the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| district has prepared it says under increased funding it says students with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5208)|
| 1:26:54| disabilities and English language learners is there a way that we can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| that more specific or should it be more specific maybe it shouldn't but it's on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5218)|
| 1:27:06| on the district copy under supports increased funding for so it's there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5226)|
| 1:27:13| school nurses guidance counselors social workers and then it just says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5233)|
| 1:27:18| students with disabilities and English language learners I mean there may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| be a way to make it more specific it just seems kind of like the others are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5241)|
| 1:27:29| so specific but then that one just kind of seems like it's out there so is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| a way to make that more specific and what you know what would that be maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| we can ask Ron to look at that and come back to us if there's something on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| one yeah like what do we need it like what's it for exactly so and just just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5263)|
| 1:27:49| to be clear again this is just something I had asked the superintendent if he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| could share with us just now because they're the ones that have to oh yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| it's very sure that we're in compliance absolutely and I appreciate the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5277)|
| 1:28:01| that you guys have done on this absolutely it's really helpful so those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| were that that's really that was really the biggest question that I had was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| really just you know can that be more specific so thank you so much for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| work that went into that Mr. Watson thank you madam chair I just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| reiterate what we've already mentioned about the whole harmless I was in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| legislative workshop at the TSBA convention and legislators in that room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5300)|
| 1:28:24| said hey that that's not going to fly so I think we definitely need to move away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5304)|
| 1:28:29| from that language again I think the intent is right I agree with what miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| Babb said and I think using like you said asterisk and in real dollars I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5314)|
| 1:28:39| think is a is a way to get at that I want something that's not been mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| is in the in Bob's version of it in the improved funding I think it actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5323)|
| 1:28:49| helps the the language around based on the recommendations of BP National| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5329)|
| 1:28:56| Association nurses kind of giving a little bit of credence to hey here's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| some entities that say this is what we need to kind of shoot for I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5340)|
| 1:29:05| missing in miss Owens version so I think adding that would be helpful in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5345)|
| 1:29:10| it I do agree with molding it and I also think there's a couple places maybe in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5350)|
| 1:29:16| Bob's version that we could pull out some sub bullets to make it easier to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5356)|
| 1:29:21| find and to read but I actually like the formatting of the district's version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5361)|
| 1:29:28| because I like that it's branded to Knox County schools it doesn't seem like it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| just it the the version that we've been using for a while seems like it could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5372)|
| 1:29:38| come from any district even though I know it says Knox County at the top I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| like that it's kind of branded to Knox County it does get longer that way I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5381)|
| 1:29:47| mean it's now a front and back instead of just a front but I do like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5387)|
| 1:29:52| branding and also notice that the one thing that was missing is miss Warren| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5392)|
| 1:29:57| pointed out was school vouchers and I do think we should add that in especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| because I think one of the big concerns that I've heard and it was mentioned at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| TSBA from a lot of different people is that potentially this rework of the BEP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5403)|
| 1:30:09| is a is a way to get to a place where it makes vouchers easier so I think if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5409)|
| 1:30:16| there's any year to include that again the board would have to approve it that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| we want to take a strong stance against that this would be a year as they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5420)|
| 1:30:25| looking at the BEP formula so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| miss Ellen thank you madam chair looking at the issue of branding I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5429)|
| 1:30:35| consider this an official document and an official document from us should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| have the seal on it rather than the logo so I think if we're going to if we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5440)|
| 1:30:45| going to follow those those rules then we would want to have an official seal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5445)|
| 1:30:56| you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5456)|
| 1:31:06| miss them miss Henderson do you want to speak to your addition yes thank you miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5466)|
| 1:31:13| bad so I did have one addition I do like what the district put together so thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| you so much for your work on that and I did have one addition to the district's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5477)|
| 1:31:23| version is asking the state to fund the SRO program the state did pass a bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5483)|
| 1:31:32| which funds the SROs but Knox County already had their SRO program in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5492)|
| 1:31:39| therefore we pay for our SRO programs when other schools have been funded by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5499)|
| 1:31:44| the state and so I would just like to work with the state to see that funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| that way we can open up our funds to hopefully use that money for retaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5508)|
| 1:31:56| and for raises for our SROs I guess I guess you informed me about something I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5516)|
| 1:32:06| wasn't aware of so is that if we ask for this is it is it specific for just Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5526)|
| 1:32:12| County that so really this is just a Knox County issue that we need to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| about that sounds like yes something we would I would like to bring up with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| state since we already had our program implemented we're still paying for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| SROs where when they were the schools that have newer programs the state is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5544)|
| 1:32:30| funding those SROs so I think that across the board the state should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5550)|
| 1:32:35| funding the SROs superintendent mr. Brink Pearson correct me if I'm wrong I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5555)|
| 1:32:41| do think that was brought up in that meeting that we were into and from other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5561)|
| 1:32:46| districts asking wanting the state to fund those as well so that's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5566)|
| 1:32:52| going to be coming up from other districts as well mr. Watson thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5572)|
| 1:32:58| madam chair I just want to be clear miss Anderson because I know we've talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| about this a lot in the last year do you are you referring to SROs with KPD and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| KCSO or are you talking about SSOs I just wanna make sure I'm understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5586)|
| 1:33:12| yeah would it be the SSO okay are our employees are the ones that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5592)|
| 1:33:20| funding so the ones that we are funding so yes I apologize the reason I asked is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| because KCSO and KPD actually fund our SROs we don't fund them at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5604)|
| 1:33:29| internally yeah so you're talking about the SSOs that we employ that we employ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5609)|
| 1:33:34| okay yes okay and so because the other part of your piece was to put an SSO in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| each school mm-hmm which currently we have an SSO in each school so your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5619)|
| 1:33:44| issues really more around funding mm-hmm that is about increasing the funding is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5624)|
| 1:33:50| just equal right because currently Ron there's no funding in the BEP for SSOs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| SROs but you're saying there's a separate law that that's correct so if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5635)|
| 1:34:00| there's a separate law that we can take advantage of is this really a local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| issue we got to work through about how to take advantage of it if the every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| district really well well that's what I'm trying to clarify does the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| provide funding for any district to tap into for this and we just haven't taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5651)|
| 1:34:17| advantage okay so what's the law specifically do so in 2019 the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5657)|
| 1:34:23| passed a law that any school district that doesn't have that program doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| have it exactly exactly so I would just like to open up a conversation with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5668)|
| 1:34:35| so that way we can have a level playing field and it would open up funding for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| us to use that money elsewhere to retain to recruit I think it raises I think if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5679)|
| 1:34:47| we I think it's great to have the state fund more of what we're already doing I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5687)|
| 1:34:51| think to be able to speak about it easier it'd be great to know like what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5691)|
| 1:34:56| where does that funding come from since this is not the BEP like just some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| technical things around it yeah I mean your suggestion was pretty brief so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| think if if we want to add it to the legislative agenda you know just getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5704)|
| 1:35:09| some technical things around it would be great and they're again referring back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5709)|
| 1:35:16| to that meeting it sounds like that might be part of the push to get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| actually put into the BEP right the new formula so that might be where we yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5721)|
| 1:35:33| right so maybe we include it in the sorry my screen just went dark in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5733)|
| 1:35:42| improved funding section of this as an additional bullet just like nurses and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| all that but be real some people legislators are going to read that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| be like oh well people you already have access to that you're not taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| advantage of it so I think we got to be real clear about opening up to districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5753)|
| 1:35:57| who are already had an SSO program. Ms. Owen. Thank you Madam Chair I just want to clarify I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5757)|
| 1:36:04| believe the law that was passed in 2019 is a grant program when they started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5764)|
| 1:36:10| looking at that law the cost was huge for all counties and so it didn't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5770)|
| 1:36:17| very far it didn't get much past that yes it didn't get past the fiscal note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5777)|
| 1:36:22| and it's anyone who had school security at that time is not covered so if any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5782)|

| 1:38:14| with what we just did? I guess either someone brings a new document for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5894)|
| 1:38:23| consideration and makes a motion on that or we can just go item by item. I wonder if it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5903)|

| 1:39:34| for you to vote on. That's acceptable. Ms. Owen does that sound good? Okay. All right thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=5974)|

| 1:40:04| Watson or Ms. Babb sorry. Yeah I guess I just have a question about how this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6004)|
| 1:40:10| works since it's four LEAs that are together on this is it just assumed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6010)|
| 1:40:17| we're all going to do it is there ever a discussion between like the four school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| board chairs of these I mean that's where it I'm like how do we go up I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| and it's not like that I'm unhappy with them but it seems like it's just it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| seems like it should be a discussion between the four LEAs are they happy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6030)|
| 1:40:35| I don't know how you do that but I just this is obviously in place way before my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6035)|
| 1:40:40| time I just kind of trying to figure out the process on is it just automatic and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6040)|
| 1:40:46| we individually all vote on it but we don't all four groups talk about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| together so just if anybody's got any knowledge I would love that. I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6050)|
| 1:40:55| the way it's done and has been done in the past is that this is their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| organization and we may choose to be a part of it or choose not to be a part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6059)|
| 1:41:05| it so I don't think we've ever discussed it as that group of four as far as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| know so we can each each choose to sign on or not. And this is not talking in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6070)|
| 1:41:17| any way about the particular organization whether we think they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| good or not but say we we all thought they were terrible there's never anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| it doesn't seem like there's any ever discussion on whether people are happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6084)|
| 1:41:29| with their services or not which seems kind of peculiar when you're spending a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| pretty good money and these people are doing a very good job to us I guess I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6092)|
| 1:41:39| just questioning the process a little bit or really trying to understand our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| process on keeping them hired. Once again this is not a up or down on their work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6102)|
| 1:41:47| itself it's just it doesn't seem like we actually ever discuss as a whole because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6107)|
| 1:41:53| it's like we just have these I've never heard of a group where you just kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| never have a say on whether you keep hiring them or not. Well we do have a say we have a say whether we whether we are happy with them and then if we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6116)|
| 1:42:05| happy with them I think we need to express that to them. But it seems like I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| mean and maybe this is maybe me not understanding it seems like there's four school districts all hiring them together. It seems like at some point those four school districts should have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6129)|
| 1:42:19| conversation of are we hiring the right group and once again I'm making to do with yes or no on this particular group but because if we didn't like it then all of a sudden we're out. But really it's the four groups together that really need to be making that decision but that doesn't ever sound like those four groups ever talk to each other. I'm not sure how that could. I mean originally wasn't it the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6139)|
| 1:42:45| superintendent's that Mr. DuPorte have some insight. Sure I can I mean such a meeting could occur it have to be open to the public have to be noticed and that would be a could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6165)|
| 1:43:00| logistically have issues as well so but but but it could occur I mean it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6180)|
| 1:43:15| and the reason it's probably hasn't occurred since it was formed is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6195)|
| 1:43:26| that I mean there would be a lot of difficulty and maybe putting something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| like that together. Once again our lovely sunshine. I don't know who was first here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6210)|

| 1:43:41| idea I had a conversation and really this conversation stemmed from another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6221)|
| 1:43:46| board member conversation that I had with a board member from Rutherford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6226)|

| 1:44:04| you know do you large districts ever get together and just have conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| that are specific to large districts and I said no but I think that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| fantastic idea so what I think that we ought to do I think that maybe at TSBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6251)|
| 1:44:19| because that would be a time that we could notice it but maybe at TSBA we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6259)|
| 1:44:24| schedule a meeting that's not with Millsaps and Gowan that's just with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6264)|

| 1:44:34| other topics that are pertinent to large school districts because and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6274)|
| 1:44:41| also and we could as far as that goes we may want and I think TSBA would be very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6281)|
| 1:44:47| open to it because TSBA is currently trying to fill in the gaps with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6287)|
| 1:44:52| things that NSBA used to do and cube used to do so they're working on kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6292)|
| 1:44:59| initiatives like that anyway so this could be a place that we ask TSBA to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6299)|
| 1:45:04| facilitate a meeting with the large the five large school districts in addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6304)|
| 1:45:09| to our meeting with Millsaps Gowan that we can just talk about this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6309)|

| 1:45:33| our lobbying organization could be one of those conversations because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| if we're really never having that group and Rutherford to me is the perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6337)|

| 1:46:33| discussion on it and I don't think there's been a lot since then so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6393)|
| 1:46:40| the consensus at that time was to go ahead and continue with this group but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6400)|
| 1:46:47| there was that discussion and quite in depth about what services they provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6407)|
| 1:46:53| and why and could we find another group that would not anything reflective like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6413)|

| 1:47:10| want to but I think that was the last time was 2015 and several of us did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6430)|

| 1:49:14| whether they had any role played in them and that's good and at the time as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6554)|

| 1:50:23| or more members of this board so what if I mean every board member well then as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6623)|

| 1:50:34| notice yeah yeah I mean I mean okay and and as as miss horn was was stating I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6634)|
| 1:50:41| mean you all can talk individually to other board members from other counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| that's that's that's not a problem at all individually but if you want to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| a big group meeting with with other boards and including yourselves then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6649)|
| 1:50:53| yeah it would just need to be public notice but if it is you're able to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6653)|
| 1:50:57| that together this will be it if somebody wants to do it like spring of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6657)|

| 1:51:10| I think I think I was just trying to find something you left this bad to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6670)|
| 1:52:10| and class does have a set of bylaws that miss Coatney will send the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| members to to look at those prior to Wednesday's meeting mr. Watson I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6734)|
| 1:52:25| back up just a minute and ask a question on the legislative priorities are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6745)|
| 1:52:33| gonna vote on those collectively or if you disagree with one or two or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6753)|
| 1:52:40| you just vote no collectively would probably be best and I do think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6760)|
| 1:52:50| personally I think it's counterproductive when we are not all in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6770)|
| 1:52:54| agreement on them because you know when you take that to the you know your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6774)|
| 1:53:01| representatives they're they're gonna they're gonna pay that much change well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6781)|

| 1:53:10| thank you mr. Watson Thank You madam chair it's bad I really appreciate you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6790)|
| 1:53:18| bringing it up because something like that certainly shouldn't be a rubber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| stamp and I agree with miss horn I mean I we were all together meeting with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6801)|
| 1:53:25| in at TSBA and I think there's a lot of benefit to that type of meeting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6805)|
| 1:53:30| certainly extending that and being able to talk about more issues outside of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| know them being present I mean it's me it's a natural place to do it and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| already publicly noticed and it takes care of all those issues I will point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| out I didn't realize this until that meeting that they've not increased their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6821)|
| 1:53:45| fees since the agreement started so I don't know how long the agreements been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| in effect but I mean typically what you would see I think in agreements like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| this is an increase year over year so I don't know what's caused them or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| motivated them to do that I did notice that the particular letter that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6836)|
| 1:54:00| is actually addressed to dr. battle at Metro Nashville which I know there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| places for us to sign below I mean for miss Christie to sign but I'm wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6844)|
| 1:54:10| in the history of it did it originate within Metro Nashville is that why the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6850)|
| 1:54:13| letters addressed there or I can answer that yeah I believe it has to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6853)|
| 1:54:18| the bylaws and who is chair at this time and so it has passed it has passed from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6858)|
| 1:54:24| Nash but from Memphis to Nashville okay so it would be because that would be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6864)|
| 1:54:30| chair of the organization at this point yeah thank you and then also to miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6870)|

| 1:54:40| I'm sure there's ways you can do that and to add a component into whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6880)|
| 1:54:44| contract we have them have with them about providing metrics that speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6884)|

| 1:54:54| it and again I don't know all the mechanics of how to measure the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| effectiveness of lobbying but I'm sure people have come up with ways to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6897)|
| 1:55:00| so thank you madam chair I want to share my experience with class because I meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6900)|
| 1:55:10| with them every week throughout January until the session ends every week we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6910)|

| 1:55:33| that is coming up in session for the week to be sure that if we have concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6933)|
| 1:55:38| that they need to address with our legislators that they can address those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6938)|
| 1:55:42| so whatever is on on the calendar for the week they will go over any concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6942)|
| 1:55:49| that we have if there's something that hasn't been noticed or whatever and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6949)|
| 1:55:54| they can discuss it with those legislators the meetings that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6954)|
| 1:55:58| with us of course at TSBA to go over those things as well a couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6958)|

| 1:56:09| think I remember having this discussion every year a couple of years ago Ben| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6969)|
| 1:56:15| with TSBA put together a presentation for us that showed all of the lobbying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6975)|
| 1:56:21| organizations that our legislators are hearing from they have if you walk into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6981)|
| 1:56:29| a an education committee meeting you are going to see suits of lobbyists the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6989)|
| 1:56:36| will be full of lobbyists and those lobbyists are often organizations who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=6996)|
| 1:56:42| are in the business of taking funds from public schools there are not a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7002)|
| 1:56:50| of lobbyists or public schools Memphis has their own Nashville usually has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7010)|
| 1:56:58| person who goes that they're not a lobbyist and our large districts have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7018)|
| 1:57:04| Millsaps Gowan and we have our TSBA folks who go and that's all we have so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7024)|
| 1:57:12| for us to to have no one speaking on our behalf is very concerning I I'm very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7032)|
| 1:57:20| sure that we couldn't hire a single lobbyist for this amount the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7040)|
| 1:57:25| relationship that they have with other lobbyists is very good and what I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7045)|
| 1:57:31| seen is the relationship that they have with our legislators is also very good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| it's not it's not the kind of confrontational relationship I have with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7055)|
| 1:57:41| them they they get along very very well and share concerns with them in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7061)|
| 1:57:50| that it is heard let's say it that way my my experience has been that anytime I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7070)|
| 1:57:59| am in Nashville anytime I'm there for meetings both Robert and Elizabeth are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7079)|

| 1:58:11| talking to everyone and I've never ever been there that I haven't run into them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7091)|
| 1:58:16| there so the work that they are doing I think is very consistent and very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7096)|
| 1:58:22| necessary if we were going to look at any other firm I would feel very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7102)|
| 1:58:28| concerned to to stop that relationship right now as the legislative session is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7108)|
| 1:58:38| beginning I think that's something that would need to be considered at a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| different time. Thank you. Ms. Babb. Yeah I guess I would just like a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7122)|
| 1:58:50| more information from Ms. Henderson about about your not wanting to vote on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7130)|
| 1:58:56| is and I guess what I'm wondering is do you feel like we don't need a lobbyist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7136)|
| 1:59:01| do you think we not do not need to be part of class or do you think we need a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| different lobbyist and I guess that's where I'm just trying to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| where you're coming from. I would like to look at other opportunities I mean I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7146)|

| 1:59:15| living and so there are measurable outcomes on how a lobbyist you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7155)|
| 1:59:20| shows their goals and you know the last time that class came and did their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7160)|

| 1:59:33| that we did that came up in the legislature and here's how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7173)|
| 1:59:37| effectively helped you guys here were the outcomes that we affected with Bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7177)|

| 1:59:49| kind of measurable outcomes from that presentation and so that is what I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7189)|
| 1:59:54| looking for from a lobbying firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| Thank you Madam Chair. I see your point I maybe we need to maybe as Mr. Watson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7197)|
| 2:00:04| said we need to have a more specific request and information that's printed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7204)|

| 2:00:19| that is definitely a room for improvement but I think that part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7219)|
| 2:00:25| issue is that and then I think the other in that in that we do have a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7225)|
| 2:00:30| duplication when we're hearing from TSBA and them we're hearing some of the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7230)|

| 2:01:03| this conversation also at TSBA with somebody I think from one of the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7263)|
| 2:01:08| front of the other larger districts that literally there are like maybe one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7268)|
| 2:01:14| handful of people who are advocating for public education meanwhile I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7274)|
| 2:01:19| the number was well over 200 I'm not even sure that's I think it was over 200| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7279)|
| 2:01:25| of lobbyists who are lobbying lobbying really not for public education they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7285)|
| 2:01:30| really lobbying for things that are going to take money away from public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7290)|
| 2:01:34| education so just to have other voices both of them are public school parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7294)|
| 2:01:42| that always I think in the meeting that we have in Nashville with them at TSBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| that really always comes out in that meeting I think specifically they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7306)|
| 2:01:51| both public school parents so they're arguing what they're arguing for us they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7311)|
| 2:01:56| believe them I mean this is like this is what they this is what they you know they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7316)|
| 2:02:01| want for their own children so they're arguing from a point of view that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7321)|
| 2:02:06| think when and I'm not opposed to the RFP idea however when you said that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7326)|
| 2:02:11| thought about okay we could do an RFP but the fact that they argue as a parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7331)|
| 2:02:18| would on behalf of public education I think is helpful and then the other the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7338)|
| 2:02:25| only the other issue in thinking about if we wanted to go in a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7345)|
| 2:02:29| direction I I don't know that it would be responsible for us to not vote to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7349)|
| 2:02:35| prove this right now because we haven't had conversation with the other districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7355)|
| 2:02:39| and we are part of this organization so I'm not opposed to making a change but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7359)|
| 2:02:46| I'm not saying either way I'm just saying that kind of as a point of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7366)|
| 2:02:52| know what the right thing to do I don't think it's the right thing to do to not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7372)|
| 2:02:56| approve this without having any conversation with any of the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7376)|
| 2:02:59| districts so what I would like to see this board do I would like to see us go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7379)|
| 2:03:05| ahead and contact Tammy right now to ask her to set up something for us with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7385)|
| 2:03:11| the other four districts at TSBA and have the conversation and go from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7391)|
| 2:03:16| so for those reasons I will be voting to approve this contract and I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7396)|
| 2:03:21| appreciate that the folks who've questioned I think that's what we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7401)|
| 2:03:26| do but but for these reasons I'm going to be voting for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| Mr. McMillan. I was just going to comment on I think I really don't know how effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7410)|
| 2:03:41| they are but they usually measure lobbyists by how effective they are at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7421)|
| 2:03:50| getting certain legislation asked or defeated and you know if I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7430)|
| 2:04:01| that that you'll have enough votes to to keep them at least this time but I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7441)|
| 2:04:14| know people anybody that has been the representative here to the best of my knowledge has been impressed with their style and they can talk at the top but can they do the rest of it is my question you know I'm not saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7454)|
| 2:04:39| they're not committed you know but you could be real real committed but not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7479)|
| 2:04:48| very effective and that's you know if it were in sports or something that's maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7488)|
| 2:04:58| didn't win enough games at this prestigious institution so you know you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7498)|
| 2:05:05| get fired but I'm not saying I don't take it wrong I'm not saying they should be fired I'm just saying it's the world we live in and I also since you seem to be really familiar as you should be, I talk to them each time, Jennifer, who would you say is the most effective organization over there now as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7505)|
| 2:05:35| lobbying? Not necessarily in education. I think that would be hard to say because when we're looking at when we're looking at what our lobbyists are lobbying for to say that they are specifically having an outcome might not be might not be fair because when you look at a lobbyist for one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7535)|
| 2:06:01| organization lobbying for their organization you can say that but we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7561)|
| 2:06:08| similar groups lobbying for the same thing so let's say that I'm not trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7568)|
| 2:06:19| give you one but let's say that I had someone lobbying for Coke then then what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7579)|
| 2:06:26| their outcome was we could tell but when we have Millsaps Gallen and TSBA and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7586)|
| 2:06:32| sometimes TEA all lobbying for the same thing I think it's it's going to be hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7592)|
| 2:06:38| for us to say that this is the one group that made the difference I think we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7598)|
| 2:06:43| go back and look at outcomes and see exactly what we gained but I think we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7603)|
| 2:06:49| have to realize that it was a combination of efforts from Millsaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7609)|
| 2:06:55| Gallen and TSBA and whatever other public school interests were lobbying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7615)|
| 2:07:00| for that I don't think we can break it out to just them because I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| that's that's gonna be fair and I don't know who is the most effective lobbying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7624)|
| 2:07:10| organization. You've never heard them say anything about you know whether the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7630)|
| 2:07:18| anybody else that lobbies? There are a lot of very large organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7638)|
| 2:07:25| so I don't know who is the most effective. I thought you might have heard some mention of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7645)|
| 2:07:30| somewhere along the way you know but no I mean they I just think it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7650)|
| 2:07:45| difficult to measure you know just what you said you know if something passes or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7665)|
| 2:07:52| if it doesn't pass, if everybody's on the same side you know do they have the I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7672)|
| 2:07:59| guess what I'm saying is do they really no matter how much personally they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7679)|
| 2:08:05| committed do they have the firepower to make it happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7685)|
| 2:08:15| I don't think I can answer that but I think I can talk to our legislators and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7695)|
| 2:08:19| ask our legislators that question. I think that would be a more fair way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7699)|
| 2:08:24| look at it. Would that be useful? Yeah that would be useful. Why don't you survey our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7704)|
| 2:08:30| legislators and find out who they pay more attention to or how effective these people are. I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7710)|
| 2:08:37| Okay, thank you. Ms. Babb. And this is my last comment I'm making about this but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7717)|
| 2:08:44| think after hearing Ms. Henderson I think one of the things that's come up is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7724)|
| 2:08:48| we're hiring an organization who really is not accountable to really anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7728)|
| 2:08:52| because for these four groups that never talk to each other and so I do think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7732)|
| 2:08:58| have to come together as class and decide what do we want from our lobbyists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7738)|
| 2:09:02| what our expectations are and so I think there's a little bit of fault on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7742)|
| 2:09:06| part and that's why I will support them this year but I think there needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7746)|
| 2:09:10| further conversations on how to get more out of what we're paying for or and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7750)|
| 2:09:16| might be doing it I think we just need to we need to be asking for some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7756)|
| 2:09:19| reporting and I think that's the fault of our own because we just doesn't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7759)|
| 2:09:24| we almost need like a chair of class I think maybe we have unofficially do but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7764)|
| 2:09:28| it almost seems like there's got to be somebody that's sort of a charged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7768)|
| 2:09:33| person which as far as I can tell in class there's not it's just these four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7773)|
| 2:09:37| groups that sort of work independently but call themselves something so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7777)|
| 2:09:41| that we have to kind of take some ownership of this and to make it better and to get more out of our lobbyists too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7781)|
| 2:09:48| I don't know who was first. Ms. Bounds. No, I just want to commend this board because I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7788)|
| 2:09:57| think this conversation has been very beneficial and I like Susan's suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7797)|
| 2:10:02| and Virginia raising the question but I do think we have to keep in mind what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7802)|
| 2:10:07| Ms. Owens said and having been down there and testified before educational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| committees I felt very small and insignificant no matter what I had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7812)|
| 2:10:17| say as a public school teacher when I saw all the lobbyists lining the walls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7817)|
| 2:10:22| and all the relationships that they can build because they live down there they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7822)|
| 2:10:29| work down there and they party together and eat together and you also have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7829)|
| 2:10:35| consider how effective is a lobbyist I'm not sure Millsaps and Gowan have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7835)|
| 2:10:42| largest budget but some of these lobbyists and the organizations they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7842)|
| 2:10:47| represent have really large budgets to lobby with so anyway but I thank the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7847)|
| 2:10:53| board for their discussion and I think it has been very productive and we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7853)|
| 2:10:58| take some good steps forward from here before next year and this agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| comes back before the board. Ms. Henderson. Thank you Madam Chair I do agree I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7862)|
| 2:11:08| this has been a very healthy productive discussion and I do agree with what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7868)|
| 2:11:13| said I think there's accountability on both ends and it is hard when you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7873)|
| 2:11:18| there's four large districts that don't talk but what I would like to see is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7878)|
| 2:11:23| accountability on our end but accountability on their end as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| because I was very underwhelmed with that presentation of here's a list of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7885)|
| 2:11:29| bills but where were the steps that here's the steps we took to affect those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7889)|
| 2:11:35| bills or to create favorable you know measures for you guys with those bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7895)|
| 2:11:43| so I think it's on both ends both sides for sure. So any more discussion on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7903)|
| 2:11:51| item? Last one and discussion and possible action on superintendent search| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7911)|
| 2:11:59| and Satterfield's not here tonight so Ms. Bounds or Ms. Henderson. Yes I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7919)|
| 2:12:07| going to take the lead on this so our committee met right before the holidays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7927)|
| 2:12:11| we met on December 17th and we had an amazing meeting I thought it was very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7931)|
| 2:12:16| productive and it was a great meeting with our committee some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7936)|
| 2:12:20| that came out of that were the superintendent job duties I know that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7940)|
| 2:12:25| have a separate document for that but looking more into it a lot of the boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7945)|
| 2:12:31| have those duties within the policies which we do it is in section C so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7951)|
| 2:12:37| section C 120 that runs through C 125 have to do with the duties of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7957)|
| 2:12:44| superintendent and so we thought maybe we could discuss those at the January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7964)|
| 2:12:51| 19th policy review meeting and that way it was just more cohesive since they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7971)|
| 2:12:56| already documented in those policies. Mr. Dupler does that sound correct to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7976)|
| 2:13:02| that we would discuss those at the policy review meeting? Yes yes thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7982)|
| 2:13:09| Mr. Ms. Henderson yes absolutely you can you can discuss I mean the policies at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7989)|
| 2:13:15| policy review if you wanted to tweak them at that point yeah or or the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=7995)|
| 2:13:20| could could discuss them as part of part of the overall superintendent search as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8000)|
| 2:13:25| well I mean so yeah it's totally up to the board on how you all want to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8005)|
| 2:13:31| Okay so we can move those to the policy review which I believe is January 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8011)|
| 2:13:36| January 19th yeah that way if anyone wants to amend any of those policies we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8016)|
| 2:13:40| have time to look at those we can discuss that at that time that sounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8020)|
| 2:13:43| good with the board. Another thing we discussed was the salary which is a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8023)|
| 2:13:49| you know part of this and our committee discussed other similar school districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8029)|
| 2:13:54| in Tennessee the same size and we looked at their salaries and so it was our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8034)|
| 2:14:00| committee's recommendation to start salary negotiations at two hundred and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8040)|
| 2:14:05| fifty thousand dollars we felt like that was a competitive salary along with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8045)|
| 2:14:09| other districts of our size. Anybody had anything to say about that? We did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8049)|
| 2:14:17| discuss several different ways of approaching this and we decided as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8057)|
| 2:14:22| group against a salary range that it would be more effective and better to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8062)|
| 2:14:28| start as we can always depending on our candidates and their qualifications go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8068)|
| 2:14:34| up if we need to but that we didn't want to overstate it so and then we also I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8074)|
| 2:14:42| think I made the point of because there are a lot several of the larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8082)|
| 2:14:46| districts have larger salaries but their teachers also make considerably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8086)|
| 2:14:51| more and we talked about that and just realizing where our teacher pay is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8091)|
| 2:14:58| across the state and not creating discouragement amongst the rest of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8098)|
| 2:15:06| staff of Knox County by overpaying our top official so anyway yeah that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8106)|
| 2:15:13| good point we didn't want to be mindful of the salaries that our staff just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8113)|
| 2:15:17| across the board are making. Mr. Watson. Thank you Madam Chair. Ms. Henderson just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8117)|
| 2:15:24| to clarify the two hundred fifty thousand dollars that's being recommended that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8124)|
| 2:15:27| does not include benefits correct? That's correct. Yes. Ms. Babb. Did y'all discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8127)|
| 2:15:35| anything about moving expenses if it's someone from away? I thought that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8135)|
| 2:15:41| something Tammy had brought up that we might want to. Yeah we did talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8141)|
| 2:15:45| moving expenses. I think it's in the in addition to go ahead Mr. Dupley you may recall better than I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8145)|
| 2:15:52| That was before Christmas. Yeah it was it was. Thank you Ms. Henderson. Thank you Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8152)|
| 2:15:57| That was discussed I mean it is in the TSBA sample contract but but what was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8157)|
| 2:16:04| discussed at the committee meeting was the board can deal with that as it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8164)|
| 2:16:09| up I mean obviously depends upon what which which candidate you all decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8169)|
| 2:16:13| upon if the candidates coming from a great distance then then that certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8173)|
| 2:16:17| should be a consideration. Moving along another thing that we discussed at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8177)|
| 2:16:27| committee meeting was you know after comparing the superintendent contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8187)|
| 2:16:32| that we currently have to TSBA's template contract they're very similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8192)|
| 2:16:36| but our committee's recommending that we add a medical examination clause and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8196)|
| 2:16:40| criminal background clause to our current contract and I know Mr. Dupler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8200)|
| 2:16:45| was working on that contract I believe is this the one so everyone should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8205)|
| 2:16:52| a copy yeah yeah of that sample contract. And I can I can add to that if you'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8212)|
| 2:16:59| like. Yes that would be great. Thank you. Thank you. So yes as Ms. Henderson said I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8219)|
| 2:17:05| strongly recommended adding the criminal background check obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8225)|
| 2:17:09| since the last superintendent search the Tennessee codes become much more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8229)|
| 2:17:14| stronger when it comes to criminal background checks in in public schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8234)|
| 2:17:18| so add that section that's number 10 on on the on the form contract page 3 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8238)|
| 2:17:25| then the other one I felt like this was more optional but I mean but but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8245)|
| 2:17:30| committee felt like this was this was a good add and that's and that's number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8250)|
| 2:17:34| 13 medical examination at page 5 and and as you can see there it does add there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8254)|
| 2:17:41| was and in in the prior contract with Mr. Thomas there was a section on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8261)|
| 2:17:47| just a little bit talking about where where it talks about the determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8267)|
| 2:17:53| I believe it was 10f I think I referred to yeah and I need to I need to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8273)|
| 2:17:59| that site so that's that's 11f now the numbering changed but in any event 11f| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8279)|
| 2:18:07| talks about mental or physical illness or incapacity so really if you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8287)|
| 2:18:14| to have that it would be a good idea to have the medical examination portion as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8294)|
| 2:18:19| well and that's something that's that complies with state and federal law I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8299)|
| 2:18:23| know Human Resources uses that as well so yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8303)|
| 2:18:29| this one thank you madam chair my question on the medical examination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8309)|
| 2:18:33| would that those that information be that would not be open to public records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8313)|
| 2:18:40| or anything of that nature that would be private information I would assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8320)|
| 2:18:44| that's correct okay thank you miss Pam and I'm just wondering because it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8324)|
| 2:18:51| it seems like we required this I know I went for something you have to a drug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8331)|
| 2:18:55| test it seems like that should be part of this background check I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8335)|
| 2:18:59| if that would go under the medical examination part but to me if we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| requiring it of our teachers I personally think that should be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8343)|
| 2:19:07| requirement that that would be that would be separate I mean the medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8347)|
| 2:19:14| examination would just be for fitness for duty is you know what is what it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8354)|
| 2:19:19| called HR world so I mean I mean that's what it would be but yeah a drug test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8359)|
| 2:19:24| would be separate and and we would have to put that a separate clause in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8364)|
| 2:19:38| mr. Watson Thank You madam chair miss bad I completely agree with that when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8378)|
| 2:19:44| are we going to be asked to approve this contract I know we'll have to I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8384)|
| 2:19:49| assuming that when we have a superintendent we want to hire we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8389)|
| 2:19:53| going to approve it then but we have to have some kind of draft that that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8393)|
| 2:19:56| would see so we're going to be asked to approve this tomorrow or Wednesday I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8396)|
| 2:20:00| mean miss Henderson okay thanks thanks madam chair that was not the intent okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8400)|
| 2:20:09| this was this is what I would call a beefed up draft sure after after all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8409)|
| 2:20:16| information has been gathered thus far you know this this would be a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8416)|
| 2:20:21| contract in my opinion to use once you get that final candidate but there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8421)|
| 2:20:26| going to be tweaks and things so so this would just be a template used and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8426)|
| 2:20:30| the board once once it has its candidate right you all can hash out if you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8430)|
| 2:20:36| to tweak this or tweak that I mean you know this is and I think TSBA agrees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8436)|
| 2:20:41| obviously because I mean there's was fairly similar to this one that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8441)|
| 2:20:46| this would be a good template to use right so right now it's just it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8446)|
| 2:20:49| a working draft that would be presented to potential candidates as here's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8449)|
| 2:20:53| draft of what our contract correct like correct correct and there would I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8453)|
| 2:20:56| what what's happened in the past is there's been some negotiation once you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8456)|
| 2:21:00| all settle on a candidate so I mean after that negotiation is when more of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8460)|
| 2:21:05| final draft would then come before the board. Thank you. Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8465)|
| 2:21:15| I can't remember my question. What was my question? Oh I think I know what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8475)|
| 2:21:22| So the the medical examination part did you say I think you said this miss but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8482)|
| 2:21:27| miss Henderson that that was part of TSBA's contract that they sent is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8487)|
| 2:21:35| okay okay all right I just I was just wondering if this is standard that kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8495)|
| 2:21:39| of thing. Right so what we did was take our current contract and then TSBA sample| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8499)|
| 2:21:44| contract and saw kind of what we were missing and then it was our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8504)|
| 2:21:48| recommendations to add those back in. Mr. Watson. Thank you Madam Chair. Just out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8508)|
| 2:21:57| curiosity as you said that comparing those two documents I'm wondering if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8517)|
| 2:22:01| there's other things that even TSBA wouldn't have had in their draft that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8521)|
| 2:22:05| maybe other large districts have considered have we looked at any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8525)|
| 2:22:08| large district contracts like Metro Nashville's or Hamilton or anything like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8528)|
| 2:22:12| that. Mr. Duport. I mean our office largely developed the contract and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8532)|
| 2:22:28| know we I mean it does have some things that the TSBA contract doesn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8548)|
| 2:22:32| such as nepotism for instance. So you know we feel again we feel good about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8552)|
| 2:22:39| this contract but if there are any other aspects that you all might want to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8559)|
| 2:22:43| I mean yeah feel free to reach out to me and I'll be happy to talk about it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8563)|
| 2:22:47| then we can then we can bring it back to the board as a whole. Thank you. Yeah I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8567)|
| 2:22:51| think I mean for me if there was the only other sources I would go to is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8571)|
| 2:22:54| existing contracts of their large districts so is there I know those would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8574)|
| 2:22:58| be publicly available do we know the easiest way to access those? So Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8578)|
| 2:23:09| Coatney is offering to reach out to the districts. That'd be great. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8589)|
| 2:23:13| gonna say if you reach out to the districts because I reached out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8593)|
| 2:23:15| several districts regarding their job descriptions that surrounded us and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8595)|
| 2:23:20| were very forthcoming with giving me that information so I'm sure they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8600)|
| 2:23:24| with their contracts too. Thank you. The last thing we discussed was so we had an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8604)|
| 2:23:33| additional discussion our meeting about the superintendent valuation process and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8613)|
| 2:23:37| our committee has offered to continue working with TSBA to hammer out the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8617)|
| 2:23:42| evaluation framework if the board thinks that that's a good idea for us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8622)|
| 2:23:47| since the evaluation will be tied into the hiring process. And then you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8627)|
| 2:23:54| bring it I guess to the board for approval with a contract. Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8634)|
| 2:24:00| Mr. Watson. I don't know if you're looking for a kind of endorsement of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8640)|
| 2:24:06| that idea but I think it's a good idea for you all to continue on that. The one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8646)|
| 2:24:09| thing that I would ask for and I think I've been asking for it for a year as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8649)|
| 2:24:13| look at evaluation again is I really think it will benefit our superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8653)|
| 2:24:18| and our system that some component of our evaluation that's a 360. So just as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8658)|
| 2:24:24| you all work toward that if you can look at that aspect of it. And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8664)|
| 2:24:29| actually brought that up Dana knowing that you wanted that 360 so we intend to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8669)|
| 2:24:34| look at I mean to hopefully do that component as well. Yeah, we thought since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220103?start=8674)|
