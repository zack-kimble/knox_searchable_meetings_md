| 0:02:46| Yeah, I'd like to have three items removed from the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| It's R10-8-403, R10-8-912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=170)|
| 0:02:58| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=178)|

| 0:03:00| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=180)|
| 0:03:06| R10-8-403 and what's the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| R10-8-912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| R10-8-909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| Ms. Barbara Cook would like to speak or address these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| I would like to have 101 pulled off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| I would like to have that read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=209)|
| 0:03:35| I'm looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| Do you have another one, Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| I'm looking for the number for the Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| I can't find it right off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| but I'd like it to be pulled and put after zoning if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=229)|
| 0:04:05| Do you have a number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| I'm still looking for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| R-10-8-801, capital improvement plan relative to the school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=256)|
| 0:04:24| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| All of the resolutions honoring outgoing commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| elected officials who are present today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| I'd like to see those pulled so that we might properly recognize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=271)|
| 0:04:47| I'm not seeing him yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=287)|
| 0:05:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| Sorry, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| Yes, under public forum I have two items I just want to basically announce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| I just want to bring up the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=318)|
| 0:05:27| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| Why don't you go ahead and get everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| This is actually a request for a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| It's R-10-8-913 concerning the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| If the other co-sponsors of this would agree, I would like to have that deferred until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| If you'd like more of an explanation, I can give it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| But if not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| I have no problem with deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| No objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| Did you have something again, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| I do have an announcement to make at the appropriate time if you'll give me a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| It's your pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| I didn't know if Commissioner Hammond's polling of the resolutions for the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| if he pulled off one or two, the one for the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| All elected officials who are here as well as commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| We add everything to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| Defer of those to be deferred and withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| Everything needs to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| Before you vote, Commissioner, if I could, you have an item on your agenda, R-10-8701 relative to the purchase of an Asheville highway property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=403)|
| 0:06:54| We have not received any information as to whether or not there has actually been a negotiated deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| We don't have a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| We don't have a deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| So that is being vetted by Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| That is going to have to be continued or, in the alternative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| an update is going to have to be provided to the commission as to the status of that purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| And then you have two other resolutions that are requiring you to actually select some dates for action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| That's R-10-8906, which is relative to the appointment of a state senator district seat being abandoned by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=438)|
| 0:07:27| or I should say being surrendered by, Commissioner, or rather Mayor-Elect Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| And then R-10-911, likewise, requires you to select some dates for action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=451)|
| 0:07:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| Do you have something else, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| I didn't know if I was going to need it after the law director had his say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| Well, I guess in terms of just a point of clarification from the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| are you saying that we're going to hear those items because most of them weren't on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=479)|
| 0:08:07| So I didn't know where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| Well, my concern is that they seem innocuous on their face, but rather than, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| oftentimes they're just announced and then they're unanimously passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| but they actually require you to select some dates as a body politic before you can actually enact them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| And the land purchase, again, that either someone from Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| has to explain to you what the status is or the alternatives need to be continued another month because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=508)|

| 0:18:07| And he's very much looking forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| We're pleased to have him on the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| And I just introduce to you Kelly Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| I look forward to working for you and working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| Yes, I was just going to, with regards to recognizing the commissioners, when we get to that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1109)|
| 0:18:36| if each commissioner would like to recognize the person from their district who is leaving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| and, of course, any elected officials, the chair and vice chair, if you would recognize them at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| That was all I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| If no one has any objections, that's the format that we will use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| I'd like to take this opportunity to make a general announcement to all of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| and my colleagues here at County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| Coming up is Power It Down Day, and that's on August the 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| And what I would like for you to do, a lot of us don't work in the city-county buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| but I would like for each commissioner here to encourage their constituent businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| and their district to participate in the Power It Down Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| Power It Down Day is where individuals on Friday, the 27th of August, will turn their computers off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1168)|
| 0:19:35| their printers off, their peripheral devices off in their offices for that particular weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| It is estimated that it will save us somewhere in the neighborhood of 55 kilowatts per hour per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| Now, how do we know how much power we're going to save?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| What we need to do, and I'll ask you to do this, and privacy is protected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1191)|
| 0:19:57| but I would hope that we would have our people who are participating register,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| and you can register at www.poweritdown.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1201)|
| 0:20:08| And in so doing, that will give an estimate of how much energy that we have saved over this Power It Down weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1208)|
| 0:20:15| In addition, we have a little bonus that goes with the Power It Down weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| where Citrix, Intel, HP, and GTSI are going to make contributions to the Wounded Warrior Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1220)|
| 0:20:30| because of this Power It Down activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| So I just wanted to make sure that everybody in my commission colleagues here would kind of talk it up in your district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1233)|
| 0:20:40| and get our community to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| I think it would be a good thing for us and for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| Let's get as many people registered as we can and see how we do in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| Once again, August the 27th, leave work and power it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| On the same note, I had two general announcements that I just want to make for the people here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| and the people watching on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| On Thursday, September 2nd, one day after the new administration takes over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| we're going to hold a commissioners' night out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| It's going to be at the Hall Senior Citizens Building from 530 to 730,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| and all the department heads will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| Myself, Commissioner Wright will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| He has the other half of the Hall's community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| and our at-large commissioners, Commissioner Shouse and Hammond, have agreed to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| along with our new mayor-elect, Burchett, and our department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| Also, any office holders that are out there, if they'd like to come, they're welcome to come also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| But to bring any concerns that you have about Knox County, we're trying to bring government to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| So that's going to be on Thursday, September 2nd, from 530 to 7 at the Hall Senior Citizens Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1306)|
| 0:21:53| The second thing I want to talk about was we have a BZA appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| and I've talked with this to the law director about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| that we'll have a 7th District BZA appointment for the month of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| So we'll also be holding a public forum on that in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| Anybody that has resumes, if they would like to present those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| and we'll take a list from that and bring that at the September meeting for a recommendation for the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| Commissioner Lamb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Yeah, I just wanted to comment on Power It Down Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| But I appreciate you mentioning that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| I plan on participating, but that's power down all non-essential items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| Keep your burglar alarms on and your outdoor lights on because bad guys watch TV too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1354)|
| 0:22:42| Could we have public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| Our first person that wants to speak will be Ray Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1364)|
| 0:22:51| Where is he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| Ray Jenkins, 9114 Brown Low Newman Lane in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| Mr. Chairman, I understand during early voting you had the occasion to meet my wife at the polling place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1383)|
| 0:23:11| I trust that you, like everyone else who meets her, found her much more agreeable and pleasant than most people find me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1391)|
| 0:23:19| So I'm glad you got a chance to meet her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| I'd like just to say just a few words in what some would consider to be a rare bipartisan moment for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1403)|
| 0:23:32| Public service is not easy, and I want to thank every member of the commission for their service, Republican, Democrat alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1412)|
| 0:23:42| We don't always see eye to eye, but I've always respected your willingness to serve and the manner in which you've served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1422)|
| 0:23:50| I also wanted to thank Mayor Mike Ragsdale and Trustee Fred Sisk for their service over the years to our community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1430)|
| 0:23:59| Briefly, if I could, as Chairman of the Republican Party, I wanted to address a few of the outgoing commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1439)|
| 0:24:07| Commissioner Ivan Harmon, I wanted to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| You're wrapping up a term on the county commission to go along with the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| Thank you for your leadership and your steadfastness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| and good luck to you in any future endeavors that I think we all know that you may avail yourself of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1459)|
| 0:24:27| Commissioner Lutho, thank you for your willingness to step into leadership position when Commissioner Strickland had his health problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1467)|
| 0:24:38| We appreciate very much your leadership and your steady hand during those times and throughout your time on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1478)|
| 0:24:48| Commissioner Lambert, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| I think that it's fair to say that the commission meetings are going to be somewhat less exciting without you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1491)|
| 0:25:01| but we do appreciate your willingness to step forward and to represent your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1501)|
| 0:25:08| Commissioner Carringer, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| As a member of the fledgling Shannondale Mafia, a fellow member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| I appreciate very much your willingness to step forward and to serve the folks of the 7th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| and we hope we haven't seen the last of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| I want to skip the 8th District for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| Commissioner Pinkston, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| You have been a strong and steady voice for fiscal responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1528)|
| 0:25:36| The voters and the people, the taxpayers of Knox County, owe you a great deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| and I appreciate very much your willingness to take a strong stand on those issues on our behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1541)|
| 0:25:48| I skipped over the 8th District because that's my district, and Commissioner Armstrong is my commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1548)|
| 0:25:56| I have gotten to know Bud Armstrong personally over the last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1556)|
| 0:26:02| and I can tell you that there's no finer person in this building right now than Bud Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| and I want to thank you very much for the stands that you've taken for the people of the 8th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| and also for the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| I think it's fair to say that those of you who are left behind as commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1576)|
| 0:26:23| your jobs just got more difficult because these fine folks are not going to be around to help you out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1583)|
| 0:26:30| to provide counsel to you, and I know that Knox County is going to be poor for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| So thank you all very much for your willingness to be public servants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| Chuck Bowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1605)|
| 0:26:54| Chuck Bowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| Brian Moneyhun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1617)|
| 0:27:09| Thank you, Brian Moneyhun, 5512 Dogwood Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1629)|
| 0:27:16| Thank you, members of the commission, for your hard work and your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| I have now in my possession an inkling as to the process involved at you all being there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1642)|
| 0:27:30| where you all are sitting now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| Now, not all of you will be sitting here next month, that's to be sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| but all of you that have been and have been part of the process, I applaud you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1656)|
| 0:27:44| It takes a lot more than I ever thought to get out there and do street-level retail politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1664)|
| 0:27:52| And let me tell you, it was an eye-opening, just a whole experience for the past seven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1672)|
| 0:28:00| And I have been treated with much kindness, and I've had a lot of suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1680)|
| 0:28:07| and maybe had I followed them, I might have a job next month, but, you know, I chose my own way about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| But thank you for the kindness shown and the respect shown to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1694)|
| 0:28:21| And I'm just telling you, no one really that hasn't gone through the process has any idea what you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1701)|
| 0:28:30| the phone calls alone that you all receive at any time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| And I would recommend that you all resolve to fix everything before this next class comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1718)|
| 0:28:45| And if that doesn't get done and there are still some problems, there may be some folks, independently minded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1725)|
| 0:28:52| maybe stand up and go through the process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| Thank you so very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| I have some other names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| I'm not sure if they want to go now or after at our next public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1743)|
| 0:29:10| Conley Underwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1750)|

| 0:29:29| And Jana Preston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| Are any of them here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1774)|
| 0:29:41| Joe Bryson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1781)|

| 0:30:17| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| Commissioner Pinkston, you want it read into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| I would like to say something first before we read this into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| We're here today for this proclamation in naming this swimming pool in the name of Dr. Bruce Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1828)|
| 0:30:35| Dr. Walker was a great citizen of Knox County in his last few years of his life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| He worked hard to make county government more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| I can remember just like it was yesterday when the county started this efficiency panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| which Commissioner Hammond served on also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| and he came to our place of business and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| if you're really sincere about making government more efficient, I would like to serve on that panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| and if you're not, I don't want the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| Dr. Walker worked tirelessly to get this swimming pool with the PBA and everything, researched everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1865)|
| 0:31:15| And matter of fact, he is the one that came to me and told me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| you need to look and see if the government has any money to give us for this pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| I just want to tell you, this was a man of strong character and integrity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| and we're going to deeply miss him, all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| Clerk, you want to read this into the record now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| This is a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| dedicating and naming the swimming pool at the South Knoxville Senior Center in memory of Dr. Bruce Walker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| whereas Dr. Bruce Walker passed away in September 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| and whereas Dr. Walker was a graduate of Fulton High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and the University of Tennessee, Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| whereas Dr. Walker's professional accomplishments included service as the chief of staff of UT Hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| founding director of UT Women's Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| chairman of Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, UT Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1928)|
| 0:32:14| and whereas Dr. Walker served the good people of Knox County as both a beloved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| and respected physician and community leader, especially in the South Knoxville community for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| and whereas Dr. Walker's selfless service to the people of his community took myriad forms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1944)|
| 0:32:31| as evidenced by the fact that the Lakemore Home and Garden Club members planted a dogwood tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| at the South Knoxville Center in memory of Dr. Bruce Walker, a member of the community committee for the center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| and whereas Dr. Walker was instrumental in funding the property for the South Knoxville Senior Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| and was a strong voice and advocate for the senior citizens of South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| and whereas Dr. Walker also commendably served on the Knox County Government Efficiency Panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| and whereas it is indeed fitting to dedicate and name the swimming pool at the South Knoxville Senior Center in his honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1978)|
| 0:33:05| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the commission of Knox County as follows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| in recognition and honor of the public service and leadership of Dr. Bruce Walker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| the commission of Knox County hereby dedicates and names the swimming pool at the South Knoxville Senior Center in his memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=1993)|
| 0:33:21| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| as provided by the charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2005)|
| 0:33:32| As Commissioner Pinkston said, I served on the efficiency panel with Dr. Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| That was how I got to know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| And I often said to the folks there and say here publicly today, if you were to look up the word integrity in the dictionary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| you would probably find Dr. Bruce Walker's picture because that's the kind of individual he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| He loved this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| He loved good government, and that's what he wanted as a member of these efficiency panels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| was to have good government and to make sure that it was as efficient as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| So it's very fitting that we would remember him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| I know there are a lot of people who were his patients as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| that will also rejoice in the fact that he is being remembered this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| And this is something, as people see his name, I hope that everyone will remember the kind of individual he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| and the legacy that he leaves to those of us here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| Just one quick note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| I had the pleasure of going to church with Dr. Walker and his family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| so I know his faith extended on beyond the community as far as God is concerned too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| The senior center out there, when it first opened, I get the monthly bulletin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| and the first bulletin that came out, there might have been ten things listed on there for the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| And if you got last month's bulletin, you can't stick a pin on that calendar page anymore without an event going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2079)|
| 0:34:47| As a matter of fact, they've even opened up now two nights until seven o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| And part of that is due to the diligence that Dr. Walker put in to the establishment of this senior center out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2090)|
| 0:34:58| and continue to watch it grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| Dr. Walker was the consummate gentleman, absolute professional, and true community servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| And I've got a feeling he's listening to us right now, and I think this will bring a smile to his face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2111)|
| 0:35:17| He was absolutely relentless in the pursuit of that senior center and doing it the right way at the right location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2117)|
| 0:35:24| He was tireless in his efforts, and they were for all the good reasons and all the right reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| And I can tell you that Knox County is a much better place because of his many years of dedicated service in a wide variety of areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2130)|
| 0:35:38| I'd like to present this to his son, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| Steve's here to accept this in honor and maybe want to say something about his father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| But I would like for everyone to know that his family is here, but they just didn't feel like coming down to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| I would like to thank the Knox County Commission and Mayor Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| My family appreciates the recognition for my father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| As a husband and a life partner to our mother, as a father and a grandfather to us and our children, he is greatly missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2162)|
| 0:36:13| Daddy was the first to greet many thousands into this world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| His wisdom and his insights touched and guided many, many more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| He is memorialized by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| This recognition should be looked upon as an encouragement to everyone to get involved and make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2186)|
| 0:36:33| I'll leave you with a question I heard many times from Daddy growing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| What have you done constructive today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| I will translate that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| Each day you must work for your God, your family, your country, and your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2205)|
| 0:36:52| This work, these sacrifices are what reward you in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2212)|

| 0:40:27| We wish him the very best in all of his future endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| as provided by the charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2435)|
| 0:40:47| We've not voted, have we, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| Did we vote? Okay. We voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| Lost track there. His accomplishments are so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| It's sort of unique with Mike here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| First, I've known him for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| He was one of my commissioners back in the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| He served along with my father and served with distinction as a county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2470)|
| 0:41:16| And so at first I knew him not only as a friend but as a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| And then he left office and he was still my friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| We were friends through the Optimist Club in Knoxville and got to know him even better as time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| And then he decided to run for mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| And I was very supportive of him running for mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| And when it was my father decided to step down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| and I made the decision to run for commission outside of family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| he was one of the first people I called to let him know of my endeavors of running for commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| because that's how important I felt it was to give him a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| Not only is he a leader for the county, but he was a leader of the district I was running for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2514)|
| 0:42:02| So it was always an honor to be his friend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| but it was an honor to represent not only the 5th District, but it's sort of unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| along with Commissioners Brigg and Hammond and some of the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| to serve the 5th District, which included our mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| So it's sort of neat that one of your own constituents is the mayor of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2539)|
| 0:42:26| So it put a little pressure on us to keep up with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| But, Mayor, I appreciate all your service as a commissioner, as a mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| and we know that you're not done and continue to prosper in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2556)|
| 0:42:46| Mike, I too want to thank you for your friendship to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| We've been friends for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| We've been through a lot of ups and downs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| And we've had several conversations to lead this county forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| I want to thank you for your friendship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| Thank you for being there for me, and I hope I've been there for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| But I want you to enjoy yourself and continue to do good things that you want to do in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2590)|
| 0:43:17| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| Well, Commissioner Lutho, Commissioner Strickland, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| Let me say it has been a real pleasure to have served the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| for eight years as a county commissioner and eight more years as mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| And when we were listening to those accomplishments, I had one thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| I didn't do these things, but collectively, together, this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| the Board of Education, and most importantly our citizens, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| We made a difference, and that's what government is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| And I hope each of you take great pride in the accomplishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| the things that we've done together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| Well, as each of us know, this isn't an I or me deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| It's a we and us deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| As I leave Knox County government, I'm very thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| I had the opportunity to work with a truly outstanding staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| And when you look at the staff from top to bottom, it's very good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| I know each of you call on them frequently for help and guidance and meeting constituents' needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2651)|
| 0:44:18| and I think they've probably always been there for you whenever you need them and reach out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| To each of you individually, wish you the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| Those who are remaining, continue to make a difference in the lives of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| To those who are leaving, like me, I hope that we will also stay engaged in other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2668)|
| 0:44:34| because when you look at it, it's volunteers and involvement that truly make our community a much better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| I'm very touched by the recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| I am thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| And in concluding, I want to tell you how grateful I am to have had the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| to serve a great American community for the past eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2693)|

| 0:45:13| could we have a brief recess so that all commissioners could gather with the mayor for a quick picture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2713)|
| 0:45:18| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2718)|

| 0:48:12| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| The Knox County Commission hereby honors Thomas Tank Strickland for his years of service on the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2896)|
| 0:48:23| and his leadership and effective representation of the citizens of the First Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| We wish him the very best in all his future endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2908)|
| 0:48:34| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| Before I get started, there's two quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| One, I would like to thank Tank because one of those committees, the redistricting committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2918)|
| 0:48:45| he was instrumental in not taking my house out of the First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| So I thank you for allowing me to remain in the First District and the work you did in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| And the second piece is, you know, I've known Tank a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| Our friendship predates commission by decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| In fact, his mother is the first person not having the last name McKenzie to give me a whooping in the second grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2944)|
| 0:49:13| She was my second grade teacher at Fairgarden Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| She was pretty good, so I can imagine that probably got Tank pretty straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| You know, eight years is not a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| But when I look back and I think about what's happened, and I'm going to keep this to the First District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2965)|
| 0:49:31| because we all know and I'm sure the mayor is going to talk about his contributions to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| but I just look at the First District in terms of it being a district totally encumbered by the city map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2976)|
| 0:49:43| and the things that the county has done in the First District has been remarkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| You think about the Beck Center, the East Knox Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| You think about John T. O'Connor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| I'm sure I'm going to leave a lot of things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| Five Points, the Hardy Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| There's just been a whole lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| And the last of which during his tenure was today's event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| dedicating a beautiful park that will bear his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| So let's give Tank a round of applause for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3013)|
| 0:50:25| If you all would like to go to the Thomas Tank Strickland Park, it's on Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| where Holston Drive comes into Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| So I'm not going to take too long because we have a bunch of people going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| But, Tank, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| Thank you from the First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| Thank you as a friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| And I will continue to call you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| I think the mayor has something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| Well, I bragged on him enough early this morning, so I'll keep this short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| But Tank is a really good friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| He's a wonderful human being, and he cares greatly about his community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| And here's something that's really special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| As much as he loves and participates in the First District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| I really think he loves Knox County as a whole even more because during our visits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| he's always, not what can you do for my district, but what together can we do for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| I think he's going to leave a really strong legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| He's been an outstanding chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| And I look forward to us continuing our friendship in a much more relaxed role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| than what we've had in government for the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| But Tank's always been there for me, and I'll always appreciate him very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3082)|
| 0:51:33| I just want to say thank you to Mike and Sam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| and to publicly thank everyone that was involved in naming the park after me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| It was truly humbling, an honor, and I definitely appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| It has been a good run, eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| We've gone through trials and tribulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| We've argued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| We've fought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| We've had fun together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| It's been fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| You know, I think that's what it's all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| The final analysis is we come together for the good of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| and to do good for this county and to move it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| So I thank you for the honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| I thank you for you just being friends to me because I consider all of you friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| We haven't gotten along all the time, but in the end, I think we pulled it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3136)|
| 0:52:22| And I want to thank the staff and just everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3142)|

| 0:54:25| progressivism, commitment to education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3265)|
| 0:54:32| and his original insight into the many issues confronted by the Commission during his tenure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3272)|

| 0:55:04| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| Well, I just want to say in addition to all of those which are pretty much Mark's public and professional achievements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3306)|
| 0:55:15| he's also just one of the nicest, most decent, most honorable men that it's ever been my good fortune to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3315)|
| 0:55:24| And in our house he's known as Uncle Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| And I'm sorry that Aunt Becky couldn't be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3328)|

| 0:55:38| because I know that you mean a great deal to Levi as well as to the rest of the kids in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3338)|
| 0:55:46| And actually when I left home, Aiden was watching, believe it or not, the Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3346)|
| 0:55:53| And so I hope that she's still watching so that she can see you get this honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| because you're one of her favorite people too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| Mark has done probably more for progressive issues in Knox County than anyone has in a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3361)|
| 0:56:14| And you've set a very high bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| And you have extremely big shoes for me to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| And I appreciate all that you have done to educate me and prepare me for public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3380)|
| 0:56:27| And I'm still going to be calling on you pretty frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| So thanks, Mark, to all your service to the county and to the 2nd District, to our neighborhoods, and also to me and my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3392)|
| 0:56:42| We love you dearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3402)|
| 0:56:51| Mark is a very bright guy, in case you haven't picked up on that after the past four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3411)|
| 0:56:57| When he would come to my office and we'd discuss the budget, he had actually looked at it, every line, line by line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3417)|
| 0:57:03| and had magnificent questions to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| And I can remember one of the real treats was, and you haven't done this a lot lately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| but Becky would always send cookies down here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| And one heck of a cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| He is a guy who is in public service for the right reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| Doesn't need the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| Doesn't need the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| Has a core philosophy that's strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| And is passionate about trying to fulfill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| And he's not afraid to be on the losing end of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| And many times he's on the winning end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| But he wasn't willing to compromise his values for something that he didn't believe in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| But here's the thing that's left the most indelible impression on me about Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| And Commissioner Brewer has referred to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| Big brothers, big sisters, and his little brother, Levi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| I met Levi four years ago, and he's been with Mark at a whole lot of public events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| When you give your time so tirelessly and so unselfishly to help others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3473)|
| 0:57:59| I think that really defines who you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| And, Mark, thank you for your willingness to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| Thank you for your outstanding service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| And the University of Tennessee is fortunate to have you as a staff member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| and Knox County has been fortunate to have you as a county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| Best wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| Thank you, colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| I'm being short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| It was very kind of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| All those good words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| And Becky's punishing you by not sending you cookies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| You've been going too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| Let me just say that it was almost exactly four years ago today that Commissioner-elect Phil Ballard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3512)|
| 0:58:40| Commissioner-elect Greg Lambert, and I were all in a car headed to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| learn how to be a county commissioner session in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| Now, that sounds like the setup for a political comedic sketch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| but it's a real thing that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| And considering all that has happened in the interim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| all I can say is that lately it occurs to me what a long, strange trip it's been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3539)|
| 0:59:05| Clark, if you could read the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3545)|

| 1:02:05| of having 22 years of elected service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3725)|

| 1:02:42| And he's already said he's willing to help me get through the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| So we appreciate you, Ivan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3766)|

| 1:03:08| I remember they hosted a campaign event for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| And when you're in the middle of a campaign yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| and you reach out to host a campaign event for somebody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| that really speaks volumes about someone's friendship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| and what type of person they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3797)|

| 1:03:21| and he wants to continue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| And each of us wish him the very best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| After 16 years, the thought of another political race just made my stomach roll over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| But he loves it and enjoys it, and he's quite good at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| And as Commissioner Norman said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| the people in his district refer to him by his first name basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| and there's a reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| It's because he's their friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| Commissioner Harmon, congratulations on eight wonderful years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| as a member of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| I don't really want to have a lot to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| I just want to thank my colleagues that are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| especially those that are leaving with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| And, you know, we have had a great run in eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| We've made this county progress and moving in a progressive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| And I know the other 11 that's coming on in September is going to do as good a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| But, you know, remember, we have a lot of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| So if you need us, give us a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| Each district is going to need some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| I mean, you're going down to one per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| And I know me and Tony's talked, and Tony's dad was a great service of our community, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3853)|
| 1:04:18| And that's, I'm sure that's where he's got his back from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| And I just want Tony to wish him the well in the third district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| And he can always count on me if I can help him in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| If he's got a tree to cut, I'll try my best to get it cut for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=3870)|

| 1:06:46| and whereas Commissioner Luthold's experience and sensible guidance will be sorely missed by the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4006)|
| 1:06:52| and whereas Craig Luthold demonstrated the utmost professionalism, ability, and integrity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4012)|

| 1:07:00| garnering the respect and admiration of both his colleagues and the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| The commission of Knox County hereby honors Craig Luthold for his years of service on the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4028)|

| 1:07:19| We wish him the very best in all his future endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| I came to the University of Tennessee back in the 70s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4045)|
| 1:07:29| and I cannot remember a time when there has not been a Luthold on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| So today is kind of the end of an era, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| But when I first was elected to my first partial term, the first call I got was from Craig Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| And he said, welcome aboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| If there's anything that you need, call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| And I have called him on several occasions during those times, as we could, given the sunshine situation, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4066)|
| 1:07:54| And he was always helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| Not as much lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| Not as much lately, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| But also his father, Frank, was also just a great resource as a member of commission and then while we were on our efficiency panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4080)|
| 1:08:07| But I can tell you that we would not have Hardin Valley High School if it were not for Craig Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4087)|
| 1:08:12| He is tireless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| He was persistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| He was continuously after the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| And for those who watched those meetings and who were here, you know how tirelessly he fought for that high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| And not only the high school, but a lot of improvements in Knox County in the 5th District are a result of Craig Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| And one of the things that I've always admired about Craig is he stood by his principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| And he always voted the way that he felt that he should vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| And I told him before the meeting started, we'll miss him because we always look to him for parliamentary procedure to make sure that it's done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4115)|
| 1:08:41| Because we all know how important it is that it be done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| So, Craig, you will be missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| And we just appreciate your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| And I appreciate your friendship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| I'm just going to say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| I'm still trying to digest this image of Mark Harmon and Lumpy sitting together in a car on the road to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4132)|
| 1:09:00| But anyway, when I decided I wanted to run for office, I talked to some people here in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| And I didn't know anyone at all in the county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| But I wanted to talk to someone that really could give me a straightforward information that I needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4148)|
| 1:09:15| And they said call Craig Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| They said he knows more about the county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| His father is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| He grew up in it, literally, through his father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| And on top of that, he's a heck of a nice guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| I called Craig just as a complete cold call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| And I asked him, do you have time to speak to me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| And he said, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| And I think we talked a half an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| And I'll never forget that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| Likewise, his father has always been accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| I talked to him even last week about an issue that's coming up with the library board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| And it's just not going to be the same without Craig there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4183)|
| 1:09:48| He's always been a leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| He's the one that would vote his conscience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| And I'm going to miss him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| And I'm looking forward to being able to speak to him and talk to him when I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| and not be constrained by having to publish it in the paper that I want to call him on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| So the best of luck, and thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4202)|
| 1:10:09| Craig very articulately described our relationship earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| But when I was elected in 1990, the very first phone call I got was from Frank Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| And Frank had been a friend for a number of years into the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| We sat right over there in that corner together for eight years, and I leaned on him heavily for advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| And Craig has carried on that magnificent type of leadership that Frank gave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| A lot of positive things have happened in the 5th Commission District over the past 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4233)|
| 1:10:39| from schools to senior centers to parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| And it has, there's a reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| It's because for the past 30 years, the 5th Commission District has been represented by Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| And they're tireless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| If you paid them by the hour, divided their pay by what you earned an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| they're probably earning about 15 cents an hour for the amount of time they put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| Because it is nonstop, it's continuous, it's professional, it's positive, and it's about doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| Craig has been a really good friend of mine outside of commission, a good friend as a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4263)|
| 1:11:08| He is an advocate for good government and for spending money on the right things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| And I can tell you this, that commission really benefited from his leadership along with Chairman Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| I can't imagine having a better chair and vice chair than those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| So, Craig, as you go on about your business, I've got a feeling this isn't going to be the last time that we see you in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4283)|
| 1:11:29| Your dad said that about me when I stepped down from county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| He said, I don't think this is going to be the last time we see Mike Ragsdale in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| He's right, and I think I'm going to say the same thing about Frank's son, Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| He's a good man and a good friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| And Brenda has a wonderful husband, and those three boys have a great daddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4300)|
| 1:11:49| Thanks for the kind words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| Thanks for allowing me to be your vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4313)|
| 1:12:01| It's been a great honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| I didn't get into politics for anything but public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4323)|
| 1:12:09| That's why I worked for the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| That's why I ran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| That's why I coached basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| And I appreciate my dad being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4342)|
| 1:12:37| Craig, I just got back in, but I just want to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4357)|
| 1:12:53| The next resolution is 107.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| It's a resolution honoring Greg Lambert for his service as Knox County Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4380)|

| 1:13:08| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| We're asked, Greg Lambert is stepping down as Knox County Commissioner for the 6th Commission District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| after one term of distinguished service, electing not to seek re-election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| And we're asked Commissioner Lambert is a proud third-generation Powell resident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4405)|
| 1:13:30| a graduate of Powell High School, and attended classes at Rhone State Community College| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| and the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| Whereas an entrepreneur, Commissioner Lambert has owned a limousine service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| was a part owner of a very successful paging and cellular phone dealership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| and currently owns Advantage Auto Sales, a continuation of the family car dealership, Lambert Motors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4425)|
| 1:13:52| And we're asked Commissioner Lambert has been very active in the Republican Party for more than 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| including campaigning for candidates at the local, state, and federal levels of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| And whereas an acknowledged community activist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| Greg Lambert was a leader in the petition drive to repeal the Knox County Will Tax some years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4445)|
| 1:14:11| And whereas, while on the commission, Commissioner Lambert has been especially noted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| for being a strong proponent of the Second Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| and his passionate advocacy of the rights of property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4458)|
| 1:14:22| and discouragement of the use of eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| The Commission of Knox County hereby honors and thanks Greg Lumpy Lambert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| for his years of service on the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| representing the people of the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| And we wish him the very best in all his future endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4478)|
| 1:14:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| In 2008, when I decided to run for office, Greg and I were not on the same side in my primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| But very soon afterwards, Greg was very helpful and lent advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4489)|
| 1:14:55| And, you know, people talk about Greg being passionate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| and commission meetings are going to be much quieter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| But the thing that most people that don't know Greg is that he's very smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| He knows his history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| He knows politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| He knows a lot of things that people just don't realize that go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4509)|
| 1:15:17| The thought process that he has on politics and the things that land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| and the things that you don't think about land use, the unintended consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| he's already thought those through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| He's been very helpful to me in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| And I thank you, Greg, for lending an ear and being helpful while I'm on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| I continue to legally call you September 2nd and talk to you about commission agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4536)|
| 1:15:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| Well, I think it would be fair to say that we didn't start out all that close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| And I have to tell you, I think that's changed over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| And I can remember when there was a neo-Nazi rally here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| and Commissioner Lambert and I were certainly opposed to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4559)|
| 1:16:04| thought it was absurd, ridiculous that people wanted to spew hate and venom on our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| We were both getting the same kind of comments back, and they weren't real good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| So Greg came to me and said, I'm sort of worried about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| I think I need to give you one of my guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| And after looking at it, do you remember this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| And I looked at him for a second and said, I'm afraid I'd blow my foot off or something worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| So, bless his heart, he went out and got me some mace and some spray stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| that I could carry around with me in case somebody came after me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| And, of course, the next commission meeting he probably jumped all over me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| but it might have been for pretty good cause, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| But Greg is one of those guys who believes passionately about his positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| He cares about people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| He worked hard in this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| And Brad's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| He is a historian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| He's a very smart guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| And I think he'll be running for political office in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| Sometimes stepping away from these kind of jobs is really the best thing you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| And there's not a thing in the world wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| But I also think it's a good thing when you can bounce back and come back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| And I was real flattered at a recent article in the paper when Greg called me publicly his friend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4624)|
| 1:17:12| because I'm sure he is, and that made me feel awfully good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| And, Greg, we want to thank you for your service on the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| and wish you the very best in everything you do going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4638)|
| 1:17:27| You know, this has been a really tough four years, both politically and personally for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4647)|
| 1:17:34| Awful lot's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| People pulling guns on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| White supremacists declaring me a traitor to the white race and saying I'm on their death list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4658)|
| 1:17:44| It's been rough at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| I will also say that the years that I spent serving Knox County have been some of the most rewarding years of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4666)|

| 1:19:55| and served on the redistricting committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4795)|

| 1:20:01| due to an amendment to the Knox County Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| which reduced the size of the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4804)|

| 1:21:07| And the resume that they just read into the record here, the Dogwood Arts Festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| the Ronald McDonald House, Big Brother, Big Sister, and on and on and on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4871)|

| 1:21:22| and thatís what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4882)|

| 1:22:09| And, you know, weíll miss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4929)|

| 1:22:20| before she ever thought about being a county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| And Commissioner Smith really summed it up appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| When you look at the volunteer activities that sheís participated in over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| talk about making your community better and really digging in and putting your heels into something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4951)|

| 1:22:49| And her tenure with us was sort of short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| Weíve had 42 different county commissioners during the last four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| Think about that, 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| And Michelle has been a really outstanding commissioner in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| Sheís done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| She cares about the 7th District and Knox County as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| And I want to wish her and Mike and their family the very best going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4986)|
| 1:23:10| Sheís a good friend and a good lady and has done a great job for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=4990)|

| 1:23:40| I believe that God put us all here to make a difference while weíre here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| And we live in a great country where weíre all given that opportunity to do for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5024)|
| 1:23:50| And I want to say thank you to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| Heís not seen the last of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5033)|

| 1:24:02| And I plan on working with him continuously because we have a big district and a lot of needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5042)|
| 1:24:08| And Commissioner Smith and I, I think, know those needs very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| So heís not gotten rid of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5052)|

| 1:24:36| I've told him I'm going to sit back there behind him and haunt him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| because he continuously aggravates with something over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| So I'm going to continue to aggravate him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5083)|

| 1:27:55| Commissioner Armstrong has worked to improve education in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5275)|
| 1:27:59| and the safety and security of our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| And whereas Bud Armstrong has been, and we trust he will continue to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| a strong advocate for improving Knox County's stormwater management ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| and truly dedicated to the welfare of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5290)|
| 1:28:14| And whereas the commission will miss Commissioner Armstrong's affability, sincerity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| and sage insight into the many issues confronted by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| And whereas Commissioner Armstrong demonstrated the utmost professionalism, ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| and integrity throughout his tenure on the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| garnering the respect and admiration of both his colleagues and the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| The commission of Knox County hereby honors Richard Bud Armstrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| for his service on the Knox County Commission representing the people of the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5322)|
| 1:28:47| We wish him the very best in all his future endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5327)|
| 1:28:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| Knox County Commission, a group of citizens stepping up to the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5336)|
| 1:29:03| Bud Armstrong steps into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5343)|
| 1:29:07| He has moved, he left TVA, the other end of Market Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5347)|
| 1:29:12| one evening to be a candidate to be on Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5352)|
| 1:29:17| We in the 8th District appreciate him stepping forward at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5357)|
| 1:29:21| As you see here behind me or you heard there earlier, Phil Ballard sat on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5361)|
| 1:29:27| He moved up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| He moved out of the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| Bud Armstrong has successfully filled that position over the last months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5371)|
| 1:29:39| I also look forward to Phil Ballard and I seeing Bud Armstrong doing other tasks within Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5379)|
| 1:29:50| and congratulate him on his excellent service to the 8th District on Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5390)|
| 1:30:00| You know, I can say a lot of things about Bud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| but I do want to comment just a little bit on that car ride with Mark Harmon and Greg Glamour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5402)|
| 1:30:09| And I want to tell you guys, if you'd been in the back seat like I was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| there's a little insight on what was to come for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| And you know that future was decided when Attorney General's opinion was overturned by the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5416)|
| 1:30:22| I'm one of the ones that served with 40 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| I have a pretty good insight as to the type of service of the ones that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5425)|
| 1:30:30| I came in with four others that was elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| I served with six others that were elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| Then the balance of those 40s that appointed, elected, you just sort of lose sight of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5435)|
| 1:30:41| But when we talk about individuals, I like to recognize each one of you all individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5441)|
| 1:30:46| And then I want to speak specifically a little bit here about Bud and the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| When you look at Bud, and even if you look at me, I think we're both considered athletes at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5450)|
| 1:30:56| You may not know this, but this was a track star, truly a track star.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5456)|
| 1:31:01| He was in the sprints at Carter High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5461)|
| 1:31:04| He was down in, I don't know, what was your 100, 10, 9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| 50-yard dash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| 9.6, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| This is a 9.6 sprinter right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| And if you look at the degrees that he earned, he sprinted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| One thing that maybe that you don't know about Bud, as you get degrees, there's a cost to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| What I know about Bud, Bud paid a lot of his own way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| He was even a lifeguard on the beach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| So Bud paid his own way to achieve this level of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| So when you talk about somebody that would work, Bud works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| He has the compassion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| You know, so he really, what you say, earned it by his merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| I think he served with each and every one of you all with merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| And I think you're all proud to know that he's a good friend of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5507)|
| 1:31:51| I know his family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| I know his friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| And he's not leaving the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| He'll be a strong support of David, and he'll still be a good friend of mine and yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5517)|
| 1:32:03| But I would like to recognize Bud for his service as a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5523)|
| 1:32:10| When Phil Ballard came to me and told me that he was going to run for property assessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| I thought, you've got to be kidding, because I thought Phil was doing a great job as county commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5534)|
| 1:32:20| and I really didn't want to lose him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| And then he said, I think you're going to like the guy who I think is going to replace me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| And he mentioned Bud Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| And I already knew Bud and knew what kind of fellow he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| We sat down to lunch one day at Litton's, and he shared with me his vision for the 8th District and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5550)|
| 1:32:35| And he started out in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| He said, I want to do more for our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| Let's make our schools better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5559)|
| 1:32:40| And then he went through a litany of things that he wanted to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| And he went on to win that election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| And I can tell you, you learn a lot about people when they win and when they lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| And he has handled those two imposters, as they say, just the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| He's always been himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5573)|
| 1:32:54| He's always been up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| He's always been above board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5576)|
| 1:32:57| And he's been professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| And Bud is a great example of citizen leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| And he comes up here to serve on county commission, but at the same time he has a law practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5584)|
| 1:33:09| and he does things the absolute right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| Being with he and his wife at events has been a real pleasure for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| I'm so very proud to call him my friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| And, Bud, thank you for your service as a member of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5598)|
| 1:33:27| Well, I thank each and every one of you for putting up with me during this tenure while I've served on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5607)|

| 1:33:39| because, as I've said more than once, and it doesn't get old saying it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5619)|
| 1:33:44| without them I wouldn't be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| And I'm not just talking about their votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| I'm talking about their support to help me receive an education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| many times to help me have a coat to wear in the wintertime, sometimes to have food on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5633)|
| 1:33:59| But I love each and every one of them, and I appreciate them to the bottom of my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5639)|
| 1:34:04| And I would like to thank them more especially for letting me serve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5644)|
| 1:34:11| Now, back to each and every one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| It has been a tremendous experience to work with each and every one of you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| We don't always agree, but we always debate in friendship, and we always leave with character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5658)|
| 1:34:23| and we always leave in the right state of mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| I hope that when I leave here tonight we can still leave in character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| and I hope that we can still leave here in the right state of mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5669)|

| 1:37:19| I wish I had started when we started the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| and maybe sometime when the ladies this winter, when it gets cold and you need something to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5843)|
| 1:37:28| you can go back over these records and add up the hours that have been specified by these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5848)|
| 1:37:35| that we're honoring here today, not only for Commission, but Mayor, for City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5855)|
| 1:37:42| Metropolitan Planning Commission, but their work in their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| Somebody once said very wisely that if you want something done, ask the busy person to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5867)|
| 1:37:54| As each of these have come forward today, and I don't think Paul is going to be any exception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5874)|
| 1:38:01| they're not through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| I think each of them will be still active in their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| They're not going to sit back and say, okay, I'm done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| because that's not the type of people that we have and that I've served with up here for the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5889)|
| 1:38:15| I think that Ray said it best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| Ray Jenkins said it best earlier when he said that Paul was probably the best as far as the watchdog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5897)|
| 1:38:24| and the cash walker of the financial side of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| And I think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| Somebody has to hold the purse strings, and I just hope that we can follow that lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| I appreciate what he has done, and also particularly for the senior center out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| And come Thursday at noon, you're all invited out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| I'm going to cook hot dogs on the grill that Paul presented to the senior center out south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5922)|
| 1:38:50| My first interaction with the Pinkston family was in 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| I was leaving the old Knoxville Journal, which is long gone, and as I was walking out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5934)|
| 1:38:59| somebody stopped me and said, hi, I'm Howard Pinkston, and we're both running for county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5939)|
| 1:39:04| And not long after that, I found my way over to what was then the epicenter of Knox County political life, Pinkston Motors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5944)|
| 1:39:13| And I don't use that term lightly because you looked at Pinkston Motors and you had folks like Bill Frist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5953)|
| 1:39:18| and Lamar Alexander and Fred Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| When they came to Knox County, their first stop wasn't at the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5961)|
| 1:39:26| It was at Pinkston Motors to see Howard and Paul Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| And when Howard was elected in 1990, I was elected at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| We served eight years together on the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| I got to know Paul very well because I was constantly, in those days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| we didn't pay a whole lot of attention to the sunshine law, to be blunt with you, like we do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5981)|
| 1:39:46| So I'd call over to Pinkston Motors all the time and talk to Paul and Howard about different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| and stop by there occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| And one of the proudest moments I had was when Howard asked me to deliver the eulogy at his funeral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5991)|
| 1:39:58| And he did that a couple of days before he died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| And he was a great friend, and Paul has followed in his footsteps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| Howard was a fiscal conservative. Paul was a fiscal conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6005)|
| 1:40:08| Really watched the purse strings tightly in money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| And we'd meet together privately on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| Paul was always concerned about, are we spending too much money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| Can we cut this? Can we cut that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| But it was all with very well-intended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| So as Paul leaves the county commission, I think that he and Dorothy are going to sit back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6020)|
| 1:40:24| and probably enjoy themselves a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| Howard has been a hard worker. He's tireless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| And I was mentioning earlier about Dr. Bruce Walker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| and his commitment to that senior center in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| I can tell you Paul Pinkston had that same type of commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| And to make it better, he went out and got federal funding to match some county funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| so that we could have a much better center now than what we would have had otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6044)|
| 1:40:48| And once it opened, he was still there constantly working for senior citizens across our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6048)|
| 1:40:53| When we built the veterans home, same type of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| He was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| So, Commissioner Pinkston, I want to wish you the very, very best going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| And thank you for your service to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6060)|
| 1:41:05| I want to say it's been a pleasure to serve the citizens of South Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6065)|
| 1:41:11| That's been a great honor for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| But the best honor that I've ever had here is this commission, the honor they gave me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6072)|
| 1:41:18| I have never ran for anything up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| I was elected chairman of the BZA and twice on the finance committee as chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6081)|
| 1:41:27| And I've never asked for a vote yet on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| And that was just, I thought, a great honor that you all bestowed upon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| And I want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6097)|
| 1:42:01| This is resolution 113.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6121)|
| 1:42:05| Honoring Fenbar Saunders for his service as Knox County Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6125)|
| 1:42:12| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6132)|

| 1:42:16| Five-oh to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6137)|
| 1:42:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6138)|

| 1:42:25| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6145)|

| 1:42:32| in the 4th Commission District after two years of laudable service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| And whereas Commissioner Saunders served on the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| with the core beliefs that a good education is economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| development is necessary for Knox County's future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| and that elected officials should lead by example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| And whereas after receiving a bachelor's degree in history and political science| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| from Transylvania University, Fenbar embarked upon a career of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| beginning with his service as a U.S. Army officer in Vietnam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| And whereas Commissioner Saunders has demonstrated a passion for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| and commitment to community involvement throughout his 30-plus years of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6183)|
| 1:43:08| in various civic and community organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| including the West Knox Sertoma Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6191)|

| 1:43:44| on a variety of community organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| has cultivated his ability to bring people together to find common ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| and to recognize the value of collaborative efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6231)|
| 1:43:55| And whereas, while on the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| Commissioner Fenbar Saunders commendably served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| on the newly constituted Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| And whereas Fenbar, his calm demeanor and thoughtful insight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6243)|
| 1:44:08| will be missed by the members of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| And whereas Commissioner Saunders demonstrated the utmost professionalism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| ability, and integrity throughout his tenure on the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6255)|
| 1:44:19| garnering the respect and admiration of both his colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| and the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| The Commission of Knox County hereby honors Fenbar Saunders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| for his service on the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| representing the people of the 4th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| We extend to him our best wishes for every success in all his future endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6276)|
| 1:44:43| I don't really know what to say about Fenbar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| He's done so much in his life and career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6285)|
| 1:44:50| Over and above his relatively brief stint in the elective office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6290)|
| 1:44:56| Fenbar and I have known each other about 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| We worked at the old Hamlin National Bank together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| And as the city councilman, I came across his path many, many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| because he was involved in so many issues that asked the city for this or that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6306)|
| 1:45:12| or was against this or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| But we had many, many times to work together through those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| I want to thank the citizens of Knoxville and West Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6319)|
| 1:45:23| for giving me the opportunity to represent them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| and share that seat with Fenbar these last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| It has certainly been a great honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| As we all move forward, I don't have to ask Fenbar to stay involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6332)|
| 1:45:37| because I know he will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| And I hope he looks at all opportunities that may come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6339)|
| 1:45:43| be they political or civically related or whatever they may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6343)|
| 1:45:48| And I thank you, Commissioner Saunders, for your service to West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| and West Knox County and all of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| because our county is a better place for what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6355)|
| 1:46:01| Well, I know exactly what I want to say about Fenbar Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| He is one of the most decent, honorable, kind, and smart men| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| that I have ever, ever met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| He is at the top of my list in so many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6372)|
| 1:46:15| He would come to events not only in his district but across Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| to be supportive of you and of me and of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| And when I would toss out an idea and Fenbar Saunders told me it was a bad idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6382)|
| 1:46:26| that idea dropped because I knew if I couldn't get it past him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6386)|
| 1:46:31| I sure couldn't get it past the rest of you because he's that kind of guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| He wants to do the absolute right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| He and his wife Ellen have been engaged in this community for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6398)|
| 1:46:43| And when our clerk was reading his list of accomplishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| how many times did you hear the word president of an organization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6406)|
| 1:46:51| Over and over and over because he is a leader and an absolute good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6411)|
| 1:46:56| There have been some people encouraging him to run for city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| City council would be really well served by having Fenbar as a member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6419)|
| 1:47:05| And I think he knows how much I think of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6425)|
| 1:47:09| He's done a wonderful job as a county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| And certainly this body and our community is better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| not just because of his service on county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| but because of his engagement over a large number of years in the very, very best kind of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6437)|
| 1:47:22| So, Fenbar, going forward, I wish you the absolute best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| You, sir, are a real class act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6445)|

| 1:48:08| I think together we have moved this county forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| I think that will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6492)|

| 1:53:29| I don't see a clear definition of the planned outcomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6809)|
| 1:53:33| what will happen if this project is a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6813)|
| 1:53:38| There is no definition of how the project will be managed by Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6818)|
| 1:53:45| who is responsible, what reporting method will be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6825)|
| 1:53:50| whether there is an interface to the financial system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| I am just very concerned about approving systems projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6835)|
| 1:54:05| without more detailed investigation into what is expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6845)|
| 1:54:11| We don't have a very good history at Knox County for systems projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6851)|
| 1:54:16| as evidenced by a recent $12 million loss in financial system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6856)|
| 1:54:24| that was supposed to be an enterprise resource management system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| that went away at warp speed, just like the Starship Enterprise, within five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6868)|
| 1:54:38| There has never been an accounting for what happened there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6878)|
| 1:54:44| I would caution the commission to know before you get started what is expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6884)|
| 1:54:54| and to have a firm handle on how you will know whether the project is a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6894)|
| 1:55:03| When you buy software from a firm, you're committing to an approach to how you do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6903)|
| 1:55:11| You will be paying maintenance costs for that software as long as you use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6911)|
| 1:55:17| Are there escalation charges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| What happens to the operating environment that that software resides in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6920)|
| 1:55:27| The people who are doing the job today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| do they know how much it costs them to do the job today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6930)|
| 1:55:34| And what are the expected benefits that they'll achieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6934)|
| 1:55:39| Are their jobs going to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| Are they going to get more information that will require a higher level of employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6941)|
| 1:55:47| in order to use that information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6947)|
| 1:55:53| I would like for you to consider that if you approve this today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6953)|
| 1:56:00| the new mayor more or less is committed down a path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6960)|
| 1:56:08| that he may or may not approve for the stormwater management division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6968)|
| 1:56:16| And in light of the fact that you have a resolution on your plate today, 9-12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6976)|
| 1:56:26| requesting an investigation into another division of the same department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6986)|
| 1:56:34| I would like for you to consider whether this is wise to proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6994)|
| 1:56:39| whether you might let the new mayor dictate where he wants that department to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=6999)|
| 1:56:47| and how he wants it to function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7007)|
| 1:56:50| At least, if nothing else, ask the questions as to how much this is going to cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7010)|
| 1:57:00| what are the benefits, and do the costs justify the benefits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7020)|
| 1:57:07| There is, as I understand and anticipated, interface to GIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7027)|
| 1:57:14| I don't see anywhere an interface with the financial systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7034)|
| 1:57:21| That's something that is lacking in the way we approach systems in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7041)|
| 1:57:27| from my perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7047)|
| 1:57:30| When we paid all that money for that Lawson system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| there was supposed to be a mechanism for work order management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7054)|
| 1:57:39| and reporting back to financial systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| Well, now that that's down the tubes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| is it going to be the responsibility of every department to find some piece of software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7065)|
| 1:57:51| to do what they need to do with no plan for interfacing to the financial management system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7071)|
| 1:58:02| So, once again, this is not a judgment of the project or the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7082)|
| 1:58:09| It's a judgment of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7089)|
| 1:58:13| I tried to download the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7093)|
| 1:58:17| which contains a bunch of information about what the vendor is proposing to provide for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7097)|
| 1:58:23| and that's another little problem that I see is the size of those files| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7103)|
| 1:58:30| really makes it tough to get them downloaded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7110)|
| 1:58:35| so that you can make any kind of reasonable sense out of what you're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7115)|
| 1:58:39| But I would submit to you, if not today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7119)|
| 1:58:45| as you get constructed for the new commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| that you set up for yourself some kind of minimal information requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7128)|
| 1:58:55| for what you need in order to make decisions of this magnitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7135)|
| 1:59:02| I addressed the Retirement and Pension Board just this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7142)|
| 1:59:06| about the same kind of thing that happened with a system that they got involved in a few years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7146)|
| 1:59:15| They are constantly spending money to try to maintain a system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7155)|
| 1:59:21| that still doesn't necessarily provide them with everything that it ought to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7161)|
| 1:59:28| and they've spent over a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7168)|
| 1:59:32| This is not peanuts, because what you see on this paper is the cost of the software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7172)|
| 1:59:39| What you don't see are the human costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| the extra additional things that comprise the implementation and the ongoing support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7182)|
| 1:59:50| So I'm just requesting that you defer your decision on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7190)|
| 1:59:58| until you can get some more information and until the new mayor gets into place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7198)|
| 2:00:05| and he can have an opportunity to look at whether this is how he wants that division to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7205)|
| 2:00:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7213)|
| 2:00:15| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7215)|
| 2:00:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| I thank you for eloquently putting that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7219)|
| 2:00:23| and I agree with you in terms of it needs to be able to plug into other systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7223)|
| 2:00:31| I actually work with a similar kind of work order data stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| data tracking system in my professional career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| and those interfaces are vital to have a valid system where you can reach out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7238)|
| 2:00:44| and get a good feel for where you are on a project from a financial standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7244)|
| 2:00:48| from a work resource loading aspect as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7248)|
| 2:00:54| I guess I will say, and I don't know what the sentiment of commission is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7254)|
| 2:00:58| but I will say that a system like this is vital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| especially when you're talking about dealing with a stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7261)|
| 2:01:05| with a federal kind of compliance issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7265)|
| 2:01:10| And I don't think you're saying that we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| I think you're saying that we need a system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| so I don't want to attribute those words to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| but I guess I'll just say for commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7278)|
| 2:01:22| I mean, this type of workflow management system is a key cog for an entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7282)|
| 2:01:29| the size of Knox County Engineering Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7289)|
| 2:01:31| So, again, I don't know what the flavor of commission is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7291)|
| 2:01:34| but I just wanted to put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7294)|
| 2:01:37| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7297)|
| 2:01:40| You know, this isn't going to change my voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| I have an awful lot of trust in the engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7303)|
| 2:01:46| and in our IT department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7306)|
| 2:01:48| But just so that she'll know that she's been heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7308)|
| 2:01:55| I'm going to bring the motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7315)|
| 2:01:58| I believe that she has brought some new information to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7318)|
| 2:02:03| It may not change my vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| but I do think that in fairness to her that I'm going to bring the motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7325)|
| 2:02:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7334)|
| 2:02:20| Thank you very much for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7340)|
| 2:02:25| We have a motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7345)|
| 2:02:28| We're going to have roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7348)|
| 2:02:33| Starting in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7353)|

| 2:03:54| has hit on something here that we all need to slow down and look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7434)|
| 2:03:58| A lot of these things right here, the new mayor coming in September the 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7438)|
| 2:04:02| maybe he needs to give us a little direction on these things. So, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7442)|
| 2:04:06| going to make a motion to defer this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| Second. Would you want to add to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7450)|
| 2:04:14| that some sort of plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7454)|
| 2:04:18| management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| reporting be part of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7462)|
| 2:04:26| I think the new mayor would probably put that in there anyway, but yes, I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7466)|
| 2:04:30| take that as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7470)|
| 2:04:34| We have a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| Commissioner Lutho. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I see Chris Grangeau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7478)|
| 2:04:42| out there. Would you like to speak on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7482)|
| 2:04:46| and maybe answer a few questions for us? Yes, thank you. Chris Grangeau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7486)|
| 2:04:50| Stormwater Management Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7490)|
| 2:04:54| Just to address some of the issues, I'm really glad that this was brought up. I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7494)|
| 2:04:58| the consideration of looking into a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7498)|
| 2:05:02| of this nature and size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7502)|
| 2:05:06| To go by some of the points that Ms. Cook brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7506)|
| 2:05:10| the human cost, that factor is actually included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7510)|
| 2:05:14| There's no additional staff requirements associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7514)|
| 2:05:18| the implementation. And the actual set up, the implementation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7518)|
| 2:05:22| the usual cost that you'd associate with a software project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7522)|
| 2:05:26| like this is part of the $213,000. So the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7526)|
| 2:05:30| is, you can think of it as essentially a lump sum cost for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7530)|
| 2:05:34| functional data management and work order system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7534)|
| 2:05:38| Probably the most important factor to consider is that the reason for this, there's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7538)|
| 2:05:42| EPA directive to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7542)|
| 2:05:46| Knox County is under a permit under the National Pollutant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7546)|
| 2:05:50| Discharge Elimination System, which means basically we're responsible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7550)|
| 2:05:54| showing that we're managing the quality of the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7554)|
| 2:05:58| discharge from Knox County into the waters of the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7558)|
| 2:06:02| A tool like this is essentially key to manage a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7562)|
| 2:06:06| municipal stormwater system the size of Knox County's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7566)|
| 2:06:10| because this will afford us the opportunity to manage monitoring data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7570)|
| 2:06:14| for streams, to manage permitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7574)|
| 2:06:18| enforcement cases associated with permitting, and really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7578)|
| 2:06:22| draw the dots together for a lot of the issues that certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7582)|
| 2:06:26| I've been here at this podium discussing with you all, or sometimes I may not have the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7586)|
| 2:06:30| right at hand when they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7590)|
| 2:06:34| called up. This is a tool that will allow some of that data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7594)|
| 2:06:38| recall and data connection to be done more efficiently and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| also reported to the state and the EPA, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7602)|
| 2:06:46| is really the directive that we're under in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7606)|
| 2:06:50| I should also note, yeah, this is big. This is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7610)|
| 2:06:54| not all of it. This is most of it. So I can understand it's a large PDF file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7614)|
| 2:06:58| We can't help with that part of it. But we did work diligently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7618)|
| 2:07:02| with the IT department and purchasing to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7622)|
| 2:07:06| we went through the proper protocol and all the hidden costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| and any kind of complications that may come as surprises down the road were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7630)|
| 2:07:14| addressed. This is, I guess it's not really an understatement to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7634)|
| 2:07:18| that this is an essential part of having a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7638)|
| 2:07:22| effective stormwater management system in a county of this size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7642)|
| 2:07:26| And also wanted to note that this is something we've been working on for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7646)|
| 2:07:30| We didn't want to rush this to commission, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7650)|
| 2:07:34| it's taken time to get everything just right and get everything in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100823part1?start=7654)|
