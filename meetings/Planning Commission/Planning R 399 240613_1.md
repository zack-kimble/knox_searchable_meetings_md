| 2:42:21| they definitely would like to see this concept plan be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9741)|
| 2:42:24| so we can move forward and acquire the property from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9744)|
| 2:42:27| and move forward on trying to get this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9747)|
| 2:42:30| and we could work out some of those issues, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9750)|
| 2:42:33| moving forward, and maybe even come back here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9753)|
| 2:42:35| for some tweaks if we have to, but I know that's a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9755)|
| 2:42:38| I think Mike could probably add some context to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9758)|
| 2:42:41| but we would ask that we get this approved today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9761)|
| 2:42:45| subject to maybe coming back and working out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9765)|
| 2:42:47| some of the finer details on that temporary turnaround on Road A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9767)|
| 2:42:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9777)|
| 2:43:01| Yeah, let me, before I get to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9781)|
| 2:43:04| let me get to Mr. Reynolds and let you try to recap for staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9784)|
| 2:43:12| as to where we are currently now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9792)|
| 2:43:15| with what the applicant has presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9795)|
| 2:43:17| and what you would recommend us do going forward here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9797)|
| 2:43:24| Just to clarify a couple of items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9804)|
| 2:43:27| we do have a landscape plan that was presented yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9807)|
| 2:43:32| There's actually two versions in that packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9812)|
| 2:43:36| One is on the concept plan, which is very basic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9816)|
| 2:43:39| It's kind of showing a line of trees around the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9819)|
| 2:43:42| as required by the zoning condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9822)|
| 2:43:46| The other landscape plan is a bit more detailed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9826)|
| 2:43:50| but it does have some areas where we want to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9830)|
| 2:43:52| existing vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9832)|
| 2:43:54| The zoning condition was specific to providing landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9834)|
| 2:43:59| along the entire property length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9839)|
| 2:44:02| I think that's something that can be worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9842)|
| 2:44:04| during permitting, but, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9844)|
| 2:44:06| literally the zoning condition says a certain thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9846)|
| 2:44:11| and so we'd have to make sure that that zoning condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9851)|
| 2:44:14| is being followed through with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9854)|
| 2:44:19| The other item, the variance for the Road B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9859)|
| 2:44:26| so the variance request as of right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9866)|
| 2:44:30| says to increase the maximum slope through a hammerhead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9870)|
| 2:44:34| turnaround on Road B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9874)|
| 2:44:38| As Mr. Mullins mentioned, that could potentially be changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9878)|
| 2:44:46| to eliminate the hammerhead word and just say turnaround| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9886)|
| 2:44:50| to increase the slope of the road grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9890)|
| 2:44:53| through the turnaround on Road B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9893)|
| 2:44:55| Condition number 10 of the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9895)|
| 2:45:05| requires cul-de-sac turnaround,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9905)|
| 2:45:08| so at this point with that 10th condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9908)|
| 2:45:12| a cul-de-sac is still required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9912)|
| 2:45:14| I think from the staff standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9914)|
| 2:45:15| that's what we were wanting to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9915)|
| 2:45:18| I guess the question is whether or not a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9918)|
| 2:45:20| really is necessary for consideration of a hammerhead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9920)|
| 2:45:26| so if they even wanted to approve a hammerhead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9926)|
| 2:45:28| would a variance be required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9928)|
| 2:45:31| As of right now, we're thinking yes, it will be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9931)|
| 2:45:34| It's not part of their current request to have the hammerhead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9934)|
| 2:45:37| well, it's not one of their requests to ask for a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9937)|
| 2:45:41| for the hammerhead right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9941)|
| 2:45:44| I think if the Planning Commission approved the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9944)|
| 2:45:51| modifying that one variance to eliminate the word hammerhead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9951)|
| 2:45:55| to say it's a turnaround through increasing the grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9955)|
| 2:45:58| of a temporary turnaround,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9958)|
| 2:46:01| then condition number 10 will still require that cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9961)|
| 2:46:08| If they want to do something different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9968)|
| 2:46:10| they'd have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9970)|
| 2:46:13| Which makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9973)|
| 2:46:15| All right, and then did I understand item number 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9975)|
| 2:46:22| applicant, or did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9982)|
| 2:46:24| We were going to talk about that today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9984)|
| 2:46:26| but we've talked to engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9986)|
| 2:46:28| We understand that they're just asking for the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9988)|
| 2:46:31| but they would pay for the improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9991)|
| 2:46:33| to those turnarounds there from Briar Glen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9993)|
| 2:46:35| We wouldn't be required to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9995)|
| 2:46:37| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9997)|
| 2:46:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9998)|
| 2:46:39| If you guys provide the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=9999)|
| 2:46:40| Knox County will construct them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10000)|
| 2:46:42| And that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10002)|
| 2:46:43| There is pavement already on our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10003)|
| 2:46:46| when this was originally platted in 1987, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10006)|
| 2:46:50| So with that understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10010)|
| 2:46:52| I think we didn't have a clear understanding on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10012)|
| 2:46:54| If Knox County is going to expand that the way they want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10014)|
| 2:46:58| we're fine with doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10018)|
| 2:47:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10020)|
| 2:47:03| Commission, who was first here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10023)|
| 2:47:06| Higgins or Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10026)|
| 2:47:07| Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10027)|
| 2:47:08| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10028)|
| 2:47:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10029)|
| 2:47:11| I remember when this came to us, I think it was January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10031)|
| 2:47:16| when we talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10036)|
| 2:47:19| I remember specifically saying that I would not be able to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10039)|
| 2:47:22| this without stub-outs to the adjacent neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10042)|
| 2:47:28| that already have stub-outs to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10048)|
| 2:47:32| I know that there were some neighbors here that said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10052)|
| 2:47:36| that they didn't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10056)|
| 2:47:37| But I also know that from a planning standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10057)|
| 2:47:42| it's been proven time and again that that connectivity is crucial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10062)|
| 2:47:47| for good growth and good developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10067)|
| 2:47:52| And really, it only makes sense to me to have those connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10072)|
| 2:48:01| and someone had the forethought that it would be good at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10081)|
| 2:48:07| because they're already laid out right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10087)|
| 2:48:10| So I think the neighborhood to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10090)|
| 2:48:17| Rosemont Boulevard, Heathwood Bend, maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10097)|
| 2:48:22| I don't think both of those need to be connected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10102)|
| 2:48:25| but I do think one of those needs to be connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10105)|
| 2:48:28| And Rushmore Drive also needs to be connected to the streets proposed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10108)|
| 2:48:35| And really, just think about the burden that all it takes is icy conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10115)|
| 2:48:45| or a storm or something and someone is blocked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10125)|
| 2:48:48| And to have that other route out, I think, is crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10128)|
| 2:48:53| And I think also just being able to flow and move around for both neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10133)|
| 2:48:58| So I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10138)|
| 2:49:00| Could we make a motion to require stub-outs in specific parcels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10140)|
| 2:49:11| Or in place of specific parcels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10151)|
| 2:49:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10154)|
| 2:49:16| You want to require stub-outs to specific parcels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10156)|
| 2:49:20| Yeah, parcel 80 and parcel 86.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10160)|
| 2:49:25| I think it would be appropriate if both of those were right-of-way stub-outs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10165)|
| 2:49:31| to the existing stub-outs on adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10171)|
| 2:49:39| I think that would be –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10179)|
| 2:49:43| technically you wouldn't be making a connection, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10183)|
| 2:49:45| to the adjacent subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10185)|
| 2:49:48| It's not in what was intended with the zoning conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10188)|
| 2:49:58| Commissioner Higgins, if I could respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10198)|
| 2:50:01| I don't think you can, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10201)|
| 2:50:03| because the condition was specifically with the neighborhood and Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10203)|
| 2:50:08| They did not want that connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10208)|
| 2:50:09| I understand why you want it, and we've heard that on several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10209)|
| 2:50:15| We talked about it there, but the zoning condition for the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10215)|
| 2:50:18| was no connectivity to those streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10218)|
| 2:50:24| I don't think legally it can be done because it's a condition to the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10224)|
| 2:50:27| I would defer to Council Blakeney or Director Brooks as well on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10227)|
| 2:50:34| but I think the county commission took that tool out of this body's toolbox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10234)|
| 2:50:40| when they did the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10240)|
| 2:50:42| I'll take your word for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10242)|
| 2:50:45| I will withdraw that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10245)|
| 2:50:51| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10251)|
| 2:50:52| Just a quick question, because looking at the subdivision variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10252)|
| 2:50:58| required underneath the alternative design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10258)|
| 2:51:01| one, as we have it listed on here, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10261)|
| 2:51:05| increase the maximum road grade from 12% to 13.8% for Road B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10265)|
| 2:51:10| matches what they submitted as their number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10270)|
| 2:51:13| However, I'm not seeing what they submitted as attachment one of number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10273)|
| 2:51:20| which is increase the maximum slope through the proposed cul-de-sac of Road A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10280)|
| 2:51:23| to 11.75 on the condition, so do we need to add that into the variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10283)|
| 2:51:29| is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10289)|
| 2:51:32| I think it's more just changing it, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10292)|
| 2:51:35| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10295)|
| 2:51:38| There's nothing in there right now about Road A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10298)|
| 2:51:41| We only have Road B and Road C listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10301)|
| 2:51:43| Oh, for the road grade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10303)|
| 2:51:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10305)|
| 2:51:46| Road A is only 11.75% grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10306)|
| 2:51:55| and the maximum a road can be without an alternative design is 12%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10315)|
| 2:52:00| so Road A meets the standard for road grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10320)|
| 2:52:03| Just wanted to double check since those were variances they had listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10323)|
| 2:52:08| I guess just to be clear, this might be an engineering question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10328)|
| 2:52:13| They're talking about going from 10% to 11.5% through the cul-de-sac, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10333)|
| 2:52:19| Am I understanding that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10339)|
| 2:52:21| Because the road grades inside the cul-de-sac are a different standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10341)|
| 2:52:26| so we would need to read that in, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10346)|
| 2:52:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10349)|
| 2:52:30| So the variance, there's actually a variance request on Road A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10350)|
| 2:52:34| which is for the cul-de-sac itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10354)|
| 2:52:36| I'm working off of Mike's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10356)|
| 2:52:38| Yeah, sorry, and I started talking about conditions and variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10358)|
| 2:52:42| and stuff before I handed out a potential number of conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10362)|
| 2:52:48| Yeah, I want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10368)|
| 2:52:49| So we got this kind of late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10369)|
| 2:52:50| We haven't had a chance to all get together as staff to work this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10370)|
| 2:52:53| but Mike did put this together this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10373)|
| 2:52:57| Did it just get passed out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10377)|
| 2:52:58| I think that's what Ms. Warner just passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10378)|
| 2:53:01| So it's separate than what the applicant passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10381)|
| 2:53:05| I've got them all in my hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10385)|
| 2:53:06| I didn't pass them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10386)|
| 2:53:08| Sorry, I was talking when it came through, so my apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10388)|
| 2:53:12| Okay, so that was where my question was coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10392)|
| 2:53:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10395)|
| 2:53:16| So I see other lights, so I'll wait to make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10396)|
| 2:53:19| and I'll start drinking some more coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10399)|
| 2:53:21| Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10401)|
| 2:53:23| I just want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10403)|
| 2:53:24| This is what you would recommend if it didn't say postponement, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10404)|
| 2:53:30| Like in the original?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10410)|
| 2:53:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10412)|
| 2:53:34| That number two, we would cross out Hammerhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10414)|
| 2:53:37| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10417)|
| 2:53:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10418)|
| 2:53:39| Again, I'm a little uncertain about the Hammerhead piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10419)|
| 2:53:42| and I might, again, whether or not that actually requires a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10422)|
| 2:53:47| even if we struck out Hammerhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10427)|
| 2:53:50| So I think that the Knox County colleagues are on the same page with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10430)|
| 2:53:54| Maybe another alternative would be to say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10434)|
| 2:53:57| this will be dealt with at a future, at another phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10437)|
| 2:54:01| if the applicant was willing to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10441)|
| 2:54:03| I want to be very careful and very clear that if it requires a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10443)|
| 2:54:06| we need to do that today during this approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10446)|
| 2:54:10| And I'm just, I'm not, to be honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10450)|
| 2:54:12| I'm not certain whether or not it requires a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10452)|
| 2:54:14| It takes a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10454)|
| 2:54:16| Ms. Brooks, I mean, would it, just the belt and suspenders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10456)|
| 2:54:19| would it be better to go ahead and approve a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10459)|
| 2:54:22| and then not have to use it versus, I'm just thinking out loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10462)|
| 2:54:27| I'm not sure exactly what the, I mean, the justification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10467)|
| 2:54:30| We just haven't had time to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10470)|
| 2:54:34| But, yes, if we're going to approve it today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10474)|
| 2:54:36| we need to figure out what the variance would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10476)|
| 2:54:39| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10479)|
| 2:54:40| I don't know if my colleagues at Knox County have a different opinion or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10480)|
| 2:54:45| We agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10485)|
| 2:54:46| We believe the sober eggs require a cul-de-sac,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10486)|
| 2:54:49| and so in order to put in a Hammerhead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10489)|
| 2:54:51| they would need a variance for that and provide justification for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10491)|
| 2:55:07| Mr. Schultz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10507)|
| 2:55:10| So this entire either cul-de-sac or Hammerhead turnaround| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10510)|
| 2:55:16| is only in here as a condition because it's not just a straight stub out, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10516)|
| 2:55:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10525)|
| 2:55:28| A turnaround is needed at the end of the road regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10528)|
| 2:55:32| Even if it's a normal stub out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10532)|
| 2:55:34| Yeah, I mean, a dead-end stub out, I mean, without a turnaround,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10534)|
| 2:55:38| can only have one house on both sides of the street without a turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10538)|
| 2:55:43| In this case, we've got a lot more than one house on both sides of the street here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10543)|
| 2:55:46| So it's required to have a turnaround of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10546)|
| 2:55:49| The cul-de-sac is the only thing called out in the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10549)|
| 2:55:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10553)|
| 2:55:56| Well, I'm a little bit confused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10556)|
| 2:55:58| and I think that this is not how we like to do business before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10558)|
| 2:56:03| with things coming in last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10563)|
| 2:56:05| I mean, I'm inclined to, if you guys want to work through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10565)|
| 2:56:09| but I'm inclined to just postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10569)|
| 2:56:21| Did we not talk about if there was something different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10581)|
| 2:56:28| that would be required with Road B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10588)|
| 2:56:33| if it didn't meet the guidelines of what we approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10593)|
| 2:56:37| that they would have to come back with a revised concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10597)|
| 2:56:40| prior to any final plot being approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10600)|
| 2:56:42| Or I'm just trying to talk through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10602)|
| 2:56:48| so we don't miss something intentionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10608)|
| 2:56:52| Yeah, my understanding is the request was to put a cul-de-sac on Road B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10612)|
| 2:57:02| Correct? Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10622)|
| 2:57:04| Yes, that's what staff was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10624)|
| 2:57:06| So that is a path forward as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10626)|
| 2:57:11| to put that in as a condition of the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10631)|
| 2:57:16| And that would be an additional condition in 14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10636)|
| 2:57:20| Condition number 10 already says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10640)|
| 2:57:23| So condition number 10 would require a temporary cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10643)|
| 2:57:27| at the end of Road A and Road B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10647)|
| 2:57:32| I think if we can go ahead and approve it with two cul-de-sacs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10652)|
| 2:57:35| and if we want to revise that and change it before final plot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10655)|
| 2:57:38| we can come back with another concept or development plan addressing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10658)|
| 2:57:41| and trying to justify the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10661)|
| 2:57:43| So we can go ahead and move forward today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10663)|
| 2:57:45| Let's go ahead and do it per staff's recommendation on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10665)|
| 2:57:48| That way we're not trying to tie ourselves up in any knots or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10668)|
| 2:57:52| And then we can look at it and come back later if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10672)|
| 2:57:58| So how do we solve for the variances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10678)|
| 2:58:03| Well, we wouldn't need a variance for the hammerhead at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10683)|
| 2:58:05| It would be a cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10685)|
| 2:58:06| And so the variances would just be for the different grades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10686)|
| 2:58:09| the change in the slope through the cul-de-sac for the temporary turnaround,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10689)|
| 2:58:14| which we have cited justifications for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10694)|
| 2:58:18| So, Mike, when we get there, just to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10698)|
| 2:58:20| under number four if we were to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10700)|
| 2:58:23| and somebody made the motion to approve the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10703)|
| 2:58:25| subject to the 14 conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10705)|
| 2:58:27| number 10 already spells out that both roads have to have a cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10707)|
| 2:58:32| Nothing about a hammerhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10712)|
| 2:58:33| It's just a pure cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10713)|
| 2:58:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10715)|
| 2:58:36| So would we eliminate one of the variances that you have on your list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10716)|
| 2:58:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10719)|
| 2:58:40| Basically you would change variance number two to mirror variance number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10720)|
| 2:58:45| It would say increase the maximum slope through the cul-de-sac of road B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10725)|
| 2:58:52| instead of through the hammerhead turnaround on road B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10732)|
| 2:58:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10738)|
| 2:59:12| Could we ask the applicant to please provide a hardship for those variances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10752)|
| 2:59:18| And we gave those in writings when we passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10758)|
| 2:59:21| I'd be glad to read for –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10761)|
| 2:59:23| We know you have them up here, but for the record –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10763)|
| 2:59:26| I would be glad to read them into the record then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10766)|
| 2:59:28| The variance requested for road A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10768)|
| 2:59:31| increase maximum slope through the proposed cul-de-sac of road A to 11.75 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10771)|
| 2:59:37| Four different justifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10777)|
| 2:59:39| The increase in the road slope is due to the topography of the existing property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10779)|
| 2:59:43| The proposed increase in slope will also allow the road to better accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10783)|
| 2:59:46| a future connection to the property north of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10786)|
| 2:59:50| B, the unique topography of the property and future road extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10790)|
| 2:59:53| is the basis for the request, reference, description, and item A above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10793)|
| 2:59:59| C, the purpose of the variance is not based exclusively for the desire of a financial gain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10799)|
| 3:00:03| but is a result of the physical attributes of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10803)|
| 3:00:06| And D, the variance will not be a detriment to the public's safety, health, or welfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10806)|
| 3:00:11| or be injurious to other properties and improvements in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10811)|
| 3:00:15| That would be the variance justifications for road A to 11.75 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10815)|
| 3:00:21| The justifications for road B going from 10 percent to 13.8 percent for the proposed cul-de-sac is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10821)|
| 3:00:32| one, the increase in road slope is due to the topography of the existing property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10832)|
| 3:00:36| The proposed increase in slope will also allow the road to better accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10836)|
| 3:00:41| a future connection to the property north of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10841)|
| 3:00:44| Two, the unique topography of the property and future road extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10844)|
| 3:00:47| is the basis for the request, reference, description, and item A and one above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10847)|
| 3:00:53| Three, the purpose of the variance is not based exclusively for a desire for financial gain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10853)|
| 3:00:58| but is a result of the physical attributes of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10858)|
| 3:01:01| And four, the variance would not be a detriment to public safety, health, or welfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10861)|
| 3:01:07| or be injurious to the other properties and improvements in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10867)|
| 3:01:11| If I could just add overall context to that, I mean, we're going uphill on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10871)|
| 3:01:16| and we have to, in order to connect to the properties above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10876)|
| 3:01:19| we have to have a temporary turnaround until we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10879)|
| 3:01:22| We can't do it any other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10882)|
| 3:01:23| And so if the only temporary turnaround is a cul-de-sac, then it's going to require these variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10883)|
| 3:01:28| so we can ultimately connect to the property and not leave that property landlocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10888)|
| 3:01:32| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10892)|
| 3:01:33| So if we do get a motion to approve the variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10893)|
| 3:01:37| what we would do is just cite the applicant's submitted hardships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10897)|
| 3:01:41| that just got read into the record, if you so choose to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10901)|
| 3:01:46| Well, I so choose to do that, so I'm going to go ahead and kick us off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=10906)|

| 3:05:43| I don't see any variances required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11143)|
| 3:05:48| The staff would, or excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11148)|

| 3:07:32| This is not something we can re-litigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11252)|
| 3:07:35| Those 18 lots or the location of Lantern Park Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11255)|

| 3:07:45| I can answer questions about the lawsuit and the history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11265)|
| 3:07:47| and I'm sure this may come up with them as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11267)|
| 3:07:50| but from our perspective, what has been approved is not relevant to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11270)|
| 3:07:55| We're talking about what we're asking to be approved on Mission Hills Lane only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11275)|
| 3:07:58| So I just wanted to keep that context in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11278)|
| 3:08:00| I'd be glad to answer any questions about it after the opposition has spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11280)|
| 3:08:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11285)|
| 3:08:13| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11293)|
| 3:08:14| Daniel Sanders here on behalf of Mass Creek Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11294)|
| 3:08:18| My business address is 920 Volunteer Landing, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11298)|
| 3:08:29| I had with me earlier Matthew Brooks, who's the president of the Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11309)|
| 3:08:34| He had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11314)|
| 3:08:35| He had an appointment to put a pet down this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11315)|
| 3:08:38| He wanted to be with his family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11318)|
| 3:08:40| Before that, he sends his regrets and has left it up to me to raise some objections to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11320)|
| 3:08:46| and we do ask that this board deny approval of the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11326)|
| 3:08:52| Our objections today are at least two, and I have provided the board with a handout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11332)|
| 3:09:01| and I'll go through these objections in reverse order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11341)|
| 3:09:05| The second one that we've raised in the letter is an issue of site distance along Mission Hills Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11345)|
| 3:09:12| Your regulations require site distance according to subreg 3.04J6B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11352)|
| 3:09:21| That points you back to 3.0J65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11361)|
| 3:09:27| J65 requires within Knox County the minimum site distance at intersections of any two streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11367)|
| 3:09:36| regardless of classification, and in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11376)|
| 3:09:38| a new driveway constitutes a new street and must meet the minimum site distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11378)|
| 3:09:45| Regardless of classification, it shall be measured from a point on a minor road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11385)|
| 3:09:48| at least 15 feet from the edge of the major road, a road or travelway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11388)|
| 3:09:52| and measured from the pavement surface to a height of I at 3 1⁄2 feet to the minor road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11392)|
| 3:10:00| to a height of an object 3 1⁄2 feet above the pavement surface on the major road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11400)|
| 3:10:06| The minimum site distance at an intersection of this particular road is 250 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11406)|
| 3:10:10| because it's the minimum, but it's also a 25 mile an hour posted speed limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11410)|
| 3:10:18| We've got some pictures there for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11418)|
| 3:10:20| There's a median.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11420)|
| 3:10:22| Mission Hills Boulevard is a median.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11422)|
| 3:10:25| It's constructed with a sign, several hedges, and some trees, and some light posts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11425)|
| 3:10:29| All of those items restrict site distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11429)|
| 3:10:33| We've got a picture here of the height of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11433)|
| 3:10:36| The height of that sign is 4 feet 4 inches above a mulch layer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11436)|
| 3:10:42| which it's a little bit further down, so it'll be a little bit higher to the pavement of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11442)|
| 3:10:48| We have some pictures here of some landscaping that is 4 feet 7 inches high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11448)|
| 3:10:57| and there's also a photograph showing a view at 3 feet 6 inches above Mission Hills Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11457)|
| 3:11:04| toward the proposed Lantern Park Phase II, and you'll see it at that height on the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11464)|
| 3:11:10| You can't see any part of this proposed Phase II development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11470)|
| 3:11:16| There's some additional photographs of the sign at 3 1⁄2 feet from Mission Hills Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11476)|
| 3:11:22| You can't see any of the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11482)|
| 3:11:26| The same holds true for the rest of the median.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11486)|
| 3:11:31| There are trees planted there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11491)|
| 3:11:32| There are light poles that obstruct the site distance along that direction of Mission Hills Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11492)|
| 3:11:41| A picture is worth a thousand words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11501)|
| 3:11:43| and so I think that provides you with a basis to deny this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11503)|
| 3:11:50| We raise another objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11510)|
| 3:11:52| As was mentioned, this was the subject of now five lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11512)|
| 3:11:55| The first one, we were successful, and I have a copy of the opinion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11515)|
| 3:12:00| The conclusion of that opinion, issued by Chancellor Weaver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11520)|
| 3:12:04| says the court finds and concludes, based on the foregoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11524)|
| 3:12:07| that the Planning Commission exceeded its jurisdiction and acted illegally, arbitrarily, and capriciously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11527)|
| 3:12:12| in not complying with the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11532)|
| 3:12:14| and failing to note the reasons justified, the variances granted for the 2022 concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11534)|
| 3:12:21| As required by subdivision regulation 1.05, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11541)|
| 3:12:26| I'm sure you guys have had workshops on this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11546)|
| 3:12:30| because now I can see by your meeting today that you are at least giving lip service to the variance request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11550)|
| 3:12:37| But, and there's an order attached here that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11557)|
| 3:12:43| therefore, the court must remand the case to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11563)|
| 3:12:47| for compliance with the statutory scheme and subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11567)|
| 3:12:50| That's the memorandum opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11570)|
| 3:12:52| The court order reads as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11572)|
| 3:12:59| In accordance with the memorandum opinion, the case is remanded to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11579)|
| 3:13:02| for compliance with the statutory scheme and subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11582)|
| 3:13:05| such as, and it gives some examples of things that you should do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11585)|
| 3:13:10| and ensuring compliance, ensuring that the concept plan complies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11590)|
| 3:13:14| with all applicable requirements of the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11594)|
| 3:13:17| including but not limited to, and it gives some additional citations to your subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11597)|
| 3:13:24| You are not doing that in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11604)|
| 3:13:26| This subdivision concept plan was remanded to you with instructions to follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11606)|
| 3:13:32| Instead of following the rules, you allowed the developer to withdraw this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11612)|
| 3:13:39| You are in violation, doing this is in violation of the court order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11619)|
| 3:13:43| and a subversion of the process for developing these subdivisions in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11623)|
| 3:13:47| We ask that you deny this concept plan. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11627)|
| 3:13:53| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11633)|
| 3:13:54| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11634)|
| 3:14:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11645)|
| 3:14:07| Off the bat, we accept staff's recommendation with the nine conditions with one exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11647)|
| 3:14:13| Staff's condition asks that a centralized mailbox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11653)|
| 3:14:16| a mail kiosk for Lantern Park must be located on Lantern Park Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11656)|
| 3:14:20| with USPS approval of the new location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11660)|
| 3:14:24| The subdivision regulations were amended in 2020 to take out any reflection of location of mail facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11664)|
| 3:14:31| That was Section 5.02.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11671)|
| 3:14:33| Because federal law preempted that, they can't tell you where to put a mail kiosk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11673)|
| 3:14:38| I gave you an email from David McGill who approved the location where it's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11678)|
| 3:14:43| There's a sidewalk that's going to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11683)|
| 3:14:45| There are sidewalks internal to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11685)|
| 3:14:47| There will be sidewalks along Mission Hills Lane that connect to a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11687)|
| 3:14:50| We've got the connectivity aspect handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11690)|
| 3:14:53| We wanted to put it on the common area that we owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11693)|
| 3:14:57| That has been approved by the USPS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11697)|
| 3:14:59| I don't think this body, the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11699)|
| 3:15:01| don't give this body authority to dictate where the mail kiosk goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11701)|
| 3:15:05| Other than that, we're completely fine with staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11705)|
| 3:15:09| I do want to mention or ask Director Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11709)|
| 3:15:16| one, if there's any sight distance or safety concerns about the five lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11716)|
| 3:15:22| that are on Mission Hills Lane based upon the objections raised by Mr. Sanders in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11722)|
| 3:15:28| Well, I think there is a break in that median.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11728)|
| 3:15:33| For the most part, I guess that would be southbound traveling traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11733)|
| 3:15:39| or traffic out of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11739)|
| 3:15:41| Folks, in my opinion, wouldn't necessarily be looking through those trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11741)|
| 3:15:45| They would instead be looking up the hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11745)|
| 3:15:47| which those trees wouldn't impede their line of sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11747)|
| 3:15:51| There is that one spot in the median where it does break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11751)|
| 3:15:55| and there could be that conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11755)|
| 3:15:57| If that conflict did exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11757)|
| 3:16:00| that vegetation that was referenced is in the public right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11760)|
| 3:16:03| and we could remove it or ask the applicant to remove it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11763)|
| 3:16:09| to ensure that line of sight was available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11769)|
| 3:16:11| Director Snowden, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11771)|
| 3:16:12| Following up on that, I know Massey Creek has done a very good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11772)|
| 3:16:18| in maintaining the landscaping there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11778)|
| 3:16:20| and they put a very nice sign right there at the front of the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11780)|
| 3:16:25| Is there a sign in that landscaping within the county's right-of-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11785)|
| 3:16:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11791)|
| 3:16:32| And did they have permission to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11792)|
| 3:16:37| They did not obtain our permission, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11797)|
| 3:16:39| So if there is a conflict with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11799)|
| 3:16:41| then that conflict can be cleared by working something else out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11801)|
| 3:16:44| relocating their sign or something of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11804)|
| 3:16:47| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11807)|
| 3:16:48| We would use that right-of-way to best benefit the public's safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11808)|
| 3:16:51| Are there any other safety concerns with the intersection separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11811)|
| 3:16:54| or the access of those five lots onto Mission Hills Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11814)|
| 3:16:58| from an engineering standpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11818)|
| 3:17:00| Not that I see, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11820)|
| 3:17:02| I do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11822)|
| 3:17:03| Time is limited on something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11823)|
| 3:17:05| There is a ton of history on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11825)|
| 3:17:07| but I want to just really kind of drill down into the heart of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11827)|
| 3:17:10| I did pass out a letter that I did pass out in 2022| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11830)|

| 3:17:19| they actually contemplated the Mission Hills Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11839)|

| 3:17:27| With regard to the court order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11847)|
| 3:17:29| the court invalidated the 2022 concept, as Mr. Sanders alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11849)|
| 3:17:33| because we weren't reading the variances into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11853)|
| 3:17:36| We're doing that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11856)|
| 3:17:38| They remanded it back and said, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11858)|
| 3:17:39| if you're going to go forward with this 2022 concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11859)|
| 3:17:41| you have to justify the variances and read them to the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11861)|
| 3:17:45| It didn't require us to move forward with the 2022 concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11865)|
| 3:17:48| We withdrew it and we went forward with the 2021 concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11868)|
| 3:17:52| which was already approved and had never been challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11872)|
| 3:17:55| They filed a lawsuit challenging that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11875)|

| 3:17:59| but that is not for this body to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11879)|
| 3:18:01| This body is looking at what we have in front of it today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11881)|
| 3:18:04| and is it meet the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11884)|
| 3:18:07| Per staff's recommendation, per Knox County Engineering Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11887)|
| 3:18:10| it does, and I would ask that you approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11890)|
| 3:18:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11892)|

| 3:18:18| Who wants this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11898)|
| 3:18:21| We've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11901)|
| 3:18:23| Oh, we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11903)|
| 3:18:24| Not a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11904)|
| 3:18:25| I'm just ready to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11905)|
| 3:18:27| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11907)|
| 3:18:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11910)|
| 3:18:32| I remember this coming through in 2022 and the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11912)|
| 3:18:38| and being very confused by the arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11918)|
| 3:18:42| I understood what they were arguing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11922)|
| 3:18:45| but it just didn't really make sense as a valid reason to not do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11925)|
| 3:18:49| So I do want to make a motion, but also I'll say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11929)|
| 3:18:55| Councilor Sanders, when I did mock trial in high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11935)|
| 3:19:02| and we had a case where part of the evidence was photographs of measuring tapes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11942)|
| 3:19:08| but you couldn't see the bottom of the measuring tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11948)|
| 3:19:11| And that really worked to my advantage in that case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11951)|
| 3:19:16| because we want a lot of cases off the fact that pictures of measuring tapes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11956)|
| 3:19:21| when you can't see the bottom are kind of useless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11961)|
| 3:19:24| So I think this isn't very helpful for the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11964)|
| 3:19:30| but also to the Councilor's point, all that is in the right of way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11970)|
| 3:19:37| and I think that it makes sense for, you know, if there's a conflict there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11977)|
| 3:19:42| the people who put it there should deal with that and not the new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11982)|
| 3:19:46| So with that, I want to make a motion to approve subject to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11986)|
| 3:19:55| I assume we should do eight of the nine conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11995)|
| 3:19:58| and not the second condition regarding USPS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=11998)|
| 3:20:02| I mean, it doesn't really matter what number two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12002)|
| 3:20:04| because it says if USPS denies the relocation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12004)|
| 3:20:07| they can provide that documentation to Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12007)|
| 3:20:11| and it just kind of stays where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12011)|
| 3:20:13| Okay. So approve the concept plan subject to nine conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12013)|
| 3:20:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12018)|
| 3:20:20| We have a motion by Commissioner Higgins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12020)|
| 3:20:22| a second by Commissioner Smith to approve the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12022)|
| 3:20:26| subject to the nine noted conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12026)|

| 3:20:38| Make a motion to approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12038)|

| 3:24:57| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12297)|
| 3:24:59| Thank you, Mr. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12299)|

| 3:25:01| I greatly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12301)|
| 3:25:03| We will move on to item number 58.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12303)|

| 3:25:19| Location is northeast side of Ford Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12319)|
| 3:25:22| northeast of Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12322)|
| 3:25:24| Approximate size of the track is 10,131 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12324)|
| 3:25:27| The zoning requested, or excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12327)|
| 3:25:29| the current zone is RN2 single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12329)|
| 3:25:31| residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12331)|
| 3:25:33| Existing land use is agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12333)|
| 3:25:34| forestry and vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12334)|
| 3:25:36| The proposed use is a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12336)|
| 3:25:38| The staff recommendation is to approve the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12338)|
| 3:25:42| for a two-family dwelling in the RN2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12342)|
| 3:25:44| single-family residential neighborhood district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12344)|
| 3:25:46| subject to three noted conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12346)|
| 3:25:50| We'll need just the one motion on the duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12350)|
| 3:25:53| Is Mr. Stinnett here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12353)|
| 3:25:55| He couldn't make it, but I'm representing him today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12355)|
| 3:25:57| I'm Tony Allen, 741 Banks Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12357)|
| 3:26:01| Is that your address again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12361)|
| 3:26:03| Yes, 741 Banks Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12363)|
| 3:26:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12365)|
| 3:26:06| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12366)|
| 3:26:09| Who pulled it off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12369)|
| 3:26:11| Oh, I pulled it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12371)|
| 3:26:14| I'd love to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12374)|
| 3:26:15| Yeah, I mean, you pulled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12375)|
| 3:26:17| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12377)|
| 3:26:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12379)|
| 3:26:21| I would, I plan to make a motion to postpone this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12381)|
| 3:26:28| I believe our bylaws allow for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12388)|
| 3:26:32| My reasoning is that with use under review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12392)|
| 3:26:37| we're supposed to be provided certain materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12397)|
| 3:26:39| that show whether or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12399)|
| 3:26:42| or that they'll allow us to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12402)|
| 3:26:45| I do think that a duplex is appropriate here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12405)|
| 3:26:49| but the materials that were provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12409)|
| 3:26:53| do not show a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12413)|
| 3:26:56| They show a single unit, elevations of a single unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12416)|
| 3:27:02| and drawings as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12422)|
| 3:27:04| but they also show the front elevation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12424)|
| 3:27:08| that is shown in the current slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12428)|
| 3:27:12| If you imagine, I guess, that that's one side of a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12432)|
| 3:27:16| and double that, I don't think that that is compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12436)|
| 3:27:19| with this block, this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12439)|
| 3:27:24| The houses on this street are all, all have front porches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12444)|
| 3:27:29| They all have just different, very, this stands out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12449)|
| 3:27:36| and I don't think that this current design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12456)|
| 3:27:38| that we're seeing is compatible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12458)|
| 3:27:40| but I also don't think that we're seeing enough information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12460)|
| 3:27:44| in the application to make a decision on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12464)|
| 3:27:48| So my motion is to postpone 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12468)|
| 3:27:53| to allow for the applicant to provide additional materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12473)|
| 3:27:58| and designs, if that's permissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12478)|
| 3:28:02| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12482)|
| 3:28:07| Commissioner, could you identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12487)|
| 3:28:09| what additional information you would think would be helpful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12489)|
| 3:28:12| The site plan did show two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12492)|
| 3:28:14| The site plan does, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12494)|
| 3:28:19| And I guess one question for staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12499)|
| 3:28:22| in regards to broadly use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12502)|
| 3:28:26| you know, we're tasked with determining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12506)|
| 3:28:28| whether it fits in with the surrounding context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12508)|
| 3:28:33| We're not a design board, I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12513)|
| 3:28:35| but we are, part of the requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12515)|
| 3:28:38| is to provide elevations that show the proposed property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12518)|
| 3:28:45| or development or building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12525)|
| 3:28:48| So I do think that if the elevations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12528)|
| 3:28:52| are within the scope of our review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12532)|
| 3:28:54| then even though I don't want to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12534)|
| 3:28:58| to be a design board or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12538)|
| 3:29:01| but looking at this single elevation that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12541)|
| 3:29:03| I don't believe that this is compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12543)|
| 3:29:05| with the surrounding context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12545)|
| 3:29:07| So the additional information that I would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12547)|
| 3:29:10| is a more, the elevations of an actual duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12550)|
| 3:29:18| and not a single unit, as well as maybe a design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12558)|
| 3:29:22| that shows a little bit more compatibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12562)|
| 3:29:24| with the context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12564)|
| 3:29:27| So perhaps showing a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12567)|
| 3:29:29| of the surrounding context and how this particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12569)|
| 3:29:32| this duplex might fit in with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12572)|
| 3:29:34| Is that what you're asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12574)|
| 3:29:35| In addition to the elevations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12575)|
| 3:29:36| but something that shows something a little broader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12576)|
| 3:29:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12578)|
| 3:29:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12579)|
| 3:29:43| So is that a motion to postpone for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12583)|
| 3:29:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12585)|
| 3:29:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12587)|
| 3:29:50| We have a motion to postpone for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12590)|
| 3:29:53| by Commissioner Higgins and a second by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12593)|
| 3:29:56| Commissioner Minus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12596)|
| 3:29:58| Yeah, I guess my question is for Lindsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12598)|
| 3:30:01| I feel like the zoning ordinance does have something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12601)|
| 3:30:03| regarding transparency on the rear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12603)|
| 3:30:06| I mean on the sides there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12606)|
| 3:30:08| I didn't know, does this design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12608)|
| 3:30:10| and it looked like it's 19.62% transparency on the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12610)|
| 3:30:14| but what about on the sides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12614)|
| 3:30:15| Is that appropriate for a duplex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12615)|
| 3:30:18| The principal use standards in the city's zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12618)|
| 3:30:20| have transparency standards for street-facing elevations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12620)|
| 3:30:23| so not the side elevations that would just face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12623)|
| 3:30:26| an interior lot line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12626)|
| 3:30:31| It just looks like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12631)|
| 3:30:33| and I guess along with Commissioner Higgins' comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12633)|
| 3:30:36| it looks like, I mean, that's pretty visible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12636)|
| 3:30:39| based on where the duplex can be positioned in this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12639)|
| 3:30:46| It would be nice to have some more windows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12646)|
| 3:30:48| if that's going to be a very visible side facing the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12648)|
| 3:30:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12654)|
| 3:30:55| Could we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12655)|
| 3:30:59| Could we get some clarification on what a special use review is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12659)|
| 3:31:05| like what this body's purview of a special use is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12665)|
| 3:31:08| Because I kind of have understood it to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12668)|
| 3:31:11| you know, we see a site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12671)|
| 3:31:12| do we understand that we think that fits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12672)|
| 3:31:16| that type of use is appropriate there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12676)|
| 3:31:20| You know, I feel like we're kind of getting down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12680)|
| 3:31:24| into some weeds of design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12684)|
| 3:31:26| but it's really about the use for the most part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12686)|
| 3:31:29| as far as I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12689)|
| 3:31:30| So I'd appreciate some clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12690)|
| 3:31:32| on what we are evaluating with a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12692)|
| 3:31:36| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12696)|
| 3:31:37| It is about the use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12697)|
| 3:31:38| but also there are some dimensional design requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12698)|
| 3:31:41| that are now included in the city's zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12701)|
| 3:31:43| So on page two of Ms. Crockett's report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12703)|
| 3:31:46| it does identify the standards for evaluating special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12706)|
| 3:31:48| So it talks about is it consistent with adopted plans and policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12708)|
| 3:31:52| Is it in harmony with the general intent of the zoning code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12712)|
| 3:31:55| Does it meet the intent of that particular zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12715)|
| 3:31:58| And then is it compatible with the character of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12718)|
| 3:32:01| where it's located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12721)|
| 3:32:02| with the size and location of buildings in the vicinity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12722)|
| 3:32:04| So I guess that's sort of what Commissioner Higgins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12724)|
| 3:32:07| was referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12727)|
| 3:32:09| And then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12729)|
| 3:32:10| does it significantly impact those surrounding developments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12730)|
| 3:32:15| And then it addresses traffic considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12735)|
| 3:32:18| and noise considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12738)|
| 3:32:21| Ms. Crockett, anybody else want to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12741)|
| 3:32:23| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12743)|
| 3:32:27| Commissioner Meyers, do you have any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12747)|
| 3:32:29| Oh, no, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12749)|
| 3:32:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12751)|
| 3:32:32| So we have a motion by Commissioner Higgins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12752)|
| 3:32:34| a second by Commissioner Huber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12754)|
| 3:32:36| to postpone this item for 30 days to get more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12756)|
| 3:32:39| for Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12759)|
| 3:32:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12764)|
| 3:32:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12765)|
| 3:32:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12766)|
| 3:32:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12767)|
| 3:32:48| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12768)|
| 3:32:50| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12770)|
| 3:32:53| It's postponed for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12773)|
| 3:32:56| Can I get more clarification on what exactly is needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12776)|
| 3:32:59| for the next application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12779)|
| 3:33:03| Our staff will follow up with you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12783)|
| 3:33:05| and give you a little bit more clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12785)|
| 3:33:07| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12787)|
| 3:33:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12788)|
| 3:33:10| If I could just also comment on my intention there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12790)|
| 3:33:13| We definitely see a lot of similar applications where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12793)|
| 3:33:19| or special use applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12799)|
| 3:33:21| where it does seem like the content provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12801)|
| 3:33:24| is a little bit of an afterthought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12804)|
| 3:33:26| But providing an application for a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12806)|
| 3:33:30| and only showing one unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12810)|
| 3:33:32| I feel like if we allow that it's not a good precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12812)|
| 3:33:37| in my opinion, for our purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12817)|
| 3:33:41| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12821)|
| 3:33:46| Commissioner Huber, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12826)|
| 3:33:48| No comment in this case, but before you adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12828)|
| 3:33:50| Before I adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12830)|
| 3:33:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12831)|
| 3:33:52| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12832)|
| 3:33:53| I guess we dealt with that one, so please go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12833)|
| 3:33:55| Are we done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12835)|
| 3:33:56| Everything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12836)|
| 3:33:57| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12837)|
| 3:33:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12838)|
| 3:33:59| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12839)|
| 3:34:00| It got withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12840)|
| 3:34:01| It was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12841)|
| 3:34:02| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12842)|
| 3:34:03| Well, I just wanted to throw out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12843)|
| 3:34:05| I guess it's been mentioned a couple of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12845)|
| 3:34:07| but today is the last meeting for Vice Chair Uten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12847)|
| 3:34:10| and Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12850)|
| 3:34:13| And I know they spent a tremendous amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12853)|
| 3:34:15| and a lot of years giving their opinions and help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12855)|
| 3:34:19| So I just wanted to recognize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12859)|
| 3:34:21| and tell them thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12861)|
| 3:34:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12863)|
| 3:34:24| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12864)|
| 3:34:28| I owe our beach chair something for not being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12868)|
| 3:34:35| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12875)|
| 3:34:39| I'd like to make a motion that we double the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12879)|
| 3:34:42| next month just for him not being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12882)|
| 3:34:46| So with that, Mr. Chairman, for the last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12886)|
| 3:34:48| I'd like to make a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12888)|
| 3:34:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240613?start=12891)|
