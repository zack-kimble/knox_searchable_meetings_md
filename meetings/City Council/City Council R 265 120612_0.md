| 0:02:16| For the Mayor's report, I have a few things here I want to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=136)|
| 0:02:20| First, I'd like to thank everybody for being here tonight and for those who are watching on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=140)|
| 0:02:25| We just wrapped up about three days of the Tennessee Municipal League Conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=145)|
| 0:02:32| Some of the council members were there with me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| Several hundred people from across the state were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| And I really want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| We got a lot of compliments on our hosting of the conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=159)|
| 0:02:45| And I want to thank our Office of Special Events, led by our Director Judith Foltz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=165)|
| 0:02:51| the Convention Center staff, and the staff of KTSC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| All of them worked together with the TML staff to make it a very successful conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| So just know we got a lot of thanks from our colleagues across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=179)|
| 0:03:06| We will have the unveiling of the portraits of two of our former mayors, Governor Bill Haslam and Daniel Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=186)|
| 0:03:14| at 2.30 p.m. on Thursday, June 21st at the fifth-floor atrium of the city-county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=194)|
| 0:03:24| So you're invited to come, and there will be a reception to follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| We're looking forward to that. Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| Also, I want to make sure the public knows that the city will hold its third annual event called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=213)|
| 0:03:41| City Business Opportunities for Your Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| It's an event at 7.30 to 10.30 a.m. on June 28th at the Jacob Building at Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| This is an opportunity to know what funds will be spent in the coming year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=232)|
| 0:04:00| that your company may want to submit a proposal or a bid on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| We'll have about $65 million in procurement that we will do over the next year from all the various departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=244)|
| 0:04:11| And so what we do is present an overview from each department on what those opportunities might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=251)|
| 0:04:18| And so we encourage businesses to come out and to learn about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| and then to find out how they can get on the bid list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| or how they can potentially get some of the business that the city will have over the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| So, again, that is on June 28th from 7.30 a.m. to 10.30 a.m. at the Jacob Building at Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=270)|
| 0:04:41| Also, I want to announce that there will be a community kickoff for the Downtown North Brownfields Grant Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=281)|
| 0:04:49| That meeting will be held at 6 p.m. Tuesday, June 19th in the community room of the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=289)|
| 0:04:57| So if you have an interest in Downtown North and that redevelopment, we encourage you to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=297)|
| 0:05:04| And also, Councilwoman Palmer, were you going to talk about the fishing at your park on Sunday or do you want me to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=304)|
| 0:05:15| I prefer that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| I got rained out and couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| The one that's coming this Sunday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| You'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Don't want to step on any toes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| Also, on Father's Day, by the way, we wish everybody, all the fathers out there, Happy Father's Day this Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=326)|
| 0:05:34| Our Parks and Recreation Department will hold its annual fishing event at Victor Ash Park in the 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| And there's always a good turnout and we will hope for good weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| That will be from 3 to 7 p.m. at Victor Ash Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| We thank Mass General Store for being a sponsor and also to TWRA for stocking the pond so there will be plenty of fish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=348)|
| 0:05:58| And finally, I want to call on Jim York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| He has a report to deliver to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=361)|
| 0:06:09| Jim York, Finance Director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| Under the provisions of our debt policy and in accordance with state regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| we are required to present a final report on any issuance of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| As you may know, the city issued $84.15 million in debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=384)|
| 0:06:31| We closed on that debt on May 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=391)|
| 0:06:37| With that debt, we were able to refund $91.66 million in outstanding bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=397)|
| 0:06:44| So we, in essence, reduced our principal outstanding by $7.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=404)|
| 0:06:51| We were able to save over the life of the refunding roughly $18.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=411)|
| 0:06:59| And it's approximately $1.4 million per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=419)|
| 0:07:06| In terms of the issue, it was a fairly simple issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| We did have some large bond premiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| That's how we were able to basically reduce principal significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| Overall, bond premiums on the issue were about 9.82 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=438)|
| 0:07:26| The cost of issuance, and you need to, again, we have to officially tell you this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| the cost of issuance, underwriter's discount was $593,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=451)|
| 0:07:39| Other issuance costs were roughly $252,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| All those were incorporated into the overall principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| So we've covered everything out of the $84.15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=467)|
| 0:07:55| I'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| If you read everything I sent to you, I'm very impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| Like I said, I'll try to answer any questions if there are any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| Jim, sorry I didn't catch you earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| Struggling trying to find the average coupon information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| is that an average of the new issuance or just the ones we're retiring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| The effective interest rate on the new issue is 1.934 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| And the ones we retired, is that the 3.9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| Yeah, roughly 3.9 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| Yeah, I just wanted to thank you, Jim, for sending the memo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| because that went a long way in explaining other than all the numbers you'd sent previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| which I must say I struggled with, but the memo helped a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| Thank you, Ms. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=537)|

| 0:09:05| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| Yes, I wanted to report that I will be having a meeting of the 6th District this Saturday, the 16th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=546)|

| 0:09:17| I believe that's 1927 Danridge Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| We will have David Brace and I think also someone from KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| And it's open to anyone that would like to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| We're especially focusing on our neighborhood organizations in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=572)|

| 0:09:45| And also I want to thank the Tennessee Clean Water Network for the ceremony that was held in the 6th District this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=585)|
| 0:09:54| at the corner of Biddle Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| And that was a very successful ceremony this morning, and we look forward to what's going to happen in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=597)|
| 0:10:07| So we thank everyone for coming to that this morning, and that's all that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=612)|

| 0:10:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| I appreciate the plug for the Victor Ash Father's Day event, and I do know that that lake was cleaned out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=615)|
| 0:10:23| The cleaning crew was there, so the fish will be in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| But if you're not a fisherman but you're a dad, the zoo is offering free admission on Sunday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=626)|
| 0:10:32| to any dad who is accompanied by a child, and you pay for that admission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| And they're challenging dads to be very daring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| And, of course, the new Safari Splash is open, but there are other things, including riding a tiger and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=641)|
| 0:10:48| So if you're not a fisher dad but you're a zoo dad, there's something for you on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| I would just like to announce I'm going to have my quarterly coffee with the councilman a week early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| It will be the 23rd, not this Saturday, but the following Saturday due to the 4th of July weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=662)|
| 0:11:09| I thought perhaps folks might be traveling or leading up to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| It's going to be at the world-famous Roundup Restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| Come and have a great breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| Hope to see you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| I just wanted to thank you and the Policy Department and Community Development for the meetings that were set up yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=684)|
| 0:11:33| in two locations, but to explore what's working and not working in development downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| as well as what's happening in the neighborhoods in terms of trying to reclaim blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| And it's obvious that some follow-up is needed, but the conversation was good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| and it got I think people putting some of the issues on the table and exploring some of the options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| And you had two good experts come in, Mr. Malik and Ms. Giovanni, I guess it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| Grassiani.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| Grassiani that came in, yeah, and they were helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| And I suppose they're going to prepare a report for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| Maybe they've already done that, but it's an important task that we're undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| We actually had a debriefing today with some of city and county staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| that are active with that vacant and blighted properties committee and with the two consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| And so we've got a lot of good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| And I'm not sure actually if there is a written report coming from that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| I'll have to ask the team, I'll have to ask David Massey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| But we took a lot of notes at the debriefing, and so we'll be meeting soon internally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| you know, city and county to follow up, see what we need to do next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| It seemed like one opportunity that needs to be explored last night at the neighborhood section was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=764)|
| 0:12:51| is there some way for the city to help, I don't want to say give loans because we're not in that business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| but somehow help to backstop loans so people can get that starter money to take these challenging projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=776)|
| 0:13:03| I mean, they buy sometimes a pretty damaged Hulk, and they want to fix it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| And convincing a banker that that's a good investment apparently has been a challenge for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=787)|
| 0:13:14| But they've overcome it in a number of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| But it sounded like the number one problem the small neighborhood groups were having of tackling the buildings by themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=796)|
| 0:13:23| And I don't know if there's a way to kind of love on our lenders somehow so that we can backstop some of those projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| that are worth doing anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| We have some loans now, the housing rehab loans, and that are, you know, revolving loan funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=812)|
| 0:13:41| the blighted property redevelopment loan program, which is not income based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| and has been used successfully in several neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| But clearly we need, one of the things we talked about today is we need access to more funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| than we currently have available, and federal funds are going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| So it's certainly a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| But it was that energy in the neighborhoods that really wanted to tackle these houses and uplift themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| If we can help that process, we win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| I also just wanted to ditto what Councilman Della Vopi had to say in terms of the meetings that you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| And if it is possible, if notes are written, I think it would be a good idea to give them to all my colleagues on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| Both sessions were good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| I did want to report that the sign committee, which has been going on, I just want to tell council that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| we have another meeting tomorrow night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| We're making headway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| It's a daunting task, to say the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| It's taken more time than what I had anticipated, and there's a lot more to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| Mark Donaldson has been very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| One of the main things that we've succeeded in doing so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| which eventually we will bring to council, is we've actually organized in a good way the sign ordinance that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=885)|
| 0:14:53| And now we're in the process of going through that, taking a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| Tomorrow night we'll be dealing with abandoned signs and amortization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| So we're working, and it's a hardworking group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| So I just wanted to give you a report on that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| And I might also ask my favorite question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| He's getting ready to bring his mic up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| Where are we on our shingles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| Well, unfortunately we've had a little setback on the west side, on the Lexington Avenue shingles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| because there turned out to be a problem with the person who had originally agreed to contract to recycle the shingles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=922)|
| 0:15:31| in that the recycled product apparently could not be used in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| They are exploring the potential for using the recycled product in both Georgia and North Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=936)|
| 0:15:42| which have apparently different standards than the state of Tennessee has for utilization of this second product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=942)|
| 0:15:49| In speaking with the owner of that property, he indicates that there are a number of options available out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| He is exploring those options, plans to come back with a new plan to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| Unfortunately, one of the options that's being considered is a landfill option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| and obviously we have suggested that that is certainly not our preferred option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| but that is something that he does need to explore in terms of efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| and in terms of returning the property to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| So that is continuing to be explored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| He plans to get back to us with a plan very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| He frankly didn't give me a date for that, but if I don't hear from him very soon, he knows I'll get back to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=984)|
| 0:16:31| And we, Angela Halber and our office, had a conversation today with the attorney who represents the owner of the East property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=991)|
| 0:16:41| the Borough Street property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| They are continuing to work with the contractor that they were dealing with before to try to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1004)|
| 0:16:53| Previously, they had indicated that there would be like a three-year turnover in getting it done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| and we had indicated to them that was just unacceptable to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| Apparently, there are some new developments in their situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| and they may be able to accomplish it on a much more timely basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| and so they're planning to get back to us very soon on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| So that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| We have not forgotten it, and we continue to pursue it on what almost seems a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| All I need to do is look at you, and you know what I'm going to say, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| I do, and I expect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| You should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| Okay, we'll move on to elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| 8A, a resolution confirming the reappointment of Henrietta Grant to the Metropolitan Knoxville Airport Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1051)|
| 0:17:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| 8B, a resolution confirming the appointment of Robbie Arrington to the Police Advisory and Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1067)|
| 0:17:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| I want to recognize Robbie Arrington is in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| Please stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| We appreciate your service on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| 9A, an ordinance to amend and restate the supplemental plan provisions of the City of Knoxville Employees Pension System| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1093)|
| 0:18:20| so as to affect certain amendments required under the Internal Revenue Code to maintain the pension system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| as a qualified governmental pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| I was going to ask if Mr. Swanson would want to explain that line by line to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| because I know that he enjoyed it as much as the rest of us did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| This is a housekeeping item, which keeps us straight with the Internal Revenue Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| This is not the later item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| I think that's as good an explanation as I could have come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| I was being facetious because it's very technical stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| Okay, this requires a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| Ms. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1142)|

| 0:20:31| Yeah, I wonder if I could ask, I guess Mr. Hagerman, are we doing a segment of this every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| Every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| What is the history of this alley paving that we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| We've been doing it, well, since before I've been around, something like five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| No, actually four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| This is the fourth year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| It's been rotating around the city more or less quadrant by quadrant, not much in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1252)|
| 0:21:00| way of alleys in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| These are the old inner city neighborhoods that had those alleys between the two rows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| of houses, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| The program was originally started to support a new zoning overlay that started up around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1271)|
| 0:21:22| four years ago that was an infill housing overlay and most of the, at least the alleys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1282)|
| 0:21:31| that required maintenance at that time and that overlay were apparently taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| early on, but there's a lot of other alleys in these older neighborhoods that are in need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1295)|
| 0:21:43| of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| And that's going to help the residents and garbage pickup and everything that we do to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| try to access those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| And a lot of the traditional neighborhoods, it's considered a real advantage to have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1310)|
| 0:21:57| alley because much of the utilitarian kind of stuff can go out back of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| The utilities, the garbage, all of that stuff is not out in the front of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| But there is a little bit of a maintenance issue and that's what we're taking care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1330)|

| 0:23:35| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| Mr. Hagerman, would you identify the location of these new bus stops, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| There's three of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| One is at Walbrook Drive in front of the Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| That's west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| Well, they're all three west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| Kingston Pike at Bearden Kroger's and Ramirez Boulevard in front of the Veterans Affairs Clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1432)|
| 0:24:01| That's just west of West Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Is the Walbrook location part of that transfer station setup for CAP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1446)|
| 0:24:13| Don't some buses have super stops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| It's part of the super stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| If you want to add some detail to that, I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| Cindy McGinnis, Knoxville Area Transit, 301 Church Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| Yes, Councilwoman Palmer, the Walbrook super stop is a super stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| and it was part of the design of rerouting all the routes to serve the new transit center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| We identified several areas in town where neighborhood routes could connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| without the need to come all the way in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| And this also has an advantage of taking the buses out of the Walmart and Sam's parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| which has been a real hassle for us because it gets very congested in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| Councilman Della Valpi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| As long as we've got Cindy there, I'm going to support this, and this is great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| but you need to get some of these up in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| They're dying for a few bus stops up by the Virginia College| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| where a lot of students go use your buses and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| And we hope that you reach to us soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| The last super stop that Council approved was the Fountain City super stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| and it's just sort of coincidental that all three of these are in the west area of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| We have to be very careful when we spread out our amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| that one area of town doesn't receive more than another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| And we do realize that the south needs some attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| and we look forward to the Henley Street Bridge being complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| and that we can focus some attention there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| Right, and these are not all super stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| Some of them we're just talking about just bus stations where you have a covered place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| and a pull-off sign that you can pick up folks in the rain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| and they can be protected while they're waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1552)|

| 0:26:11| with Arnstein Partners for the use of an existing basement area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| that extends beneath the Market Street right-of-way at 501 Market Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| Councilman Dela Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| Yes, I just don't see Mr. King here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| but Mr. Hagerman, before you were here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| we seemed to have something like this before when we were dealing with the old Millers building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| and where KUB is, and we started working on a sidewalk one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| and it made a mess in that vault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| I take it that we've got more protections in this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| I noticed that they had a duty to pull out their stuff out of the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| and hold us harmless if we wrecked their space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| I don't know the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| By the way, I didn't identify myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| I'm Jim Hagerman, engineering director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| The Millers building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| The Millers building has a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| I don't know with KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| I do not know the specifics of the arrangements there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| and one of the advantages of doing it the way that we're doing it in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| Just a permit to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| It's in place as an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| What are we calling it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| Yeah, it's an easement, so it's going to be registered on the ward map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| and if anybody goes to look at the ward map before they start tearing up the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| they will know it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| That process was not in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| Yeah, we had trouble finding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| Our crews didn't know that it was there until they ripped it open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| There was a breakdown in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| So we're going to have a better notification with the mapping and the easement stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1676)|

| 0:28:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1699)|

| 0:28:58| to adjust the city of Knoxville's classification and compensation plan for general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1738)|

| 0:29:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Yes, I didn't know if our civil service director is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| Vicki, we just did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| One fell through the crack or something, or one or two fell through the crack?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| This one, the request came to me too late to get it on the regular ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| but we still had time to get it before you and time to be effective July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| So this was just a straggler that didn't make it in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| so we still had time to bring it, so I thought I'd bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| Thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| 12C, an ordinance to amend Section 7.5-6 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| to clarify the duties of special counsel to city counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| Yeah, I'd like to, first of all, make the motion for approval and then get Rob Frost to kind of explain what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1798)|
| 0:30:11| Briefly, we found out through some litigation involving city council that the code is silent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1811)|
| 0:30:20| as to whom accepts service of process on behalf of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| The code specifies for the mayor that the law director accepts that service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| but it doesn't say anything for city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| There is the opportunity, if there's not an amendment such as that that's being proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1833)|
| 0:30:40| that if city council gets sued that process servers could show up at council's home or places of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1840)|
| 0:30:48| and incur needless costs, court costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| So we thought by codifying it, we would hopefully address that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| Councilman Dallavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| Yeah, I'm in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| I just wonder if we couldn't add a little tail to Section 1D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| where it says the special counsel shall be authorized to accept legal process on behalf of the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| in matters in which city council is named as a party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| If we change the period to a comma, we could put,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| and shall promptly notify council members of the litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| I know that will happen anyway, but if we're going to change the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| why don't we just put a little tail on it and have the language clear that we get prompt notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| I know you'll do it, Rob, so it's not a major item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| I think it's fairly harmless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| So I would move that we amend Section 1D to add the words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| and shall promptly notify council members of the litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| So we have a motion and a second to amend 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| We'll vote first on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| So now we'll go to the original motion or the original ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1919)|
| 0:32:06| Do we have a motion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| So that's amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| We have a motion and a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| So as amended, we're voting on that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| 12D, an ordinance to amend the Charter of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| specifically Chapter 412 of the Private Acts of 1923 of the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=1943)|

| 0:33:29| You want to go ahead, Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| What I want to say is, remember, we are, I believe the motion should be to send this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| not to approve this charter change, but to, the motion is to send this to the Pension Board for review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2016)|
| 0:33:42| which will then come back to Council to actually take a vote on first and then second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| And that's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| That's the motion I meant to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| We have a motion and a second to send this 12D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| And just for the sake of the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| this is the proposed hybrid pension plan as part of the pension reform that this administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2038)|
| 0:34:05| the City Council and employee groups and the public have been working on for several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| Well, I know we all worked hard on trying to get our arms around this subject matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| and to come up with the best hybrid plan that we could, both using the administration's recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2060)|
| 0:34:28| and information that we picked up during those various workshops and meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2068)|
| 0:34:35| I sit here and I still struggle, though, and I must say that this is not a bad plan, perhaps, as a hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2075)|
| 0:34:43| but it's very complicated and I still think it leaves us in the market risk business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2083)|
| 0:34:51| And I remain concerned that we may have this problem we currently have downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2091)|
| 0:35:00| I wish we had an opportunity to ask our pension board to look at a defined contribution plan that would be much simpler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2100)|
| 0:35:10| We could throw the eight or ten percent dollars in the pot and help the employees save towards their future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2110)|
| 0:35:18| and their retirement, but that we would not take on the market risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| I don't see the alternate motion on our menu tonight, so I guess this is the one before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2123)|
| 0:35:31| Switching subjects, I look at the complicated pieces parts of this thing to make it work, and I had several questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2131)|
| 0:35:39| One was, I didn't recall that we agreed that the $40,000 average salary would increase automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2139)|
| 0:35:47| Now, maybe we did, but on page 224, section F strikes me as going to give us that creep upward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2147)|
| 0:35:56| so that the defined benefit part keeps growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| It is rounded down to the nearest thousand, but it's an automatic growth based on the CPI, and I'm troubled by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2161)|
| 0:36:07| I thought that council would revisit that from time to time in the future, but it isn't written that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2167)|
| 0:36:14| On that same page, item H, I don't understand why we have the early retirement with 20 years of service in age 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2174)|
| 0:36:21| and I don't know, I mean, that's, we had a rule of 80 and a rule of 75 for uniform bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| This is like a rule of 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| I don't know why that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| I don't remember any discussions about that, but I'm troubled by that provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| and I don't know what it means cost-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| I don't guess we have our number cruncher here, but that seems a little unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| And the third comment I had with regard to this particular item was on page 231 of item 12D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2202)|
| 0:36:53| The COLA varies from zero to three percent, but I don't see anything in there about, there or elsewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2213)|
| 0:37:03| on how that would be the normal mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| We'd look at the CPI, but I thought we were going to make it subject to some discretion by council to decide whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2227)|
| 0:37:14| or not the money was available, and I don't see that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| And maybe it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| Maybe it's that percentage funding is the test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| But that seems different than I remember our original goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| which was to keep some control over that in case we were strapped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| and didn't have that kind of money in a particular year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| We might have to shift our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| So I was disappointed to see that we don't have any discretion left to make that available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| And then finally, on page, I said three there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| I guess there's four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| On page 232, item F, the employer contribution seems to be fixed in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2265)|
| 0:37:54| And, again, I'm not so sure that we shouldn't have a lever in there that has more flexibility so that if council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2274)|
| 0:38:04| for some reason, felt that some particular year that was undoable, that we weren't just compelled to throw it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2284)|
| 0:38:12| It seems to make it an automatic obligation, and I certainly think it's a fair set of numbers we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2292)|
| 0:38:19| It's 8 percent for general employees and a 10 percent for uniformed bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| But, again, if we're up against the wall, I don't know why that shouldn't have some kind of a safety valve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| and it doesn't seem to, to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| So those items continue to trouble me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2311)|
| 0:38:37| And that and the idea that we're heading down a path, we hope it works, but we may find ourselves in trouble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2317)|
| 0:38:46| makes me wonder if even though there are strong reasons to want to use a hybrid plan to attract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2326)|
| 0:38:55| and retain employees that a generous defined contribution plan wouldn't be a safer financial path for this council to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2335)|
| 0:39:05| Did you want us to address each of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| Are you looking for a response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Well, on the main one, I guess I wonder if we would still have an option at our next meeting to talk about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| or whether it's after the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| I think they meet on the 22nd or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| So we would probably not have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| I was told originally we were going to have an alternate motion on the docket, but it's not here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| That was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| And it may be that that interest has disappeared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| On the technical points, I think it is important to decide if we have some control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| Why don't we go ahead and address those just for the sake of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| The first one was your first issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| Let's go back to the early retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| It was item page 234, item F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| I don't know what subheading that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| 1381.1F under the definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| The compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| Page 224, number F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| It's the compensation cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| And it's the floating 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| And it goes upward based on the average of all employee salaries, I guess it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| It would be just the general mathematical average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| Yes, Councilman Della Volpe, and I will let Mr. Swanson join in as necessary as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| When we put this together, carefully did this, we did it based on the workshop going through all those items on the final workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| And we agreed or council agreed at that workshop to have that 40,000 be adjusted over time with certain constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2426)|
| 0:40:37| which I believe are all, in fact, I'm sure are all written in this as it's been, as it is referenced in the document before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2437)|
| 0:40:45| Well, it says it shall not thereafter be decreased once it has been increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| I mean, it's maybe that's only in a given fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| But we're going to slide this scale higher and higher just by cost of living and consumer price index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2452)|
| 0:40:58| And that's the, over time, of course, the dollars mean different things over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2458)|
| 0:41:05| This was, again, this represents the essence of the discussion at the workshop to have that 40,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2465)|
| 0:41:12| in a very controlled manner move up with inflation with the CPI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| All right, move on to item H, then, on that same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| Why do we have a 20-year service age 50 early retirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| What does that have to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| We picked very defined retirement ages, as I recall, 63 for general government and 50, was it 56, perhaps, for the uniform bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2486)|
| 0:41:38| Why do we have an early retirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| I mean, it may be a very good reason, but I don't remember us discussing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| That allows early retirement with reduced benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| It should be cost neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| What's the point of having that in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| I mean, that's a pretty young retirement age, age 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| Well, I think it's, again, it's cost neutral to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| It allows somebody who has, you know, at that point in their career to go ahead and leave early for a lesser benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| rather than having to stay on for a longer period of time to get the other benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| That's pretty commonly put in these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| And, again, in writing it up, we thought that was a good option to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2531)|
| 0:42:18| All right, I'll accept your explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| Let me move on to the COLA on page 231.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2540)|
| 0:42:28| We have the zero to 3% COLA, and then we have the possibility of adding an additional amount in the discretion of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2548)|
| 0:42:37| But I gather the first zero to three factor is pretty much following the consumer price index,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2557)|
| 0:42:46| subject perhaps to a limitation if we're grossly underfunded, we might cut that funding factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2566)|
| 0:42:53| But why isn't that somewhat more discretionary than it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| Well, this, again, the essence that came from the final work through of all these items was that the COLA be capped to 3%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2578)|
| 0:43:08| but that it have an automatic limit if the plan were underfunded, and that is the control mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| That's how council decided to, in that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| to approach the possible way to limit the cost of living based on the state possible status of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2597)|
| 0:43:26| And so underfunding was seen as the best lever, the best mechanism to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| rather than to have that be in discretionary council vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| So the only discretionary part in that D on page 231 is under sub four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2613)|
| 0:43:39| If you want to throw in more than 3%, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| And that discretion is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| It's capped at 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| And that discretion, you know, who knows, hopefully this won't ever happen again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| but some of us are old enough to remember 17%, 18% inflation, and at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| then we're in a different world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| But that's only at discretion of council to exceed the 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| Let's turn yourself to page 232.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| Okay, sure, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| I mean, because I don't remember it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| I thought it was the COLA was based on the funding percentage, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2647)|
| 0:44:13| It wasn't to go over 3%, but that was the way the lever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| The lever is the cost of living capped at 3%, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| Capped at 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| Capped at 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| So you're indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| Without explicit increase by council, if you want to exceed 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| So it could be zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| It could be zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| Based on the funding factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| But it could be more than 3% if you want to throw money at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| But that's our lever, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| I mean, on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| I mean, it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| If it's not fully funded, then that's our lever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| That's our discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| If it's not fully funded, then there's no COLA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| All right, now turn to page 232 if we're done with that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| The employer contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| I mean, those are wonderful targets and generous targets, 8% for general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| and 10% for uniform bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| But that strikes me that it has to have some kind of a safety valve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2704)|
| 0:45:11| I mean, what if that's undoable in a particular year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| We just go to the underfunding approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| Is that what we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| We have an absolute duty under this thing to put in those amounts, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2722)|
| 0:45:23| I mean, this is a commitment for a defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| And, of course, the nature of defined contribution, by definition of the words, is it defines the contribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| both at the employee end and at the employer end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| That is the downside to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| Obviously, if you're balancing the two, between a defined contribution and a defined benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| is that that contribution has to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| To have that vary or not be defined or be discretionary each year would take away from the entire commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| or essence of a retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| Well, again, I understand it in the context of a straight defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| but in this hybrid, I wonder about its wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| But, okay, that's what you say is the essence of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| There was one other comment, and I'm trying to find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| Wallace, did you want to respond to that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| Page 237.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| Nick, can you give the more descriptive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| Did you follow that last one or do we have to go back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| It was on page 232, and it was F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| It was the employer contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| and it was those percentages, and it spills onto page 233.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| On page 237, it's under the supplemental plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2794)|
| 0:46:41| No, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| It's under the miscellaneous, section 1381.7, subpart B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| and it says the voters reserve the right, power, and authority by amendment to the charter duly adopted to freeze,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2807)|
| 0:46:55| suspend, modify benefits, employee contributions, plan terms, design prospectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2815)|
| 0:47:03| or to terminate Division H consistent with applicable requirements of federal and state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| And, again, I think I already know Mr. Lyons' answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| but I don't know why the two words, comma, employer contributions isn't in there, that the voters reserve that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2833)|
| 0:47:22| I remember distinctly that Bud Gilbert was telling us no one would write a plan in this day and age that did not have the right to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2842)|
| 0:47:34| And yet, it looks like if you read this and want to play the Blackwell game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| someone will say you intentionally didn't reserve the right to change the employer contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| And you might have to do it by changing the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| and it might take one of those vote of the voters every second year in those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| But I don't see why we don't reserve that right as long as we're reserving rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| because there may come a time when fiscally we cannot do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| And I don't understand why we wouldn't put that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| Maybe it's inadvertent, but I suggest that we put the additional two words in that string in 1381.7B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2882)|
| 0:48:10| so that the voters reserve that right as well to modify the contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| because I think there may come a time when that's not doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| And I don't see why, as long as we're reserving a right, we're not exercising it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| We're just reserving a right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| So I think I'm going to defer to my attorney on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| That was one of those attorney inserted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| And those adjourned lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| I may have to defer to my attorney on it, but I believe the answer to that is this came in there as a result of action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| by the Tennessee legislature where they attempted to do everything they could do to compromise the Blackwell decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2918)|
| 0:48:47| essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| And they adopted a statute with this wording that said that you could do this in your pension plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| And so it seemed irresponsible since the legislature passed it to not put it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| But we just, as I understand it, we tracked the wording of the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| Mr. Mason is here and perhaps can be more definitive on that as Mr. Mason is, in fact, the author of the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2944)|
| 0:49:14| William Mason, Kennerly, Montgomery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| The language, it comes, as Mr. Swanson says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| from the legislation adopted by the General Assembly in May of this year addressing the Blackwell decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2961)|
| 0:49:32| I think, Councilman Dellivopi, the idea of the language here is that since this is a defined benefit plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2972)|
| 0:49:42| it's a hybrid plan, but it's a defined benefit plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| the employer is committed to the contributions to fund the benefits accrued to the date of the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2986)|
| 0:49:56| If you wanted to affect contributions accruing thereafter, you would modify the benefits prospectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=2996)|
| 0:50:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| But I thought we were told before that we weren't allowed to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| or at least we weren't allowed to do that without a good, healthy lawsuit that no one seemed to be eager to attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| And so if we're reserving rights, why can't we reserve that additional right to change it through the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3014)|
| 0:50:22| You say we have it automatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| My answer is that the right to suspend or modify benefits prospectively is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3023)|
| 0:50:30| or has the consequence of affecting the employer's contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3030)|
| 0:50:37| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| Covered by that language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| It's covered by the language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| To suspend or modify benefits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| It's all inclusive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Yes, sir, because it's a defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| Well, that's comforting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| I didn't read that in there, but that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| Those are my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| Although, don't be too comforted because Blackwell still exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| Let's put a repealer in here at the bottom if we just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| You know, this whole thing that we've been through for the last six weeks or so has been one of a real struggle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3068)|
| 0:51:14| at least for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| I work with an awful lot of people that don't have the kind of benefits that we do at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3078)|
| 0:51:24| And that's not to say that the city employees don't deserve this, but I'm concerned about where we're headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3084)|
| 0:51:33| I do know that it seems like that we've been given an awful lot of numbers over the last six weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| or eight weeks in terms of how much money we owe and how much it's going to cost and where we're going to go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| And so two of the questions I have, number one is, do we really know what it's going to cost us even with this new plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3104)|
| 0:51:52| the hybrid plan, in terms of cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| Where are we headed with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| The other thing is, of course, how are we going to pay for what we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| We've already put in quite a bit of money this year into the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| I'm concerned that where we're headed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| But one of the questions I have, let's just say that I'm a new employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| I'm coming to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| Can someone just very simply explain to me the pension plan that I'm about to get in very simple terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3133)|
| 0:52:20| I'm a new young employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| I've heard that one of the reasons that I want to be an employee here is because they have a fantastic pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3141)|
| 0:52:28| and that's why I'm going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| But this is pretty complicated to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| It's not that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| So would someone just explain it to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| Certainly, Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| In very simple terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| Well, I will try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| But even a councilman can understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| As a new employee, you will be engaged in the city of Knoxville's pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| which in ten years you will be a fully vested member of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| Up until that time, you will not have any benefits committed to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| Upon your entering that plan, you will contribute six percent of your salary into a fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3174)|
| 0:53:03| The city, if you are a general government employee, will contribute eight percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| If you are a fire and police employee, public safety employee, will contribute ten percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| That fund will accumulate over the years until you retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| And at such time as you retire, you will be at age 63 if you're general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3196)|
| 0:53:24| and 57 if you're at fire and police, with a couple of caveats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| But at that time, you will have that accumulated fund, which will generate an annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3208)|
| 0:53:34| That annuity will give you a monthly payment for your lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| And that annuity, the only guarantee to that is that annuity will you will get that amount unless it is less than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3219)|
| 0:53:50| unless it does not reach the level of a defined benefit portion that you will get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3230)|
| 0:53:56| which is equal to your years of service times two percent up to a salary of $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3236)|
| 0:54:04| So you will, at the time you retire, you will get the annuity based on your,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| based on the city's contribution and your contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| You are guaranteed that that will at least be equal to the amount that you would get from taking a formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3251)|
| 0:54:18| which would take your years, the years of your service times two percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3258)|
| 0:54:23| So if I'm making only $40,000 and retire, what do I get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3263)|
| 0:54:29| If you're at $40,000 when you retire, you will get, you retire after 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3269)|
| 0:54:35| That's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| After 30 years, if you retire, you will get then 60 percent of your final salary, which would be $24,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3276)|
| 0:54:43| And if I'm making $60,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| If you're making $60,000, you will get the value of the annuity that that contribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| the city made and you made into that fund, but that value, you will get that or the $24,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3290)|
| 0:54:58| whichever is greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| So you will get at least the $24,000, but you will get the annuity amount if that is greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| So you're guaranteeing me at least $24,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| At 30 years, we're guaranteeing you at least $24,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| That is basically the essence of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| It is really a defined contribution plan based on eight percent and ten percent city contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3312)|
| 0:55:18| and six percent employee contributions that pays an annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| The only caveat that makes it different from that defined contribution plan is there is an amount of which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| you're guaranteed to get if that annuity doesn't reach that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| And that annuity also, the money that you put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| and it's going to be based on how that overall fund does in terms of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| All the risk, when you put, I'm glad you asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| When the employee puts in his or her portion, the city puts in the city's portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| the value of that annuity will be completely dependent on market performance until the day that you retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3350)|
| 0:55:56| And if it doesn't reach, you know, it could go very high, and you could get quite a healthier amount yearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3356)|
| 0:56:02| It could not do nearly as well, and you get a lesser amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| That market risk is borne by the employee, future retiree, up until they retire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| at which time the city takes the risk of paying that annuity after that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| It's a shared risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| The safety level on all of these is at the $40,000 mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3377)|
| 0:56:23| Of course, that's adjusted for inflation as we discussed relative to Councilman Della Volpe's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| But in today's dollars, that's based on a guarantee of $24,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| So that's guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| Councilman Gray, please speak into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| I just said that's guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| There's a guaranteed up to a certain point benefit that is limited, that's capped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3398)|
| 0:56:44| And even in the future, if there is inflation or if that goes up, it can never exceed the average salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3404)|
| 0:56:50| So that's the capping on the city's obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| The rest of the annuity, the rest of the payout is purely dependent on market performance during the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| of the person's employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| So do we have to do we really don't have any idea what that plan is going to cost because we don't really know how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| many employees we're going to be hiring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| Well, we know that that actually we know we're going to be putting 8% and 10% continually into this fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3428)|
| 0:57:17| That is calculable based on how many employees we hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| Of course, it's all dependent on the size of the payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| So in that sense, that's the beauty of the defined contribution part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| That's defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| That's calculable once we see what the size of the payroll is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| What's unknown is how many people are going to be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| Here's where the city's risk is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| How many people are going to be affected by that 24,000 guarantee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| But, again, though, when we close the existing plan, all the employees that we have right now are under that plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3459)|
| 0:57:46| we're talking about closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| So what we're talking about is this hybrid plan is only for the new employees coming on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| Everybody who's employed to basically the end of 2012, give or take a few days and how this works, everybody now is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3474)|
| 0:58:00| under the present plan and will receive the benefits under that which they were hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3480)|
| 0:58:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| I'll let you know if I take the employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| As I think all of you know, I reluctantly support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| I find it, as Councilman Grieve and Councilman Della Vopi, to be very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| And I view this as a doable step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| And I hope it is only the first step that this council engages in as we look at our pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| and all our benefits, but specifically pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| I did find in looking over the detail that I thought it fairly reflected what we had, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3520)|
| 0:58:47| worked out in the last several meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| Nevertheless, my comfort level is not real high, but I am going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| Well, I mean, we've made huge strides here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| And I appreciate, Bill, you giving that simplistic overview because I think that's the people do ask you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3543)|
| 0:59:10| And you have to be able to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| The biggest thing we've done is a ten-year vesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| And you compare to what, you know, that's one of the biggest triggers we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| And that you limited it to 24,000 guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| That's one of the other big benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| And you've pushed some of the risk on to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| If they're part of it for that above that 40,000, if that grows in the market, then they get more possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3568)|
| 0:59:35| But ours is limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| I do want to call your attention to page 225.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| And this was added after our last workshop, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3582)|
| 0:59:48| That a person elected or appointed member of the legislative branch shall not be an employee for the purpose of Division H| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3588)|
| 0:59:56| with respect to his or her service in the legislative branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| And that's us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| That's what we asked for, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| That's what we asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3602)|
| 1:00:03| And I think it's clear to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| That was our intentions after the last workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| And I appreciate you putting that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| And I think that it will serve the city well as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| But that and the 10-year vesting are, you know, two big things that would protect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| You know, to me, you know, we're sending this to the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| You know, it's eventually going to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| And to me, we're giving them a choice between an expensive and risky plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3632)|
| 1:00:38| and a very expensive and risky plan, which is the current plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| And I don't think that's much of a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| And I don't think the taxpayers are going to think it's much of a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| So I think people know here how I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| In terms of the hybrid, to me, the problems are three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| It's confusing, it's expensive, and it's risky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| It's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| We just heard Dr. Lyons explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| I've been explaining to people similarly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| And people are very confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| He didn't mention hypothetical accounts, which I think are very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| I think annuities are confusing to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| When you say annuity, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| To an employee, how do they know how much that's going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| How is that calculation done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| None of that has been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| So, to me, it's very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| I don't know how that's a benefit if the employee doesn't really understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| Second, it's expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| We're looking at 8 to 10 percent contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| That's way, way, way more than what's going on in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| I think the taxpayers are going to think that's extremely expensive, given the times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3704)|
| 1:01:51| You know, to me, I think that's, you know, if you think 10 percent of payroll is 67 million, that's 6.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3711)|
| 1:02:00| You know, that's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| I think we're looking at lean budget years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| I would think that we would want to adopt something where there would be some savings so we wouldn't have to cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3723)|
| 1:02:10| or increase taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| Lastly, it's risky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| We talk about the 40,000, but really the real risk, a lot of it is with the retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| I mean, you could have a situation where the market really grows and these annuities really grow, and they retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| And then their benefit is fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| And then the market could go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| That's how you'll most likely see the system break, and it will, of course, be decades from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| But we're dealing with a problem that was created decades ago that's broken now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3755)|
| 1:02:41| And I don't want to create a problem that's going to break decades from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| And in terms of risk, the other thing that I think is important is this assumes 6.5 percent return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3766)|
| 1:02:54| The last 10 years, we've returned 5.2 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| Is that prudent to adopt a plan that's based on 6.5 percent when the last 10 years were 5.2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3779)|
| 1:03:06| I thought it was 7.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| That's the assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| The actual return for the last council has been 5.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| So why would we assume 6.5 going forward when the last 10 years we've been assuming 5.0,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| when we've actually been returning 5.2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| I think, I mean, to me, you should go conservative, not more, you know, optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3805)|
| 1:03:32| In terms of this year, our fiscal year starts on July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| I talked with Mike Cherry, and he gave me a rough estimate as of May 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| He said it was a very, very rough estimate, so I want to repeat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| But he thought our assets had grown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| After 11 months, they had grown negative 1 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| So we're adopting a plan that assumes 6.5 percent in a year that could be negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3832)|
| 1:03:58| I mean, that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| And for these reasons, I'm not going to be able to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| I failed to mention a moment ago in response to Councilman Della Volpe's concern about the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3849)|
| 1:04:16| Keep in mind, the pension board is not a policy body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| The pension board is an administrative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| We simply administer what the policy body, this body, and the mayor suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| And so that's all they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| They will review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| And I think Mr. Mason can speak to this if he chooses, as Bud Gilbert did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3869)|
| 1:04:35| that their responsibility in this is to look at it for form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| and to make sure that we've crossed all the T's and dotted all the I's and gotten it legally correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| Two other things that I meant to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| One had to do with the fact that I am concerned about where we're headed, you know, in the next ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| But the other question I had is that, this being as complicated as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3898)|
| 1:05:03| that it's my understanding that probably in the next two years we might be hiring how many people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| Ten, 20 maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| Who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| We may not be hiring any, you know, with the way the budget is and where we're headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| And so the question, one of the questions I have is that if, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3917)|
| 1:05:23| that the impact of the existing plan is not going to affect us that much in terms of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3923)|
| 1:05:31| that we're not doing anything with the existing plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| that I don't want to feel as though we've rushed into just trying to put something on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3934)|
| 1:05:40| that maybe in the long run we may regret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| And it seems like there's a number of questions that have even been asked over the hybrid plan that we're sending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3943)|
| 1:05:49| to the pension board that maybe we should think about the fact that we do have two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3949)|
| 1:05:55| Now, Councilman Saunders mentioned that, and so did Councilman Wallace, that we're not going to put this to bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3955)|
| 1:06:01| In other words, we still have issues to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| But if we think about it, we're sending, as Councilman Stair says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| we're sending in essence two plans to the general public of which even the hybrid plan still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3967)|
| 1:06:13| with Dr. Lyons' explanation, is still pretty confusing for the general population to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3973)|
| 1:06:19| And so I'm just wondering whether or not, since we do have the two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| and that we may not have that kind of effect on the existing plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| that maybe we should kind of regroup and really think about some of these issues that we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| And I do applaud you, Mayor, and the staff for what you've put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| But I do think that we have something that we need to really be seriously thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| in terms of what's going to be happening ten years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| Are we putting those people ten years from now in the same situation we're in now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| So I just throw that out to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| I'd just comment that that's been talked about at numerous workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| and Council still voted to move this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| And the other point to make is that the vesting is ten years on this new one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4019)|
| 1:07:04| so nobody will be locked in in terms of being vested to a plan for ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| So as the next two years are subsequent, if things change in such that this Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4029)|
| 1:07:15| or the administration feels like we need to bring changes to the voters, that is something that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4035)|
| 1:07:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| Any other lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4048)|
| 1:07:29| I think after we've had the number of workshops that we have had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| and we've looked at the problem quite intensively, I think we're in a good place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4054)|
| 1:07:42| Some of it because you're dealing with market rates, and that's unpredictable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4062)|
| 1:07:49| We're not going to be able to know exactly about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| but I feel confident myself that we're going to have a good plan for the present employees and future employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4073)|
| 1:08:02| I want to thank Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| I think he gave a good explanation to Councilman Greaves' question and summed it up pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4084)|
| 1:08:15| We have discussed this many times, and it's going to be questions as we go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4095)|
| 1:08:21| but I feel confident that the hybrid plan that has been put together will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4101)|
| 1:08:29| And in the future, as we look at the employment situations, people will apply for jobs with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4109)|
| 1:08:38| And as we look at the --" I'm not an economist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| but I believe we're beginning to see some light in terms of our economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4122)|
| 1:08:48| And one of the things that I've been thinking about as we, the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| is ending two wars that has caused a lot of expense in terms of life and money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4133)|
| 1:09:04| And as this changes, I think it's going to have some effect on our economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| and I think we'll be able to, when we look back at this period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| I think we'll be able to go forward, and I'm confident that we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| And those are my statements on the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| We have a motion and a second to send this proposed ordinance to the Pension Board for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4168)|
| 1:09:36| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| Three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| Steyer, Greaves, and Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| The motion passes and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| Twelve E, an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| zoning regulations regarding regulations for crematories, columbariums, and funeral establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4198)|
| 1:10:06| MPC approved nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4206)|
| 1:10:12| Councilman Greaves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| I would like to have discussion on this, but I would like to make a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| I think we probably do have some people that would like to speak on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| We do have some people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| So hold your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| Do I need to hold my motion, or should I go ahead and make the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| Probably would be better to hold your motion and tell the folks who wish to speak, speak, and then make your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| I think if we postpone it, we can't talk about it, can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| Well, if you make the motion to postpone, your discussion should be limited to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| That's subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| Which is to postpone, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| We'll go ahead with discussion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| And first, we have Carlene Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| Please state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| You know the routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| Name and address, and I'm going to start the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| Mayor O'Hara, members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| After listening to the last item, speaking about crematories, kind of the good news for the night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4269)|
| 1:11:15| which makes it a little unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| We're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| I'm here representing Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| Just to make it clear, we're not involved in a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| We did not take a position on any project in the Fountain City area, nor have I personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4286)|
| 1:11:36| We are here tonight asking for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| Fountain City Town Hall, under my signature, sent every member of council a letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| and I was able to speak with several of you and appreciate your time and your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| We're asking for a postponement for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| One of them has to do, of course, with the protection of the people of the city of Knoxville who may live near| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4313)|
| 1:12:00| or close by a crematorium, whether it's associated with a funeral home or freestanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4320)|
| 1:12:07| And I know that other citizens have spoken to that issue at MPC and at other public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4327)|
| 1:12:16| The other issues are some issues that I identified when this came to Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| And again, we're talking about an ordinance for regulations citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| It has nothing specifically to do with Fountain City any more than it does, you know, in Skip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| or South Knoxville or Sequoia Hills or anyplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| But some issues that I identified when looking at this with other members of the Board of Town Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4353)|
| 1:12:40| and that has to do with what appear to be internal inconsistencies of the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| within the zoning ordinance of the city of Knoxville between what's being proposed and what presently exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| I'm assuming that what council doesn't want more of and what the city administration does not want more of is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4371)|
| 1:13:01| discussion and disagreements as to interpretation of what the words and what the intent of the regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4381)|
| 1:13:09| what the words mean, what the intent of the regulations really was when they were passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4389)|
| 1:13:14| So we're asking for a postponement because of what we see as inherent conflicts that we think will come back to bite us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4394)|
| 1:13:21| in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| We're not opposed to citing crematoria and other things within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| That's not our point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| This has nothing to do with any past fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| It has to do with consistency within the ordinance, enforceability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| and the protection of the city of Knoxville residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| We appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| Thank you, Ms. Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| Our next speaker is Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4425)|
| 1:13:51| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| You won't have to start the clock because I'm not going to say very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| I'm Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| I reside at 104 Crawford Road in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4438)|
| 1:14:03| I want to speak of one of my greatest concerns in this proposed zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4443)|
| 1:14:10| There are no guidelines incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| In other words, how will it be known if a funeral home is operating within the regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4453)|
| 1:14:20| For instance, is the funeral home performing more cremations than embalmings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4460)|
| 1:14:27| How will emissions be regulated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| And how often will this be done and by whom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| I realize that MPC cannot enforce this new zoning ordinance, but for goodness sake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4474)|
| 1:14:43| please spell out in the ordinance some guidelines so that they can be acted on if it is found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4483)|
| 1:14:50| that they have been ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| Thank you, Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| I'd like to make a motion that we postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| For how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| What's the pleasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| Thirty days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| Thirty days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| About 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| Twenty-eight days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| Salt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| Twenty-eight days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| I respectfully request postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| What's the help everybody understand what you hope to accomplish during the time that it's postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4524)|
| 1:15:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| I'd like to have it postponed, number one, so that council, you know, God forbid we have another workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| But I think that this is important enough that we need some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4538)|
| 1:15:43| I think the speakers have brought forth some issues that we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| And so I would like to have a workshop and have clarity on this, for one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4548)|
| 1:15:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| Councilman Grave said those two four-letter words, work and shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| And I think we all cringed when he brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| I'm not sure that a workshop is what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| I think that perhaps the law department and the council attorney could address some of these concerns about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4573)|
| 1:16:19| inconsistencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| And since our focus is on being sure that we have an ordinance that is clean, clear, and understandable to everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4581)|
| 1:16:30| that that's something that probably legal ears and eyes need to address more than a workshop where we work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4590)|
| 1:16:42| I would support a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| But I would like to have, instead of a workshop, I'd like to have our legal ears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| and eyes from both sides of the mayor take a look at this, look at some of the concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4608)|
| 1:16:56| and then come back with something that we could look at and maybe give us a heads-up before it comes out in the package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4616)|
| 1:17:05| But, you know, this is where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| Maybe we need to let them know what concerns we have so they would have some direction rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4627)|
| 1:17:12| than just wander through the wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| I think we ñ I mean, it's got to be ñ if we're going to ñ it's got to be enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| It's got to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| And I think the law department, you guys need to tell us whether, you know, the provisions that has been submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| Is that legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4650)|
| 1:17:31| Is that defensible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| And is that enforceable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| And are we willing to go do the things that, you know, that he suggested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| And the second thing is, do you want Mark Donaldson to comment on, you know, make some comments tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| I mean, he's here, and they've raised some good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| And generally, I have some that I would ask him to respond to some of them while he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| Would you like to call Mr. Donaldson now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| Yes, let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| We have a witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| Mark Donaldson, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| I was just provided a copy of the letter by e-mail this afternoon and haven't had much time to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4679)|
| 1:18:09| But I would be happy to participate in a workshop if that's your intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4689)|
| 1:18:18| With regard to the issue of the language, it was our intent to recommend that we use language that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4698)|
| 1:18:29| differentiates between an accessory use and a principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| That language was intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| When speaking about an accessory use, we used the term facility for cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| And when speaking of a principal use, we used the term crematory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4722)|
| 1:18:47| With regard to the issue of accessory uses versus use on review, any use can be a principal use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4727)|
| 1:19:02| an accessory use, or a use on review depending on its situation and its placement in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4742)|
| 1:19:09| I would direct your attention to a fairly recent amendment that we made regarding accessory structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4749)|
| 1:19:15| where some accessory structures were used by right depending on their size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4755)|
| 1:19:23| but when they reached a certain threshold, they became uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4763)|
| 1:19:29| This is much the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| The code speaks of accessory uses in general terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| but we speak about a specific accessory use as a use on review and establish criteria for making that judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4775)|
| 1:19:45| And the use on review process exposes that potential use to public review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4785)|
| 1:19:52| and approval by the planning commission subject to site plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4792)|
| 1:19:58| So I think we have addressed many of the issues that are brought up in the letter already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4798)|
| 1:20:06| So the use on review brings it to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| So that's how the public is notified then that someone is considering a cremation facility or services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4810)|
| 1:20:18| and that's how the public would be notified is because of use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| I'd like to recognize Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| I've got a feeling she wants to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| Thank you, Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| Yes, and maybe we do need a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| Obviously, I disagree with most of what Mr. Donaldson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| Yes, there is a provision which deals with structure, an accessory use that is a structure known as a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4840)|
| 1:20:49| It's called a garage whether it is a use on review or a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4849)|
| 1:21:00| It doesn't become a garage when it's a permitted use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4860)|
| 1:21:06| and become a storage facility for automobiles when it's a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4866)|
| 1:21:12| as this ordinance proposal is suggesting with the crematorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| It's a crematorium when it stands alone, but when it's with a funeral home, it's a facility for cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4876)|
| 1:21:23| Now, you don't buy it and I don't buy it and neither are your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| It's a crematorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| It's a duck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| If it quacks, it's a duck, and this is quacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| So we have this kind of tortured language in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| Additionally, our code is very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| It says accessory uses are permitted uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| That means they are permitted by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| Don't confuse it with principal uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| It's permitted uses, which are uses by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| Ask Anita Cash, anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| You present your plans, you get a building permit, you build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| A accessory use that now requires use on review approval, which is the exact opposite of a use by right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4919)|
| 1:22:10| is troublesome to me and I think it calls into question the basic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4930)|
| 1:22:16| and makes questionable the very basic framework of this zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4936)|
| 1:22:22| So we would look forward to a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| We would look forward to a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| We would look forward to discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| Thank you, both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| I don't mind to have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| I mean, it's at the discretion of the five members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| I do really think that this is a legal question, and if it was discussed amongst the legal eagles, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4960)|
| 1:22:49| it would be brought back to us in 28 days as a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| And if we had, you know, further questions, you know, maybe we deal with it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4973)|
| 1:23:01| But I don't mind having a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| But I'm like Councilman Wallace and Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| I think this is more for the legal folks than it is for us to be fiddling around in the dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4988)|
| 1:23:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| Last week Councilwoman Palmer forwarded me the Fountain City town hall letter, which is being referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=4999)|
| 1:23:25| There are two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| And in my conversations with her, I expressed concerns about the uses permitted on review and accessory use issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5006)|
| 1:23:35| I mean, I'm first more than happy to meet with Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| I'm sure he is as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| That's not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| The second issue is the zoning areas where these things, these uses may be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5022)|
| 1:23:50| That's not a legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| That's a question of policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| And city council is the policy makers for the city are the ones who need to determine where these uses may be cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5034)|
| 1:24:04| But Mr. Swanson and I certainly will endeavor to meet in the very near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5044)|
| 1:24:10| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5050)|
| 1:24:11| I knew when I said workshop that that would be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| But at least it woke everyone up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| You know, you all discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| But as you can see, even Councilman Wallace, your questions to Mr. Donaldson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| and then the Carlene's comments and questions that we already started talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5063)|
| 1:24:29| What I see is that the legal folks get together and they look this over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| and maybe Mr. Donaldson goes ahead and does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| But I do think, at least I personally would like to hear what you folks have to say once they bring their ideas together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| so that we can talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| You know, George, I can't call you up and say, hey, George, what do you think about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| And that we have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| Plus, I think I've heard from several constituents and several people in the community that do want to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5090)|
| 1:24:57| and talk to us about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5097)|
| 1:24:57| And I'd much rather do that at a workshop situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| Maybe we should call it something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| You know, an informative session that where we have the general public come in and talk to us also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5102)|
| 1:25:09| Because there are people out there with ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| But I certainly didn't mean to imply that we just all of a sudden Thursday night have a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| and we take what we have in front of us and we just start talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| I do look that we have legal counsel and we have Mark's comments and the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5120)|
| 1:25:26| So I still would like to have my motion that we postpone for maybe it should be 60 days, and that if I can amend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5126)|
| 1:25:35| and that we have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5140)|
| 1:25:41| Councilman DelVal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| I've been missed in that last round, and I do want to get a few comments in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| Because I think what's important is that while there are legal issues to sort a proper way of making a clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5145)|
| 1:25:53| and enforceable standard, we also have policy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| One that Rob mentioned, what zone it's appropriate in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| But another one, what conditions should be added in a use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| Should there be some requirement for monitoring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| Should there be a different setback than 200 feet from the nearest house or school or playground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5168)|
| 1:26:14| You know, should there be scrubbers or bag houses or other best technology kinds of resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5174)|
| 1:26:21| that are used to make sure the public is protected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| Those are in our bailiwick and not the lawyers, and we need to talk about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| Maybe they're easy to talk about, maybe they aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| But those things about how do we have a good ordinance that allows this activity to go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| but still gives the public a sense of comfort, I think that falls right in our ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| So I think we ought to talk about those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| I'd like to hear from the attorneys before we decide on a workshop or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5204)|
| 1:26:52| Just so I can tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5212)|
| 1:26:53| Hear from them in some way, a report or whatever prior to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5213)|
| 1:26:59| Of course, that workshop would be what the majority wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| But I'd rather hear from them first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| You want to hear from me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| No, not necessarily right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| Yeah, I mean, I echo a lot of the concerns my fellow colleagues have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| And, you know, certain things about emissions and the regulations set on these facilities seem to be more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5241)|
| 1:27:30| I've yet to hear from anyone at county air quality, anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| I mean, what little -- well, I did a little more than just a little research when we first dealt with this in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| and I didn't support it at that location just because we haven't heard anything about safety concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5260)|
| 1:27:46| Even if they're completely safe, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| we need to hear something that goes all the way up through federal EPA because there's no set guidelines that say you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5268)|
| 1:27:55| burn X amount of bodies or emit this, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5275)|
| 1:27:58| So I would love to hear someone from the county come forward since they deal with this emissions issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5278)|
| 1:28:05| unless there's someone else at the city level that needs to address it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| So, yeah, I think it's prudent to have that discussion before we continue to wrestle this going throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5288)|
| 1:28:16| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5297)|
| 1:28:18| I would just like to remind my colleagues that we spent six workshops dealing with finances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| and the future of these people's finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| And this is a critical situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| I mean, we're dealing with a situation that probably a lot of us don't know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5308)|
| 1:28:34| Just like what Councilman Dellevaux had to say, I mean, the emissions and the safety factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5314)|
| 1:28:39| and where these things are going to be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| I mean, this is critical to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| And I think that the least we can do is really once we hear from the legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5323)|
| 1:28:48| and once we hear from MPC that we ought to have a discussion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| And so I still have my motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5336)|
| 1:28:57| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5337)|
| 1:28:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| If it is the will of this body that we have a workshop, then I think it is extremely important that we have people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5339)|
| 1:29:07| from the county who have monitored the emissions from the existing crematory present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5347)|
| 1:29:12| and that we have some be sure that we have a diverse group of speakers so that we're getting a big picture on all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5352)|
| 1:29:23| of the issues involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| So I didn't say I would support a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| I simply said if that's the will of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| You want a good one, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| I want a good workshop that's really worth everyone's time and effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5372)|
| 1:29:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5377)|
| 1:29:38| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| Yeah, I mean, I don't think anybody's running from work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| I mean, I hope that's not what's being suggested here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| But I don't believe that you do a workshop in a motion form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| I mean, we've got to look at a calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| I mean, the procedure is that, you know, the recorder's office will call and will poll that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5388)|
| 1:29:55| I mean, it's not part of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| Yeah, my motion is to postpone for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| The reason being that's not part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5400)|
| 1:30:10| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5410)|
| 1:30:23| He's in charge of the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| My motion is to postpone for 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5425)|
| 1:30:28| You got me all messed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| Fifty-six days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| And Mr. Kurth is standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| I recognize him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5437)|
| 1:30:38| Council recognizes you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5438)|
| 1:30:39| Thank you, Mr. Kurth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5440)|
| 1:30:41| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5441)|
| 1:30:42| My name is Randy Kurth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| I live at 4016 Sam Cooper Lane in Fatton City in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| And, you know, the issue came up about monitoring requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| I just want to remind everybody that it sounds like a workshop is in order because right now there are no monitoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5451)|
| 1:30:57| requirements for crematoriums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| The one that's out there existing right now, there are they have to do some monitoring for the opaqueness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5459)|
| 1:31:07| but there is no actual chemical monitoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| And, really, there's a lot of record keeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| They do a lot of record keeping, but there is no monitoring required for the effluent for a crematorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5471)|
| 1:31:17| So some basic facts like that I think are probably some things that would be good for everybody to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5477)|
| 1:31:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| Thank you, Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| So what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| Is that all the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| We have a motion on the floor to postpone for 56 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| A motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5497)|
| 1:31:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5498)|
| 1:31:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5499)|
| 1:31:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| 12F, an emergency ordinance to rezone property located on the northwest side of Washington Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| southeast side of McCampbell Drive, southwest of Mill Road from no zone to RP1 at up to 264 dwelling units for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5509)|
| 1:31:58| developed area and up to 5.5 dwelling units per acre for the remainder of site, subject to two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5518)|
| 1:32:07| City of Knoxville applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| Councilman Dalvopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| Yeah, I just wanted Mr. Donaldson to speak for a moment, but I understood this was recently a next in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5537)|
| 1:32:23| and we're going from sort of a lack of zone to an appropriate zone in that you have planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5543)|
| 1:32:29| as your recommended zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| You've applied the hilltop ridge guidelines for bonuses to protect the steep slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5551)|
| 1:32:40| but allow the developer a chance to get the value of the bonus factor in the lower areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5560)|
| 1:32:47| So I take it you're recommending this as a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5567)|
| 1:32:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5573)|
| 1:32:54| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| Why is it on emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5579)|
| 1:33:00| I can explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| It's on emergency because this is an annexation situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| Whenever you have an annexation situation, you have a piece of property that has no zoning classification attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5584)|
| 1:33:11| and you don't want a use to be there that gets grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5591)|
| 1:33:15| So you want to attach a zoning classification to it as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5595)|
| 1:33:21| If you're not comfortable in doing it on emergency, you don't have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| but there is a very good reason to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| and that's in order to avoid some type of grandfathered use that you don't want to have on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5606)|
| 1:33:32| Just out of the ordinary, I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5612)|
| 1:33:36| We don't do nearly as many annexations as we used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5620)|
| 1:33:41| We have a motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| 12G, an emergency ordinance to rezone property located on the northwest side of Washington Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| southwest of Mill Road from no zone to RP1 district at 5.5 dwelling units per acre and subject to two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5634)|
| 1:34:03| City of Knoxville applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5645)|
| 1:34:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| Councilman Dallavolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| Mark, this is just a companion piece that's physically separate and we're dealing with it that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5650)|
| 1:34:15| Yes, this is a much smaller parcel that is part of the same property owner's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5655)|
| 1:34:22| but not contiguous to the other piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| So we had to do it in two separate, treated separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| And that's the 1.34 acres we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5672)|
| 1:34:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5674)|
| 1:34:35| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5675)|
| 1:34:36| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| 12G, an ordinance to rezone property located on the northwest side of Old Millertown Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5678)|
| 1:34:43| northeast of Love's Creek Road, southeast of Millertown Park from R1A to C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5683)|
| 1:34:50| Keith Jackson, applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| Fourth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| Well, I guess I'm going to move to approve, but I'll have to ask a question, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| Councilman Dallavolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| Mark, I apologize, but this one here, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| Obviously, it's in an area that is generally commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| Is there some special activity with regard to this parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| What was the impetus for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| I don't believe the applicant identified any specific project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5718)|
| 1:35:24| He simply specified retail development in the C3 zone as his proposed use for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5724)|
| 1:35:31| It is adjacent to C3 zoning on two sides, and a third side is adjacent to the railroad corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5731)|
| 1:35:43| and the entire area in its vicinity on that side of the railroad is shown as commercial in the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5743)|
| 1:35:53| Right, and that strip development along that road is Millertown Park and Love's Creek is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5753)|
| 1:35:59| So this is just in keeping with what's already going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| It's in conformity with the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| We have one person signed up for public forum, but before I call on him, I would like to, Chief Rausch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5776)|
| 1:36:24| on behalf of myself and this administration and city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5784)|
| 1:36:29| I would like to recognize the passing of your father this past week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5789)|

| 1:36:39| I know many of us expressed that last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| but I just wanted to recognize what you've gone through and know that we're here with you, for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5801)|
| 1:36:50| Okay, for public forum, Mr. Rick Roach has signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5810)|
| 1:36:56| Mr. Roach, if you'd please give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5816)|

| 1:37:20| I'm co-founder with Lyda Mayer of Friends of Williams Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| and we've tried to be community ne'er-do-wells in trying to get the watershed back to full health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5844)|
| 1:37:35| And with you guys showing up today, it just made my heart happy, and I just want to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5855)|
| 1:37:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| I know you all have been working on that for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| so thank you for continuing to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| There being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120612?start=5870)|
