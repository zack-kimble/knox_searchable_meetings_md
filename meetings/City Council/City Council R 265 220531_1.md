| 2:00:53| both the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7253)|
| 2:00:56| made this recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| planning commission unanimously supported it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| followed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| and to some degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7264)|
| 2:01:06| I feel like we've got to be able to trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7266)|
| 2:01:09| both our specialists as well as the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| the government body that is also making the decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7272)|
| 2:01:19| So for that, the North City Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| it's been since 2007 that was established, that was 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7282)|
| 2:01:28| And yes, things have changed dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7288)|
| 2:01:32| And thank you, Mr. Speaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7292)|
| 2:01:37| for providing wealth of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7297)|
| 2:01:40| that you provided to Council Members today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| It has a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7303)|
| 2:01:43| It was to some point that building permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7303)|
| 2:01:48| have been below average since 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7308)|
| 2:01:51| which has created a trend and a deficit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| of over 17,000 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7313)|
| 2:01:57| and that occupancy in apartments is 99%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7317)|
| 2:02:02| Back to the city's renters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7322)|
| 2:02:06| it's 53% of city residents are renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| And so to look for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7329)|
| 2:02:13| to have somebody to come and look for property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7333)|
| 2:02:17| that is viable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7337)|
| 2:02:18| there are five plus multi-unit properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7338)|
| 2:02:21| within the area already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7341)|
| 2:02:25| And two, statistically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7345)|
| 2:02:28| which I was pretty shocked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| that over 70% of multi-unit housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| in the city is affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| So we need more quality housing than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7356)|
| 2:02:41| Then to have a developer who's committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| to affordable housing and targeting those at 60% AMA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7363)|
| 2:02:49| and I think that's a real gift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7369)|
| 2:02:50| We're talking about our first responders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| talking about our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7373)|
| 2:02:54| talking about our young professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7374)|
| 2:02:57| also in a vicinity that is accessible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7377)|
| 2:03:01| jobs, transit, all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7381)|
| 2:03:04| And so I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7384)|
| 2:03:07| I feel like that we're desperate for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7387)|
| 2:03:13| We talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7393)|
| 2:03:17| I believe in development responsibly and sustainably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7397)|
| 2:03:21| but we are desperate for housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7401)|
| 2:03:24| and a quality housing that's affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7404)|
| 2:03:31| I think, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| service to the city is not being able to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7413)|
| 2:03:43| Okay, thank you, Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| Council, Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7427)|
| 2:03:48| Just on a procedural note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7428)|
| 2:03:50| there hasn't been a motion made on this item yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| so I'll move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| That's obviously so we can actually vote on this item, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7435)|
| 2:03:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7439)|
| 2:04:00| Okay, motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7440)|
| 2:04:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7443)|
| 2:04:04| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7444)|
| 2:04:05| So we can, that way we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| now we can move from the procedural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7447)|
| 2:04:08| on to continuing our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| So I really appreciate what everyone has said here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7451)|
| 2:04:15| and just looking at the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7455)|
| 2:04:19| like Council Member Thomas had said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7459)|
| 2:04:24| I'm not sure that the RN-5 is appropriate here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7464)|
| 2:04:27| given the infrastructure and the surrounding housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7467)|
| 2:04:33| RN-2, it's not RN-5 unless you go across the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7473)|
| 2:04:38| So given what we're hearing about the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7478)|
| 2:04:43| I struggle to see how RN-5 is appropriate here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7483)|
| 2:04:48| given what we're seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| I just want to thank the neighbors who came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7490)|
| 2:04:54| super prepared with their remarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7494)|
| 2:04:57| and all that they told us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7497)|
| 2:05:00| Really appreciate the developer coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7500)|
| 2:05:02| and looking at how important it is for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7502)|
| 2:05:06| I think there's affordable housing in every district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7506)|
| 2:05:09| that's up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7509)|
| 2:05:10| We've all had votes on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7510)|
| 2:05:11| but certainly looking at where we're putting density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7511)|
| 2:05:15| and where it's appropriate for the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| I think it's a critical point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7517)|
| 2:05:20| So I see the challenge that is presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| with the jumped on as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7523)|
| 2:05:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7526)|
| 2:05:27| I think Council Member Ryder's slide was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| Yeah, I wanted to, in this discussion with my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7529)|
| 2:05:33| wanted to point out this development of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7533)|
| 2:05:37| makes me think of Pond Gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| which some of us were on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7539)|
| 2:05:40| I'm not sure everyone was on council when that got approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7540)|
| 2:05:44| That was 102 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7544)|
| 2:05:46| And the argument against that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7546)|
| 2:05:48| it was next to single family housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7548)|
| 2:05:51| and it was going to be a detriment to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| and it was going to make traffic unbearable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7553)|
| 2:05:56| It hasn't done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7556)|
| 2:05:57| I drive there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| I work right up the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| One of the issues was West High School traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7562)|
| 2:06:05| You give every high school kid a car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7565)|
| 2:06:08| you're going to have a traffic jam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7568)|
| 2:06:09| at three o'clock every afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7569)|
| 2:06:11| And there were some solutions to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7571)|
| 2:06:14| like reaching out to engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7574)|
| 2:06:15| and asking them to change the signal patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7575)|
| 2:06:18| for the lights at that time of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7578)|
| 2:06:22| per request of parents there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7582)|
| 2:06:24| But the fears of the traffic were voiced as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7584)|
| 2:06:30| with Pond Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7590)|
| 2:06:31| And this is a very similar, very skinny road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7591)|
| 2:06:34| between these schools and in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7594)|
| 2:06:39| The other thing, lost my train of thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7599)|
| 2:06:43| is I guess, some of my hesitancy is a small area plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7603)|
| 2:06:50| I understand the point of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| I feel like in looking at it, it's 12 years old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| and there's been a lot of water under the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| particularly in the past couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7618)|
| 2:07:01| since that small area plan was drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7621)|
| 2:07:04| Can the Planning Commission comment on maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7624)|
| 2:07:07| when something like that might get updated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| Because I feel like it's not reflecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7629)|
| 2:07:12| the current needs of our market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7632)|
| 2:07:16| Jeff Welch, Knoxville Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7636)|
| 2:07:18| We put a hold on the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7638)|
| 2:07:22| in order to accomplish the update of the rezoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7642)|
| 2:07:26| And that took 24 to 36 months to accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| We're, well, excuse me, proposed to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7649)|
| 2:07:34| a update to the land use plan this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7654)|
| 2:07:38| in hopes that it could be funded then in the spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| of, well, for the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| So we're working with city staff and administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7662)|
| 2:07:45| to determine the level of planning effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| the types of things that should go into land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7668)|
| 2:07:50| and our comprehensive plan would be subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7670)|
| 2:07:53| to the conversation over the next six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7673)|
| 2:07:56| So we have a conversation in six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7676)|
| 2:07:58| and then how long would it be before we have a plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| Then you would have to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7680)|
| 2:08:01| you develop the scope of services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7681)|
| 2:08:02| and you hire a consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| So, you know, optimistically 12 to 18 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7684)|
| 2:08:07| so you could get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| Okay, so about two years out from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| we could get update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7691)|
| 2:08:12| I'm not blaming you, Mr. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7692)|
| 2:08:14| I'm just trying to get a realistic time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7694)|
| 2:08:16| We're relying on information and we're referencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7696)|
| 2:08:19| information that's a little dated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7699)|
| 2:08:23| The other thing is that plan and stopping additional housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7703)|
| 2:08:30| is basically freezing in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7710)|
| 2:08:32| We have a lot of developments that are 30, 40 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| So you get no newer units in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7715)|
| 2:08:41| Anyway, I drove the area many, many times this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7721)|
| 2:08:44| Mr. Huber, in your preliminary discussions of layout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7724)|
| 2:08:50| have you looked at a connection to Sharp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7730)|
| 2:08:52| that dead end that comes to the back of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7732)|
| 2:08:55| We did look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7735)|
| 2:08:57| That came up at the public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7737)|
| 2:08:58| that I've had with the residents of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7738)|
| 2:09:00| They had asked if it could feasibly be connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7740)|
| 2:09:03| I instructed my civil engineer to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7743)|
| 2:09:06| and if it was possible that could we do that, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7746)|
| 2:09:12| But I default to city engineering to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7752)|
| 2:09:15| if they would even allow us to do that, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7755)|
| 2:09:19| But we don't have an answer on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7759)|
| 2:09:21| He did mention that there's a relatively significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7761)|
| 2:09:24| an eight to a 10 foot grade change between where he had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7764)|
| 2:09:30| or where Sharp Lane is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7770)|
| 2:09:33| and where he was envisioning the dirt being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7773)|
| 2:09:37| So if we can look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| I have no problem in looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| I just don't know if it's feasible at this stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7781)|
| 2:09:45| So it's definitely not a consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7785)|
| 2:09:47| for your primary entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7787)|
| 2:09:48| I don't think that would be a good plan for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| but it wasn't for to have multiple exits or entrances there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7790)|
| 2:09:55| There's no problem with it, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7795)|
| 2:09:56| I mean, I don't think it'd be a good access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7796)|
| 2:09:58| for the primary, as you said, but kind of a back access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7798)|
| 2:10:02| I mean, I don't have a problem with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7802)|
| 2:10:03| if it works engineering wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| So the other question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7805)|
| 2:10:06| did you consider or look at the plan development process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7806)|
| 2:10:12| The planning commission cannot recommend that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| It has to be your request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| Just curious if you have read up on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7817)|
| 2:10:20| and consider that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7820)|
| 2:10:21| No, and honestly, that's the first I've heard of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| I'm used to dealing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7824)|
| 2:10:25| It has been used a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7825)|
| 2:10:26| and there has to be a public benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7826)|
| 2:10:28| It's a little confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7828)|
| 2:10:30| Right, I'm used to that in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| It's a different animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7832)|
| 2:10:33| Right, I'm not familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7833)|
| 2:10:34| The one we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7834)|
| 2:10:35| Right, I'm truthfully not familiar with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| but as I look at the city zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7837)|
| 2:10:40| RN5 is really the lowest classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7840)|
| 2:10:44| of a true apartment zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7844)|
| 2:10:47| If you go to RN4, RN4 really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| it's got a maximum lot size of 40,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7849)|
| 2:10:53| So it's really, I think, meant for like an infill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7853)|
| 2:10:56| a single family lot that's being redeveloped in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7856)|
| 2:11:00| And three, go to RN3, it allows townhome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7860)|
| 2:11:02| Go to RN2, it allows duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7862)|
| 2:11:05| And RN1 is just single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7865)|
| 2:11:06| So RN5, just by the way recode works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7866)|
| 2:11:10| is the first opportunity that there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7870)|
| 2:11:14| for any style of true garden style apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7874)|
| 2:11:17| And unfortunately for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7877)|
| 2:11:18| because we looked at trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7878)|
| 2:11:20| any of this affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7880)|
| 2:11:21| in any of the lower densities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7881)|
| 2:11:24| and it frankly just doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7884)|
| 2:11:27| So I talked to somebody else completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| unrelated to this today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| and they had a single family home building project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| that they basically have postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7894)|
| 2:11:36| just because the cost of materials and the rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7896)|
| 2:11:39| So I think we have some of that going on in our market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7899)|
| 2:11:41| So we're not gonna gain single family housing that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7901)|
| 2:11:44| And then the market has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| and the other thing this person said was that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7906)|
| 2:11:48| and they're not a developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7908)|
| 2:11:50| they're one of my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7910)|
| 2:11:53| They do a project here and there once every five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7913)|
| 2:11:57| And they said, we've basically made homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7917)|
| 2:12:01| not we, but the collective we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| have made homeownership unattainable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7923)|
| 2:12:06| with the current cost of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7926)|
| 2:12:08| and all the people moving here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7928)|
| 2:12:10| And so that's the struggle that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7930)|
| 2:12:14| in deciding to have more units or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7934)|
| 2:12:18| is if you can't have more housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7938)|
| 2:12:20| and you keep having the pressures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7940)|
| 2:12:22| that are driving the cost up to unattainable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7942)|
| 2:12:25| I can't afford my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| I'm lucky to be in it, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| I don't know that I'd move into it today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7949)|
| 2:12:32| because it's a high bar at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7952)|
| 2:12:38| that a lot of people from other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7958)|
| 2:12:40| that aren't as affordable as ours have moved into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7960)|
| 2:12:43| And at the same time, nobody's selling anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| because they can't afford to go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7965)|
| 2:12:48| And I've heard the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7968)|
| 2:12:49| where you have like 30 something people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7969)|
| 2:12:51| waiting lists for apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7971)|
| 2:12:54| So, if anybody thinks that we come by these decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7974)|
| 2:12:58| easily, we're deciding whether people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7978)|
| 2:13:00| have a house to live in or not by these zoning decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7980)|
| 2:13:03| And I bring up the plan development part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7983)|
| 2:13:07| and piggyback on what Mr. Smith brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7987)|
| 2:13:09| because you can say a lot of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| but there's no, that's the only tool we have left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7993)|
| 2:13:17| in our current zoning code to be able to lock in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7997)|
| 2:13:20| a commitment to what is to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8000)|
| 2:13:23| And that's the struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| And I completely respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8005)|
| 2:13:27| I mean, as they had mentioned before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8007)|
| 2:13:30| staff, I mean, it took what, two or three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8010)|
| 2:13:34| of back and forth between city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8014)|
| 2:13:36| and planning staff to nail down RECO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8016)|
| 2:13:40| and design all the different RN 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 up to seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8020)|
| 2:13:45| But by design in that RN 5 is designed that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8025)|
| 2:13:50| unfortunately, and so we don't have a real choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| to ask for it, you know, so, but it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| Right, RN 4 is really a small multiplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8037)|
| 2:13:58| And so RN 4 is apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8038)|
| 2:14:00| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8040)|
| 2:14:02| RN 5, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8042)|
| 2:14:03| And the numbers sound huge compared to our old one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8043)|
| 2:14:06| I think that's the art of ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8046)|
| 2:14:10| Okay, I think it was Testament Smith and Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8050)|
| 2:14:14| So we'll start with Council Member Testament and Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8054)|
| 2:14:18| Just a quick question for Mr. Welch in planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8058)|
| 2:14:22| Can you elaborate a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8062)|
| 2:14:23| based on your recommendation to RN 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8063)|
| 2:14:26| discuss a little bit more about the buffer zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| because this property does seem to meet the criteria of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8068)|
| 2:14:36| I'll defer to Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8076)|
| 2:14:37| She's got it up on her laptop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8077)|
| 2:14:38| but I can't read it from here, so go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8078)|
| 2:14:41| I'm sorry, could you elaborate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8081)|
| 2:14:42| on what you mean by buffer zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8082)|
| 2:14:44| Well, just that RN 5, or transitional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8084)|
| 2:14:46| a transition zone between single family and commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8086)|
| 2:14:50| If you could speak to that a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| in y'all's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| Okay, so under RN 5, multifamily is permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8093)|
| 2:14:59| as 5,000 square feet for the first two dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8099)|
| 2:15:05| and then 1,450 square feet per additional dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8105)|
| 2:15:11| There are limitations on height in RN 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8111)|
| 2:15:15| that helps keep the scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8115)|
| 2:15:17| at a more single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| That maximum building height has to be maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8119)|
| 2:15:22| at 35 feet under RN 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8122)|
| 2:15:28| And there are some additional setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8128)|
| 2:15:34| that would have to be met for multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8134)|
| 2:15:36| a little bit greater under RN 5 for multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8136)|
| 2:15:39| It's 15 feet, whereas if it were single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8139)|
| 2:15:42| it would be 12 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8142)|
| 2:15:46| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8146)|
| 2:15:47| That's it, just that it does, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8147)|
| 2:15:51| does transition from single family to commercial on the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8151)|
| 2:16:01| Yeah, I think we understand it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8161)|
| 2:16:03| Yeah, there's, the transitional zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8163)|
| 2:16:07| is trying to transition from streets and highways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8167)|
| 2:16:10| and other development there to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8170)|
| 2:16:13| And with the new zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8173)|
| 2:16:15| there are more buffers than there used to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8175)|
| 2:16:20| in the R2 zone five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8180)|
| 2:16:23| It was sort of like the Wild West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| And now there's a more size and look of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8185)|
| 2:16:30| versus just the number of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8190)|
| 2:16:32| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8192)|
| 2:16:34| Thank you, Council Member Smith and then Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8194)|
| 2:16:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8196)|
| 2:16:38| I actually think affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8198)|
| 2:16:41| higher density works in neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| as long as it's either replacing existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8203)|
| 2:16:46| dense development or there's a vacant land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8206)|
| 2:16:51| like this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8211)|
| 2:16:54| But I do have a hard time in this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8214)|
| 2:16:57| just to step from 30, 40 units to 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| Can you address that question one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| I heard building costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8223)|
| 2:17:06| but why not meet in the middle somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8226)|
| 2:17:11| Yeah, and truthfully, it's all a pro forma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| Honestly, it's not, these affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8234)|
| 2:17:19| to tax credit deals, it's not about making more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8239)|
| 2:17:22| or making less money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8242)|
| 2:17:24| Either it works or it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8244)|
| 2:17:25| It's yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8245)|
| 2:17:26| I mean, pro forma wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| when you turn this application into THDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8249)|
| 2:17:32| And I've run many, many, many pro formas on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8252)|
| 2:17:36| And it does have a break point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8256)|
| 2:17:40| 30, 40 units is nowhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8260)|
| 2:17:42| it's not even in the ballpark of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8262)|
| 2:17:45| Could it work with a little bit less than 120?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8265)|
| 2:17:48| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8268)|
| 2:17:49| I'm not trying to push the density up to make more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8269)|
| 2:17:52| It's just the feasibility of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8272)|
| 2:17:57| I could probably get it to work with close to 100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8277)|
| 2:18:02| on the pro forma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8282)|
| 2:18:04| But anything less than that, I think it gets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8284)|
| 2:18:07| it just crashes the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8287)|
| 2:18:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8288)|
| 2:18:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8289)|
| 2:18:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8290)|
| 2:18:11| Well, I want to thank the neighborhood particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8291)|
| 2:18:13| for not objecting to it being affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8293)|
| 2:18:20| as will be called middle class housing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8300)|
| 2:18:22| I think in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8302)|
| 2:18:24| So I think, thank you for not objecting to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8304)|
| 2:18:28| You may disagree on some other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8308)|
| 2:18:31| but I particularly think that's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8311)|
| 2:18:35| that that not be a factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8315)|
| 2:18:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| Mr. Huber, just a couple of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| before you sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8327)|
| 2:18:50| Just for clarification, you're not the owner of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8330)|
| 2:18:53| now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8333)|
| 2:18:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8334)|
| 2:18:54| It's under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8334)|
| 2:18:55| It's under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8335)|
| 2:18:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8339)|
| 2:18:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8339)|
| 2:19:01| And who's the present owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8341)|
| 2:19:04| The present owner, his name is Quint Bourgeois.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8344)|
| 2:19:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8347)|
| 2:19:08| And how long is he on the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8348)|
| 2:19:09| Oh, gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| I couldn't tell you that exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8351)|
| 2:19:13| It's probably early 2000s, I would guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8353)|
| 2:19:16| And the building of the sidewalks that we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8356)|
| 2:19:20| along the front of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8360)|
| 2:19:22| that would be something you would be required to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8362)|
| 2:19:24| regardless, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8364)|
| 2:19:25| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8365)|
| 2:19:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8366)|
| 2:19:28| Or zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8368)|
| 2:19:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8370)|
| 2:19:31| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8371)|
| 2:19:34| Question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8374)|
| 2:19:38| We just, as my colleague and I have talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8378)|
| 2:19:41| transitional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8381)|
| 2:19:48| You could speak into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8388)|
| 2:19:50| You really have to get close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8390)|
| 2:19:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8394)|
| 2:19:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8395)|
| 2:19:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8397)|
| 2:19:59| But the area of the proposed property development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8399)|
| 2:20:07| the property that's proposed to be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| I should say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8409)|
| 2:20:12| does not connect with the commercial node| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8412)|
| 2:20:17| that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8417)|
| 2:20:18| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8418)|
| 2:20:20| Right, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8420)|
| 2:20:21| It is not adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8421)|
| 2:20:22| It is their separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8422)|
| 2:20:23| In fact, in between that are single family residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8423)|
| 2:20:30| zoned, I think, R1, RM1, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| So the transition that based a lot of this on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8434)|
| 2:20:40| doesn't really, I guess, meet my criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8440)|
| 2:20:46| transitioning from the commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8446)|
| 2:20:49| to all the single family residences to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8449)|
| 2:20:54| because in fact, it doesn't connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8454)|
| 2:20:57| with a commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8459)|
| 2:21:00| There's one lot separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8460)|
| 2:21:02| between the commercial neighborhood zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8462)|
| 2:21:06| and then there's one of those single family homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| is the zoned CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8468)|
| 2:21:10| Yeah, so there's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8470)|
| 2:21:11| Two single family units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| One is zoned CN and one is zoned R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8473)|
| 2:21:19| Just a brief comment about what's our charge here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8479)|
| 2:21:24| And I respect some of the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8484)|
| 2:21:26| that have been made about respecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8486)|
| 2:21:32| the positions of the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8492)|
| 2:21:36| respecting the positions of the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8496)|
| 2:21:41| And that is something that I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8501)|
| 2:21:44| and quite often base a lot of my competence on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8504)|
| 2:21:50| But there's a reason why we are here to review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8510)|
| 2:21:57| And one of the reasons is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8517)|
| 2:21:58| is sometimes at the planning commission level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8518)|
| 2:22:02| the neighbors aren't aware, they're not organized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8522)|
| 2:22:05| they're not presenting the cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8525)|
| 2:22:07| like they do with their city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8527)|
| 2:22:10| So it wouldn't be a dismissal of your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8530)|
| 2:22:16| And then I can speak from personal experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8536)|
| 2:22:20| There have been times when I agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8540)|
| 2:22:23| with the planning commission's position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8543)|
| 2:22:25| and the majority of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8545)|
| 2:22:29| So we have to weigh every situation completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8549)|
| 2:22:34| And so there's a reason why we get a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8554)|
| 2:22:42| A lot of it is said sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8562)|
| 2:22:45| we don't get the full picture at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8565)|
| 2:22:48| So that's one reason for us to kind of review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8568)|
| 2:22:58| We all know there's a demand for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8578)|
| 2:23:01| It's been described as desperate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8581)|
| 2:23:04| This, I think, would be desperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8584)|
| 2:23:08| I don't think we should be so desperate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8588)|
| 2:23:09| that we build anything, anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8589)|
| 2:23:14| at the expense of established neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8594)|
| 2:23:18| Most of the people who live in apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| someday want to live in single family neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8601)|
| 2:23:26| We need to protect those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8606)|
| 2:23:29| And there are certain areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8609)|
| 2:23:31| where not only should we protect them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8611)|
| 2:23:34| but we want to give the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8614)|
| 2:23:35| for a single family neighborhood to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8615)|
| 2:23:40| so that we will have more of a housing stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8620)|
| 2:23:42| for single family neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8622)|
| 2:23:44| So we have to balance this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8624)|
| 2:23:47| We can't use this strong, strong need for housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8627)|
| 2:23:52| which I have, my record shows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8632)|
| 2:23:56| I have really tried to fight that fight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8636)|
| 2:23:59| and do what we can to get affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8639)|
| 2:24:01| get more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8643)|
| 2:24:05| But the price, if we're not careful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8645)|
| 2:24:06| we're gonna pay is diminishing existing neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8646)|
| 2:24:11| not giving existing neighborhoods a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8651)|
| 2:24:15| to grow out in their housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8655)|
| 2:24:18| So we have to be very, very selective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8658)|
| 2:24:21| in what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8661)|
| 2:24:24| And the neighborhood is not opposed to increased density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8664)|
| 2:24:30| But it doesn't want to be overwhelmed in such a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8670)|
| 2:24:33| that it actually damages the fabric of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8673)|
| 2:24:37| When you start doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8677)|
| 2:24:39| you start getting into other problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8679)|
| 2:24:42| that aren't necessarily so easily to quantify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8682)|
| 2:24:47| put into numbers, put on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| You get into alienation in urban environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8690)|
| 2:24:56| You get into road rage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8696)|
| 2:24:58| You get into all kinds of mental health issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8698)|
| 2:25:04| of varying degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8704)|
| 2:25:07| And these are real things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8707)|
| 2:25:11| And we just need to be mindful in our fight and challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8711)|
| 2:25:17| that I have been completely on board with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8717)|
| 2:25:19| to provide more and more and more housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8719)|
| 2:25:22| for people in Knoxville, particularly do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8722)|
| 2:25:24| We don't need to throw the baby out with the bathwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8724)|
| 2:25:29| These folks, people in these existing neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8729)|
| 2:25:33| they've invested there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8733)|
| 2:25:35| They're not like flipping houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8735)|
| 2:25:38| This is their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8738)|
| 2:25:40| And we owe them as well as convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8740)|
| 2:25:48| And I understand development and the need for development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8748)|
| 2:25:54| but we're in a situation where do we do what we're gonna do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8754)|
| 2:26:00| at the convenience of a particular developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8760)|
| 2:26:04| or do we have a little more patience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8764)|
| 2:26:07| or show a little bit more study of other options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8767)|
| 2:26:14| that would actually do both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8774)|
| 2:26:16| increase housing and protect existing neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8776)|
| 2:26:24| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8784)|
| 2:26:25| Thank you, Council Member Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| Council Member Parker, then Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8787)|
| 2:26:30| I just wanted to say quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8790)|
| 2:26:32| kind of in response to some of those comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8792)|
| 2:26:34| but what is the threat to a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8794)|
| 2:26:39| when multifamily housing comes in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8799)|
| 2:26:42| I think that the way of the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8802)|
| 2:26:45| is that residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| will be for all types of residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8807)|
| 2:26:50| I think that the future of zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8810)|
| 2:26:53| will see only allowing multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8813)|
| 2:26:59| in certain parts of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8819)|
| 2:27:00| and single family and others as discriminatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8820)|
| 2:27:05| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| Now, these are the zoning laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8827)|
| 2:27:09| that we're working within at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| so I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| But I just had to challenge the notion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8833)|
| 2:27:16| that multifamily housing threatens neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8836)|
| 2:27:21| with predominantly single family housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8841)|
| 2:27:25| I'm in support of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| I do remember the project at Pine Gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8847)|
| 2:27:29| and my memory of it is that there was significant work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8849)|
| 2:27:36| done to Hollywood Road before that project went in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8856)|
| 2:27:39| And so we have to take into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8859)|
| 2:27:42| the infrastructure needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8862)|
| 2:27:43| regardless of what housing we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8863)|
| 2:27:46| We have to make sure that the public infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8866)|
| 2:27:48| is there that is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8868)|
| 2:27:50| So that's my concern for this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8870)|
| 2:27:53| and my commitment to ensuring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8873)|
| 2:27:56| that those investments do come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8876)|
| 2:28:00| But in terms of the housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8880)|
| 2:28:07| I'm not capable of seeing multifamily housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8887)|
| 2:28:09| as a threat to single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| So that's all I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8891)|
| 2:28:13| Thank you, Council Member Parker, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8893)|
| 2:28:17| Yeah, I was just gonna make a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8897)|
| 2:28:18| and call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8898)|
| 2:28:20| We've been talking around and dancing around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8900)|
| 2:28:22| what the map says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8902)|
| 2:28:23| and I'm gonna support the motion that's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8903)|
| 2:28:28| This is a large parcel of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8908)|
| 2:28:30| that borders a solid and stable neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8910)|
| 2:28:33| And there's one house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8913)|
| 2:28:36| and I'm not saying the one house doesn't count,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8916)|
| 2:28:38| but the parcel of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8918)|
| 2:28:39| is sandwiched between medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8919)|
| 2:28:44| in both directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8924)|
| 2:28:46| I will say, Mr. Huber, if this fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| I would be much more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8928)|
| 2:28:49| with some kind of plan, development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8929)|
| 2:28:52| where you nail it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8932)|
| 2:28:54| and people can see what it is you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8934)|
| 2:28:59| But in conversation with you for the THEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8939)|
| 2:29:02| I said that correctly, dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8942)|
| 2:29:04| is a timeframe, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8944)|
| 2:29:06| It's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8946)|
| 2:29:08| And we're at a point where materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| aren't affordable to build things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8950)|
| 2:29:12| but we're in a position where we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8952)|
| 2:29:13| 38 deep waiting lists for apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8953)|
| 2:29:17| and zero houses and 30 people in bidding wars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8957)|
| 2:29:20| and the only people that can buy them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8960)|
| 2:29:21| are people with cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8961)|
| 2:29:22| And there aren't too many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8962)|
| 2:29:23| with 300 to $700,000 cash to buy a house right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8963)|
| 2:29:27| And that's just our market right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8967)|
| 2:29:29| You don't have cash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8969)|
| 2:29:30| hundreds of thousands of dollars of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| you can barely buy a place to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8972)|
| 2:29:33| even though we all wanna be in a single family house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8973)|
| 2:29:36| Many of us are in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8976)|
| 2:29:38| So I have a hard time saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8978)|
| 2:29:40| that this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8980)|
| 2:29:41| sandwiched between medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8981)|
| 2:29:44| And I guess the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8984)|
| 2:29:45| I just wanna answer real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| is what do people see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8987)|
| 2:29:48| as the threat of single family housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8988)|
| 2:29:51| In the past, we had very low standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8991)|
| 2:29:53| to no standards for how it was laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8993)|
| 2:29:55| And if you look at many of these older apartment complexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8995)|
| 2:29:58| that were built in the 60s and 70s and the 80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=8998)|
| 2:30:01| and if you look at Inskip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9001)|
| 2:30:02| I give it to you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9002)|
| 2:30:04| you guys are laid up with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9004)|
| 2:30:05| it's everywhere, it's all over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9005)|
| 2:30:06| it's in the medium middles of your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9006)|
| 2:30:09| There were no standards for where the dumpsters go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9009)|
| 2:30:11| When you go to my district in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9011)|
| 2:30:14| on some of the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9014)|
| 2:30:15| where they've taken chunks of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9015)|
| 2:30:17| at the end of the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9017)|
| 2:30:18| and shoved in some of these apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9018)|
| 2:30:19| it says, welcome to the dumpster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9019)|
| 2:30:21| also known as my street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| But we can't tell these people to lay out the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9023)|
| 2:30:26| But now we have a zoning code that tells you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9026)|
| 2:30:29| you cannot put your dumpster like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9029)|
| 2:30:31| You cannot lay out your parking lot like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9031)|
| 2:30:33| You have to screen things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9033)|
| 2:30:34| you have to put trees in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9034)|
| 2:30:35| you have to put a sidewalk in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9035)|
| 2:30:38| I feel more comfortable with plan development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9038)|
| 2:30:40| because I can see that you're gonna spell it out for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9040)|
| 2:30:44| But that's also a hurdle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9044)|
| 2:30:45| And you have to do public amenities to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9045)|
| 2:30:48| So I'm gonna support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9048)|
| 2:30:51| I'm gonna call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9051)|
| 2:30:52| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9052)|
| 2:30:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9054)|
| 2:30:56| We vote on calling for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9056)|
| 2:30:59| Is there a second on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9059)|
| 2:31:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9061)|

| 2:31:18| I think we're gonna need to do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9078)|
| 2:31:19| Mr. Johnson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9079)|
| 2:31:20| Last Mayor Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9080)|

| 2:31:59| of hopeful housing Cubert Properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9119)|
| 2:32:02| for a one-year plan image from low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9122)|
| 2:32:05| to medium-density residential office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9125)|
| 2:32:07| for a property located at 4207, 4201, 4123,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9127)|
| 2:32:11| and Zero Bruin Road, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9131)|
| 2:32:15| Motion made to approve and second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9135)|
| 2:32:17| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9137)|
| 2:32:19| Councilmember Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9139)|
| 2:32:20| Yeah, I just wanted to review the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9140)|
| 2:32:24| of the staff discharge will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9144)|
| 2:32:29| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9149)|
| 2:32:35| Let me, well, let me just ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9155)|
| 2:32:37| What was the criteria that you used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9157)|
| 2:32:40| to recommend the one-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9160)|
| 2:32:47| Ms. Albertson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9167)|
| 2:32:49| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9169)|
| 2:32:51| So there are multiple criteria that we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9171)|
| 2:32:54| for the one-year plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9174)|
| 2:32:56| and it may meet any one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9176)|
| 2:32:59| That includes an error in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9179)|
| 2:33:01| Staff noted that this area could have been considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9181)|
| 2:33:05| in the sector plan update for this area as MDRO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9185)|
| 2:33:09| because it meets the location criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9189)|
| 2:33:11| for that land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9191)|
| 2:33:13| It's near a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9193)|
| 2:33:15| It is a transitional area between commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9195)|
| 2:33:18| low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9198)|
| 2:33:19| and other medium-density residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9199)|
| 2:33:22| The site is less than 15% in slope generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9202)|
| 2:33:28| and it is along a corridor, near a corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9208)|
| 2:33:31| that is served by transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9211)|
| 2:33:34| And staff also noted that there was a significant change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9214)|
| 2:33:40| in some, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9220)|
| 2:33:47| Sorry, there has been no change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9227)|
| 2:33:48| in public policy necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9228)|
| 2:33:51| but it is within 500 feet of a transit line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9231)|
| 2:33:55| for medium-density residential and office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9235)|
| 2:33:58| so that provides additional opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9238)|
| 2:34:01| for residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9241)|
| 2:34:02| within a walkable distance to transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9242)|
| 2:34:07| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9247)|
| 2:34:08| Staff also noted that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9248)|
| 2:34:12| this is a transitional area between the commercial node| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9252)|
| 2:34:15| at Dutch Valley Drive and Bruin Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9255)|
| 2:34:22| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9262)|
| 2:34:23| I just wanted to kind of review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9263)|
| 2:34:29| This was based on an error in a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9269)|
| 2:34:36| by the criteria that was used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9276)|
| 2:34:38| that the MDR could have been considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9278)|
| 2:34:44| Do we know that it wasn't considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9284)|
| 2:34:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9287)|
| 2:34:51| I will say that that was before my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9291)|
| 2:34:53| That was in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9293)|
| 2:34:57| So, the error is that they could have considered this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9297)|
| 2:35:04| We can't prove that they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9304)|
| 2:35:07| And to say that that was an error in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9307)|
| 2:35:12| maybe they didn't make an error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9312)|
| 2:35:13| Maybe they thought it out very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9313)|
| 2:35:15| like the planning staff had planned to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9315)|
| 2:35:20| And so, just to hang the hat on the criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9320)|
| 2:35:26| maybe they didn't make an error in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9326)|
| 2:35:32| Yes, it's good to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9332)|
| 2:35:35| It's not a kind of error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9335)|
| 2:35:40| that, in my mind, justifies meeting that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9340)|
| 2:35:46| And then, we don't think they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9346)|
| 2:35:48| It says, some of the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9348)|
| 2:35:51| is significant infrastructure changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9351)|
| 2:35:56| It says there's no significant infrastructure changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9356)|
| 2:36:03| One is a change in public policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9363)|
| 2:36:05| but it says no change in public policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9365)|
| 2:36:10| Another criteria is new information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9370)|
| 2:36:13| And no new information is coming out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9373)|
| 2:36:17| There's new information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9377)|
| 2:36:22| Those movements have just changed conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9382)|
| 2:36:34| We talked some about the condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9394)|
| 2:36:37| It's not ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9397)|
| 2:36:39| It's as small as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9399)|
| 2:36:42| It's between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9402)|
| 2:36:43| It's not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9403)|
| 2:36:49| how do you do business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9409)|
| 2:36:54| So, I think the criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9414)|
| 2:37:03| maybe they didn't make an error in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9423)|
| 2:37:07| It's good to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9427)|
| 2:37:12| It's not a kind of error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9432)|
| 2:37:14| It's not a kind of change that we can just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9434)|
| 2:37:29| I agree, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9449)|
| 2:37:37| I would argue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9457)|
| 2:37:38| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9458)|

| 2:37:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9468)|
| 2:37:49| I'm going to vote no on this because I do think that there's an argument to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9469)|
| 2:37:56| that we need more housing and we need more density, but I think particularly when you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9476)|
| 2:38:00| making such a big jump from RN1 to RN5, it's a perfect scenario for planned development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9480)|
| 2:38:06| and I realize you're up against a deadline, but that's not something that this body's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9486)|
| 2:38:11| restricted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9491)|
| 2:38:12| So I'd encourage you to utilize that tool, if at all possible, to accommodate the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9492)|
| 2:38:20| one step closer to what it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9500)|

| 2:38:52| And I would like to make a motion to amend, to simply amend from RN5 to RN2 for all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9532)|
| 2:39:01| reasons that we've debated and expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9541)|
| 2:39:05| Okay, is there a second to the proposed amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9545)|
| 2:39:10| Mayor, before I make a motion, I would ask Mr. Huber, would you be willing to move from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9550)|
| 2:39:18| RN5 to RN2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9558)|
| 2:39:22| I don't think it's a matter of if I can, it's can I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9562)|
| 2:39:26| The project does not work, period, in RN2, or RN3 or RN4, it only works in RN5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9566)|
| 2:39:36| What I would like to do is be able to second my colleague's motion, but since the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9576)|
| 2:39:42| owner and developer who's here talking says that he can't, he wouldn't agree to do an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9582)|
| 2:39:48| amendment to the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9588)|
| 2:39:50| Okay, there's no second to your motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9590)|
| 2:39:54| So the motion to amend is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9594)|
| 2:39:57| You have, I'm sorry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9597)|
| 2:40:03| I understand Mr. Huber's position, but the charge here is to not make those decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9603)|
| 2:40:12| on the convenience of the developer, but to what's only good for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9612)|
| 2:40:19| So I would make that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9619)|
| 2:40:22| The other, and this will be a request to both of the parties who've already met, regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9622)|
| 2:40:29| of how this vote goes, this is a first reading, and so it takes two readings for it to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9629)|
| 2:40:40| decided on, and I had been my hope that we could have worked this out, and it's still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9640)|
| 2:40:49| my hope that we can find some common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9649)|
| 2:40:55| So just a simple question, Mr. Huber, would you be willing to continue to talk to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9655)|
| 2:41:01| neighbors and see, address their concerns and see if there's some common ground between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9661)|
| 2:41:05| now and the vote in two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9665)|
| 2:41:08| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9668)|
| 2:41:09| I'm always open for any way to fulfill the need for the housing and keep the impact as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9669)|
| 2:41:15| little as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9675)|

| 2:43:30| But I am an alumnus of Knoxville College, class of 1994.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9810)|
| 2:43:34| So 30 years later, in a sense, I'm asked to revitalize this campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9814)|
| 2:43:39| My background is I'm a real estate developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9819)|
| 2:43:42| I just did not want to bring that up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9822)|
| 2:43:45| But our goal is to develop and be an inclusive space at Knoxville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9825)|
| 2:43:51| We have carved the college up into four sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9831)|
| 2:43:54| We are looking at ways to be inclusive and have shorter pathways to careers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9834)|
| 2:44:01| Our front section we are looking at to remain our collegiate front, our fourth sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9841)|
| 2:44:06| which is where we're proposing this affordable housing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9846)|
| 2:44:09| In the middle, we're looking for outdoor classrooms and outdoor living room spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9849)|
| 2:44:15| to include potentially a partnership with TCAD of bringing some of those trades over to Knoxville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9855)|
| 2:44:22| So we have a lot before us at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9862)|
| 2:44:25| Again, I want to just thank this body for, in a sense, allowing Knoxville College to be who we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9865)|
| 2:44:32| But that's not what we're going to be going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9872)|
| 2:44:35| This is an opportunity for us to invest into this campus of 58 acres to ask for you all to approve 11 acres under this approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9875)|
| 2:44:48| We are also going for the tax credit program, which you all just discussed very robustly with the same state organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9888)|
| 2:44:56| So it is a very much a need for affordability and affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9896)|
| 2:45:01| We believe this is a solution for the Mechanicsville community and bringing more density to the area so that we can bring some more of the economics as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9901)|
| 2:45:11| Thank you, President Adams. And I also want to thank you and the administration for hosting an additional community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9911)|
| 2:45:17| In addition to the ones that you already had to give other people an opportunity to come out, hear the vision, see it and ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9917)|
| 2:45:25| What I really love about this proposal is the walkability for children to be able to go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9925)|
| 2:45:31| And also that it also is next door to already an existing affordable housing community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9931)|
| 2:45:40| And so very good feedback from the community so far. We're looking forward to to having this affordable housing and families and more vibrancy and life in the surgeon of education and also hopefully trades in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9940)|
| 2:45:56| And that's for college. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Adams and Councilmember McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9956)|
| 2:46:03| Mayor. And thank you, Mr. Adams. I apologize. I was not able to join you all last Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9963)|
| 2:46:12| My sister got married. But on the way to the wedding, I got to listen in on the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9972)|
| 2:46:20| I appreciate y'all putting it on Facebook so that I could follow along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9980)|
| 2:46:25| Y'all got your hands full. Yes, we do. A lot of work, but a lot of work is happening at Knoxville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9985)|
| 2:46:32| And I mean, I'm excited about all of it. And that's not usually the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9992)|
| 2:46:39| So I know y'all have a lot of work ahead. I'm in support of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=9999)|
| 2:46:44| Y'all do know right here on Iredale is the tiny home village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10004)|
| 2:46:49| But this is, you know, understand that you're a fan of the tiny homes and we can talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10009)|
| 2:46:56| Yes. Thank you. Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10016)|

| 2:47:58| Seeing none. All those in favor, please say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries. Council members, we have three people signed up to speak at public forum. First person is Michael Rinkle. Mr. Rinkle, you could come to the podium. State your name and address for the record and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10078)|
| 2:48:26| Thank you, Mayor and City Council. My name is Michael Jennings Rinkle. I came as a constituent of Knoxville, born and raised here, had a father, was a parent. We're talking a lot about housing, affordable housing. It hit on tonight a couple of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10106)|
| 2:48:54| And, you know, obviously we have a housing problem. I'm out on the streets every single day and have been for six years as a constituent for the homeless, drug addicted. I target and find children, underage children, because we have no safety net, none in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10134)|
| 2:49:16| I'm from the Grand Nines, the Knights of Columbus. My first order of business is orphans, widows, and children. And I'm sworn to this. I was technically almost an orphan. My sister was. Westmoreland. Grew up in Westmoreland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10156)|
| 2:49:35| Capital High School. Graduate. Went to UT. We've got a real problem in this city. And it's not just housing. Obviously, it's hard. I know it's hard on you all. It's hard on the different agencies involved. The ones that obviously, you know, fight over grants. I don't have time for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10175)|
| 2:50:02| I'm the guy that literally walks the greenways and the railroad tracks as a constituent, as a father. I've raised children and I've found people. I've found frozen bodies. I've found dead people. I've found children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10202)|
| 2:50:19| Today, luckily our KPD and their investigators are investigating right now. 14, 15, young girl. She's in UT hospital right now. You know, they're checking everything out. God bless the police officers. But we have no safety. We have no place to take not just the homeless, but I'm talking kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10219)|
| 2:50:47| Okay. Our, luckily, different agencies, they've called what? Youth. We've expanded youth programs to 25. I'm very glad for that. 25 is a magical number. 25 years ago, I helped write free children's rights laws, which are law across the country right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10247)|
| 2:51:07| Okay. And I'm being called up and I'm talking to legislators on a state level and a national level because I see a breakdown. And when Ms. Parker brought up the homeless forums and roundtables, we don't know about it. I love the job. I hold a lot of information. I've got two of the young people right here. They're adults now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10267)|
| 2:51:30| One of them, 17-year-old sister, I got him out. And the next day, trying to get his sister when I found out a 17-year-old girl was out there, she was dead. Okay. This boy's hurting. We have to answer for this. His parents, his constituents, his town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10290)|
| 2:51:50| There's problems here. And we're throwing money like Band-Aids to fix it. These agencies, they literally have called me to train their people that they hire to be boots on the ground. You're looking at boots on the ground. They all lower their head when I show up. They know who's on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10310)|
| 2:52:13| They want me to teach them. I'm not trained. I'm trained by the streets now. I immersed myself in this. I quit my full-time job. I kicked my retirement in on this. Ms. Parker mentioned I've got one of my best friends, Mr. Grimes, right here. He runs an outreach on a disability check because what happened to his own son five years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10333)|
| 2:52:43| But we don't hear about any help for any of us. We're not in it for the money. That's not why we're out here. I love my city. It's a great town. But we've got breakdowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10363)|
| 2:52:58| I came right out of the corporate world. I was the guy who'd send in to municipalities to get information. I was a secret weapon. That's what I did. So I can transition this knowledge into what I'm doing right now. I go gaining intent. I've got a ton of intent that I could help with, but nobody's ever asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10378)|
| 2:53:29| We are doing this. We're doing this very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10409)|
| 2:53:31| Mr. Rinkle, that concludes your five minutes. I forgot to ask you for your address for the record. If you could share your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10411)|
| 2:53:37| 10312 Old Road, Dwight. I'm an Ops Captain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10417)|
| 2:53:43| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10423)|
| 2:53:44| Yes, absolutely. And I just want to make the council aware. You all are, you know, we voted you in. I'm at the station. It's our tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10424)|
| 2:53:57| Thank you, Mr. Rinkle. We've got another person signed up to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10437)|
| 2:54:02| Thank you. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10442)|
| 2:54:04| The next person is Chris Ulmer. Mr. Ulmer, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10444)|
| 2:54:14| My name is Chris Ulmer. My address is 4629 Newcomb Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10454)|
| 2:54:28| In the process of meeting these cool people, Mike Rinkle and Chip Grimes, becoming good friends with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10468)|
| 2:54:37| One thing that you all need to know is that, and I'm a business owner myself, and I speak with other business owners, and some of them are in the thrift store industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10477)|
| 2:54:50| All of these people have told me that when it comes to the main homeless shelters, when you see these thrift stores around, it's really making bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10490)|
| 2:55:03| big bank for the owners of those main homeless shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10503)|
| 2:55:08| That's because the number one expense with the business is the cost of goods sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10508)|
| 2:55:15| At least if, you know, maybe beyond human resources, but it's the cost of goods sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10515)|
| 2:55:22| All that stuff is being donated to these homeless shelters. They turn around and make bank on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10522)|
| 2:55:28| Now, I watched earlier today, and I voted for most of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10528)|
| 2:55:34| Some of you were not on the ballot when I voted, but you guys voted to give the money funding to these places where it's basically running a scam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10534)|
| 2:55:46| Most of the money that is going is going to line the pockets of the owners of those homeless shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10546)|
| 2:55:54| You all know which ones I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10554)|
| 2:55:59| Martin Luther King said that the greatest enemy was neoliberalism, the paradigm of neoliberalism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10559)|
| 2:56:10| He referred to it as the fox in the henhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10570)|
| 2:56:14| That's because it comes as the unnoticed killer through virtue signaling and claiming to stand for change while doing nothing more than maintaining the status quo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10574)|
| 2:56:24| which has been so destructive to so many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10584)|
| 2:56:28| India, India Kincannon, earlier tonight, we had a great question by Councilwoman Parker about what we need to do different things, and we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10588)|
| 2:56:43| And you replied, I'll be honest with you, you replied in, I think, a very disgusting way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10603)|
| 2:56:51| I voted for you. I voted for you because I believe in you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10611)|
| 2:56:55| You said, basically, to paraphrase, you said we're doing plenty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10615)|
| 2:57:00| The real answer to that is no, we're actually not doing plenty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10620)|
| 2:57:04| We're maintaining the status quo that's being so destructive to so many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10624)|
| 2:57:10| There is an 8,000-pound elephant in the room that you all may not be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10630)|
| 2:57:15| If you want to go to YouTube, you can watch a 15-minute video called Humans Need Not Apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10635)|
| 2:57:20| In the midst of all of this talk about affordable housing, what's actually going on is something called technological unemployment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10640)|
| 2:57:32| Jobs are being replaced at a rapid, accelerating rate, and especially when it comes to the manufacturing industry, the blue-collar field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10652)|
| 2:57:42| There are jobs for those people, but they're working at convenience stores and restaurants where they don't even pay them a living wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10662)|
| 2:57:51| Now, Tommy Smith, you talked about how we are, you were concerned about how we need to take this in incremental steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10671)|
| 2:58:00| This may not be something you want to hear, but get ready because, as science will prove, it's only going to come hard, and it's only going to come harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10680)|
| 2:58:13| We're going to see a whole lot more people that are going to be in desperate need of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10693)|
| 2:58:18| I say this also to support law enforcement because police lives actually do matter also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10698)|
| 2:58:25| I've had to explain to some people on the left that, and I think some of them are coming around, you guys are going to be facing that pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10705)|
| 2:58:34| That's what happens when it's something called relative poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10714)|
| 2:58:39| The growing difference between the haves and the have-nots and the more discrepancy you get, that is something tracked through social science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10719)|
| 2:58:49| which always means higher rates of violence, drug addiction, suicide, all of those bad things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10729)|
| 2:58:58| We're going to have to evolve, and there is no escape from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10738)|
| 2:59:03| I guarantee you all, marked by these words, this is not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10743)|
| 2:59:08| It's only going to become more and more accelerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10748)|
| 2:59:11| I'd like to close one with a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10751)|
| 2:59:15| Look at the state of Utah, what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10755)|
| 2:59:18| They're just simply giving houses to homeless people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10758)|
| 2:59:21| What they found is a 91% reduction in homeless rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10761)|
| 2:59:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10765)|
| 2:59:26| Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10766)|
| 2:59:27| Next is Chip Grimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10767)|
| 2:59:29| Mr. Grimes, please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10769)|
| 2:59:32| You do not wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10772)|
| 2:59:33| Council Member, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10773)|
| 2:59:35| This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=10775)|
