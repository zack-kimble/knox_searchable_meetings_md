| 0:04:27| folks had their records expunged and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=267)|

| 0:12:42| I think she's very anxious to get the second phase going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| Yes, this is an exciting project, and I want to thank Mr. Hagerman for speaking with me about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=765)|

| 0:12:57| The contract amendment is really giving us a lot more than the original contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| included, and we're still within budget. Could you talk just a little bit about that? Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=782)|
| 0:13:09| The original concept for the project was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| carry some of the landscape, some of the look of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| the big Cumberland project farther west, so it included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| updating this the signal appearance and the lighting. At first, we... Farther east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=804)|
| 0:13:31| Farther towards downtown. Right. East, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=811)|
| 0:13:41| Yes, farther east, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| at first we didn't think that we could afford to do all of it because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| lights can be expensive, getting the power to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| the signals themselves were going to cost a lot, but we did a couple of things to lower that cost, and UT did one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| to lower the cost, so we ended up being able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| eventually get it all into that original budget so that we have we have the signals and we have the overhead lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=844)|
| 0:14:12| And again, as he alluded to, this this project is being split with the cost, split with UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| Councilman Wallace. That was my point, Jim, just that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| UT's on the hook for up to a million dollars, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| Right. And our part was also up to a million, so we're still with this with this additional funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=866)|

| 0:16:07| Mr. Hagerman, could you just comment on two things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| Number one, this one's a little unusual in that it's spread out over two different companies that bid on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| We do that occasionally where we will either have –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=980)|
| 0:16:27| What's the advantage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Well, the advantage is that we have greater capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| If, for example, we get a poll knocked down and one of those – I mean they're both small companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=991)|
| 0:16:38| One of the companies may not be able to respond quickly and the other one is more likely, if we have two, that we'll get a quick response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=998)|
| 0:16:48| The other is that they just have complementary skills and total greater amount of capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=1008)|
| 0:16:55| Again, they're two small companies, so if we have a lot of projects going on at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| we may not have one by itself may not be able to do that very quickly, and we've had that problem in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| Okay, and then secondly, this is going to help that signalization project that we've been talking about for several years move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=1026)|
| 0:17:15| They're getting the fiber in the ground with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| No, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| No, we're not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| We're not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| That is really tied down in TDOT processes, so we have to get past some of those hurdles before we go to construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=1041)|
| 0:17:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191008?start=1055)|
