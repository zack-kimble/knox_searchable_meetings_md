| 0:00:52| Thank you, do we have a representative for Hannah's here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=52)|
| 0:01:03| Okay, would you state your names please for the record and your address my name is Mike Nacio's I'm an attorney I represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=63)|
| 0:01:10| Rafiq Hanna the license is in mr. Hanna's name and he's the owner of Hanna's restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=70)|
| 0:01:16| I live that 8105 Ainsworth Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee. Okay. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=76)|
| 0:01:22| The reason that we are having this hearing is that based on the new state statute and your ABC hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=82)|
| 0:01:29| You've been directed to come before the beer board to show cause why you should not go before a hearing office for a revocation hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=89)|
| 0:01:38| Do you have anything you want to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=98)|
| 0:01:41| well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=101)|
| 0:01:44| We don't think that the new law applies to us in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=104)|
| 0:01:49| The alleged violations all occurred before the statute came into effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=109)|
| 0:01:55| Statue came into effect either. I'm not very clear either May the 9th of July 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=115)|
| 0:02:00| I'm not sure when it took effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| the violations that were alleged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| That resulted in us voluntarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=127)|
| 0:02:11| Giving up the license before eight five days occurred in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| 2010 and 2011 and I think one in 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| So the law was not in effect. That's and and we would further ask that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=141)|
| 0:02:28| This hearing be I guess postponed the city of Knoxville has filed a complaint on the same grounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=148)|
| 0:02:37| Attempting to revoke the license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| Revoke the license and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| We're going to end up in the same place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| And I I would ask that we hold it's going to do the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| ultimately, I would ask that under this new law being that it is new and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=171)|
| 0:02:57| that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=177)|
| 0:02:59| That that the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| called off in prosecuting the case and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| Essentially wait to see what the city of Knoxville will do with the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| I'm here to tell you also that during the suspension of the liquor license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| With the restaurant has been closed. In other words, we sold no beer license during that same period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=196)|
| 0:03:23| And we have I have mr. Hanna here to explain to the board all the steps he has taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=203)|
| 0:03:31| To make sure whatever violations occurred before will not occur in the future while especially pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=211)|
| 0:03:38| The the hearing on the complaint by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| So I would my first position is one the law doesn't apply to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| Second position is I guess we were asked that you put it off until we can have a full hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| On the matter before on the complaint by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| And third we've already been punished with in fact, we've punished ourselves at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| We didn't sell any any beer for 45 days. And in fact that suspension is expires today and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=241)|
| 0:04:09| So this is our position. I do if you don't want to put it off. I do have mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| Hanna here to put some proof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| I did want to make my positions on my position on the record in case I don't want to waive anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| I hate to keep everybody here, but I didn't want to waive anything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| May come back to affect us at the hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| We do the city has filed a complaint and there is a pre-conference hearing scheduled later this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| And so do I hear a motion from this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| vice mayor Pavlis, I believe this is in your district to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| Defer this to the city's complaint at this time. I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| I wonder if we could ask counsel if if that arrangement would be satisfactory to what she is pursuing from her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=289)|
| 0:04:58| Complain actually does not mention the ABC revocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| It mentioned several of the violations that did occur and that were the subject of the ABC revic our suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=301)|
| 0:05:08| But we didn't in fact refer to the ABC suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| But but substantively you're addressing the the service to minor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| Violations themselves the service to minor violations that you all discussed at last meeting were the basis for our suspension complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| And and so that will go on to a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| We will have a pre-scheduling conference next week with the hearing officer. And should that be necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| We will have a hearing I will point out under the statute that went into effect May 9th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| You are required the beer board shall schedule a hearing and we have done so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| We've been we've received certified notice from the ABC. So I think the city's position and and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=344)|
| 0:05:51| Mr. Frost represents you all but the city's position with regard to this statute is that you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=351)|
| 0:06:07| It on to a hearing under this language of the statute there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=367)|
| 0:06:24| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| The stat mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| Nauseous mentions that he doesn't believe the statute applies to him because the violation it's occurred prior to the statute going into effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| the statute language is silent as to when the violations occurred the triggering language is when the ABC takes a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=393)|
| 0:06:41| Suspension or revocation action that action occurred post the effective date of this statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| so but but theoretically at least if we're going to get at the substance we can vote to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| Do it all at once in your hearing. Is that fair? You could vote to send this to a hearing what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| Substantively and practically I will do is amend the complaint that based on your action today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| We will amend and have an additional count to the complaint. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| Any other questions? I'm sorry. I overlooked your light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| so so the motion would be to send to go ahead and send it to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| administrative hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| Regardless, I mean we're acting as the beer board here. That's correct. Regardless of state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| You're you're acting under this state law and you're sending it under our city code to the hearing officer for a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| And that date is set for the pre-scheduling conferences next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| The hearing will likely be a month from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| maybe a little bit longer so the motion the proper motion be for the to skip to go ahead and make the motion to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| It to the the pre-scheduling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| Hearing to the hearing officer for a year. Okay next week whenever that might be we have a date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| August 29th. Okay, so it's kind of a loose motion, but that's the motion second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=474)|
| 0:08:01| Councilman de la vote. Can I ask one question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| Podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| You said the suspension from the ABC is going to end today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| Today, I mean you're opening the doors tomorrow. I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| Yes, thank you. I don't know whether we have any interim without a hearing we have to we can't do anything, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| We have to actually have the hearing before we can prevent a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| Resumption unless you decided to take emergency action. That's that's what would happen. They'd reopen and run their business until we have a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=511)|
| 0:08:41| Well, let's go back what's the emergency I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| With alleged violations the number of alleged violations, I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| I mean, I mean, I hate to see them open back up before we can have a hearing or take action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| But what's the emergency action we can take? Well, it's the law director upon consultation with the chair of the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=534)|
| 0:09:02| It's only been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| Ms. Evertine and I and Chairman Palmer have talked about that possibility in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| It's been used sparingly perhaps only twice once was where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| Somebody had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| Been over served at a location and they went out and hit somebody on Cumberland Avenue and all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=556)|
| 0:09:24| Violations while very important they occurred in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| The past not the immediate past the the distance past a few months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| So this might not at this point rise to the level to trigger that emergency ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| 45| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| Underage, I mean, I think that is I think that's where they have an emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| I mean, I'm in my opinion until until such time you have a hearing coming up in a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| If I can please intervene for just a minute that most of the violations occurred as a result of fake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=591)|
| 0:10:01| Fake car drivers licenses. There was a couple occasions where a cadet went in and bought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=601)|
| 0:10:09| Alcohol but most of them occurred as you guys know, it's been in the press| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| The fake identification is a major problem. We have sense and that's why I have mr. Hanna here. We have since bought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=615)|
| 0:10:24| Equipment to try to prevent in fact, we've had no violations since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| Early in 2012 and we have received a letter from the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| They've sent a cadet in there and we didn't sell him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| So I've got him here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| To give some testimony before we even get to vote for the hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| I've got some other arguments actually before you all go forward. I don't know what's not sure what's on the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=646)|
| 0:10:53| I know that the the agreement of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| Suspension is on under the agreed orders on the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| The way I need I read the statute. It says that the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| The beer board finds if the beer board finds a sufficient but a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| sufficient violation or violations of this chapter have occurred I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| Don't know what other than the allegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| The judgment that I signed for the for the suspension of the license does not mean does not say anything about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=680)|
| 0:11:28| That I we admitted any violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| What it says is that these matters were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| Resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| So, I don't know what the proof is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| Again, I'm not here to fight because there's a lot of stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| That is pending and I think we can get to the bottom of it at the next hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| But I do have some proof that we've complied with the law since then and there's no need for an emergency. Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=709)|
| 0:11:58| Councilman Delavaux, do you have anything new to add? Yeah quick one. I have a question. I have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| Yeah, quick one if we could ask perhaps. Mr. Hanna, would you tell us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| What you are doing now to make sure we're not serving underage while we await these hearings and whatnot that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=728)|
| 0:12:15| Scheduled in the future. What are you doing there? So that we know whether there's an emergency or not. I think that's the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120821?start=735)|
