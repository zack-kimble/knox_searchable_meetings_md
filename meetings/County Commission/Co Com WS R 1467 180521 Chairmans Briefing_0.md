| 0:00:43| I'm going to call to order this Chairman's briefing for May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=43)|
| 0:00:53| Over the last couple of years, I've had a thought about tourism in Knox County and Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=53)|
| 0:00:59| Visit Knoxville does such a great job with certain aspects of it, and they do a really good job with amateur sports tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=59)|
| 0:01:07| I wanted to look into seeing if there was more potential for us as a community to grow that industry in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=67)|
| 0:01:16| We appropriated some money last year to visit Knoxville to contract out a study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=76)|
| 0:01:22| and Don Schumacher with DSA Sports LLC did this study, and he's here to present it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=82)|
| 0:01:32| So, Don, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=92)|
| 0:01:39| Thanks very much, and I'm very, very pleased to have this opportunity to spend some time with all of you commissioners today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=99)|
| 0:01:47| sharing what we discovered as a result of the study that we conducted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=107)|
| 0:01:52| and I want to thank those of you that I spoke with at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=112)|
| 0:01:57| We had absolutely no difficulty getting cooperation from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=117)|
| 0:02:04| We got a lot of valuable input, and I've been doing this for quite a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| I've been in the sport tourism industry for more than 30 years now, and I've been consulting since 1995,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=129)|
| 0:02:16| and I guess maybe I've seen close to 200 cities and counties around the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=136)|
| 0:02:22| So I'm not telling you that to puff me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| I'm telling you that to assure you that when I look at Knoxville, I'm seeing it with what's going on out there in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=145)|
| 0:02:34| That's the purpose for my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| I'm hoping I can get through this in 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| I think I can because I can only touch the surface of a large report like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=161)|
| 0:02:50| and on the other hand, the salient points of it are what they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| and they're very easy for us to cover in the next few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| So with your permission, I will go through the project, starting with what were we hired to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=178)|
| 0:03:07| Our assignment was to survey the tournament quality sports facilities in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=187)|
| 0:03:14| not all of the recreational fields behind the elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| Look at your event hosting experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| I've been aware of what you've been doing here in Knoxville since the early 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| We interviewed stakeholders of many different kinds, including some of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| but across the broad spectrum of amateur sports organizations, facility managers, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=213)|
| 0:03:40| We did competitive research because, after all, you're not operating in a vacuum here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=220)|
| 0:03:47| Just in this very long state of Tennessee, you've got a lot of competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| A SWOT analysis was contracted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| We did a large number of case histories on indoor and outdoor sports facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| to help broaden the picture and understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| and then we were also asked to make suggestions on facilities development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| So what did we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| What we needed to do to accomplish those ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| We visited sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| I need to tell you that this was the quickest site visit in my entire professional life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=260)|
| 0:04:28| You have fewer tournament quality sports facilities in this area than any place of this size I've ever visited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=268)|
| 0:04:37| There are reasons for that, I'm sure, and we'll touch on some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| because you're probably thinking I'm here to talk about the sport tourism industry nationally, and I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=282)|
| 0:04:49| but anything you might do in the future starts with the people who live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=289)|
| 0:04:56| It doesn't start with visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| It starts with people here, and we'll get into that in a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=298)|
| 0:05:04| We conducted a lot of interviews, on the other hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| We had a great opportunity to catalog strengths and weaknesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| We understand fully the importance of the university and its facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| Your unique attributes became obvious to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| and we discussed the event experiences that the commission has had over the years that it's been in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=322)|
| 0:05:30| Kind of a snapshot of the sport tourism industry in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| A study was just released through Ohio University, where I'm on the faculty, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=336)|
| 0:05:44| that showed that this is continually a growing industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| It goes up 3 to 6 percent a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| It was closer to 5 percent between 17 and 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| but we estimate that for 2017, direct spending, not economic impact, but direct spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=355)|
| 0:06:04| new dollars, incremental dollars coming into local communities as the result of amateur sports events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=364)|
| 0:06:11| not the NFL, not collegiate sports, not high school sports, is at about $11.5 billion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=371)|
| 0:06:19| I remember when it was at 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| There are ticketed and participant-based events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| Ticketed events, you want to buy a ticket and see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| Participant-based events, 90-plus percent of the industry is participant-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| That's what Rocky Top attracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| That's what you've been attracting over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| At least 450 destinations now around the United States are competing for this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=401)|
| 0:06:49| When you have a win, you have won over several cities every time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| It's a facilities-driven industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| You either have them or you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| And the leadership here in Knoxville on the sports side historically has done a great job with what you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=421)|
| 0:07:09| Peace has been made with the shortcomings, and what you have has been emphasized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=429)|
| 0:07:16| which interestingly enough is the way this industry started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| It started by not building things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| Use what you have more intensively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| The university, I am reminded as soon as I talk about using facilities more intensively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=446)|
| 0:07:33| have some wonderful intramural fields that are not available for outside use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| That would be a nifty thing to change someday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| That would really be, because campus facilities can be unavailable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| High school facilities and college facilities were created for their constituency, not for the travel market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=466)|
| 0:07:54| But those uses, rather the use of those facilities can be extended to the travel market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=474)|
| 0:08:02| The trips that people take for these events are often mini vacations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| We've seen that going on since the recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| It's important that there be more things to see and do in a market besides going to the games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| The family likes to get out and see things, and lodging is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| Good quality, the right kinds of hotels, close enough to the right kinds of facilities, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=502)|
| 0:08:31| Visitor spending and economic impact, just a few thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| Visitor spending equals new dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| Local spending is redirected with no impact, no new impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=518)|
| 0:08:44| Visitors to youth tournaments will spend at least $75 a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| and that includes sharing rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| If the room's $150 and two people are in it, it's $75 a day per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| If there are four in it, you divide 150 by four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| So you can't count the cost of the room for everybody that's at the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| But to give you an idea, one small event of 50 teams over a couple, three days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=547)|
| 0:09:13| and this is worked out for you in the report, can produce $250,000 to $300,000 in new dollars for this economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=553)|
| 0:09:21| and those are taxed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| Those are taxable transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| Cities are building for the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| Rocky Top is one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| I worry about that sometimes because you're a recognized destination with a lot of history in the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=571)|
| 0:09:38| and you know what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| Boy, there are some cities getting into it now where they're building facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| and they actually believe that movie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| If you build it, they will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| Well, that's a fable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| That's a movie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| It's not real life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| People deal with people they know and trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| and it's not enough to have the newest fields on the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| You also have to have the expertise, the right location, right destination, right hotels, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=599)|
| 0:10:06| And the crucial importance of building for residents first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| What are the unmet local needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| How can those be filled with new facilities, and if they can be filled with new facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=614)|
| 0:10:20| and it's affordable, then outside spending can be attracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=620)|
| 0:10:27| Knoxville lacks tournament quality facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| There's a relative lack of off-campus facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| So there has been an emphasis on the convention center and the roadways of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=636)|
| 0:10:43| for running events and cycling and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| Knox County Sports Park and Caswell Park are the only two four-plexes in the region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=646)|
| 0:10:54| and they're 30 minutes apart, and tournament directors don't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| The good news is they're both good quality complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| So the convention center has been very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| Visit Knoxville has recognized that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| It owns ten portable courts and goals for basketball and volleyball, as I'm sure you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| and the refurbished World's Fair Exhibition Hall offers some new potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| Wouldn't it be great if most every weekend those courts are set up and an event takes place there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| What is it, 70,000 or 80,000 square feet, something in that range of new space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| Tommy Shumpert Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| If you want to see what good fields are, go to your own park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| Those rectangular fields are terrific, absolutely terrific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| And the youth soccer organization has grass fields on adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=706)|
| 0:11:52| It would really be nice if the day could come where a youth tournament could take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| that would utilize the park fields and the AYSO fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| I also understand, and this may or may not be the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| that perhaps that park could be expanded geographically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| That's the place to put more rectangular fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| Rectangular fields, not soccer fields, because that's soccer, lacrosse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=733)|
| 0:12:19| it could even be field hockey, youth football, so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=739)|
| 0:12:26| The urban wilderness and the new BMX track and stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| are going to make a major competitive difference for you folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| The BMX track and stadium is going to be quite unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| There are not very many places, maybe one or two in other parts of the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| where you've got 4,500 or so seats at a first-class BMX track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| I believe you're going to do very well with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| Can I stop you just for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| On that BMX track, we're having some budget issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| Are lights essential to success to that, or is that a plus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| It's a big plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| Plus bordering on essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| Because those events are going to take, they can't wrap them up in time in most cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=790)|
| 0:13:16| And certainly when you get to the older age groups and the more skilled athletes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| they're going to need to compete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| And, gee, that's the first time I've heard any comment in my whole career in sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| about budget issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| Yeah, never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| This is another first today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| Boy, if you're trying to do a project, there's always budget issues that aren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| So what happened with our interviews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| We talked to key stakeholders from your corporate and hospitality communities and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| What did we find out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| Lack of facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| If there are few places to play, how will there ever be enough places to practice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| And if young people can't practice, why would they stay in sports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| And we want them in sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| We don't need them to be elite athletes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| We need our young people to participate in sports so they can be active| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| and they can be more physically healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| The inability to practice can discourage players from going any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| And the convention center, I just glowed brightly about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| is often unavailable for sports events because it has other obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| And it depends a lot on the pricing as to sometimes who wins out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=869)|
| 0:14:35| because sports events historically can't afford the rent that a convention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| or a trade show or a meeting might be able to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| Intermural fields, sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| Well, they don't have a good parking area either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| Yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| Intermural fields at UT are unavailable for outside uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| That just grinds me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| I would do something about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| I just love those fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| They are terrific, and they are turf, and you're not going to hurt them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| Enroll in UT and you can use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| Enroll in UT and you can use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| Well, maybe I could teach there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| It's kind of a long drive every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| They'd still say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| I wish I could tell you a story about Texas A&M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| We don't have the time, but there was a way finally for College Station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| to get onto those fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| So we kind of started thinking about maybe there's going to be some big box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| space available someday around the area that perhaps could be used for indoor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| courts instead of building something from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| The SWOT analysis, you can see what they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| I think the weaknesses and threats are what we'll look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| Lack of dates at the center, campus facilities usually unavailable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=954)|
| 0:16:00| Troubling, you can't host the big three, soccer, fast pitch, and youth baseball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| the three biggest travel sports in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| For a lot of reasons, focused almost entirely on age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=969)|
| 0:16:16| 10 to 12 years old is the sweet spot for traveling teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| And there are so many traveling soccer, fast pitch, and youth baseball teams in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=981)|
| 0:16:28| the 10 to 12 bracket that it's extremely attractive business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=988)|
| 0:16:35| Doing nothing, ignoring the impact of Rocky Top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| and the continual development of sports facilities in rural areas around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| southeast are things that are threats to your future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1004)|
| 0:16:53| There are a lot of people who would rather compete in a refurbished and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1013)|
| 0:17:00| attractive downtown like you have than in getting into traffic in a resort area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1020)|
| 0:17:08| in those summer months when school is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| The fact that they've got six courts on their campus and four more at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| schools adjacent and they've got their rectangular fields is a matter of fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| now, I think you'll do very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| We're going to suggest a study to determine that, but I think you'll do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| very well in comparison because life is a little more pleasant here in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| summertime than it might be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| We provided a large number of case histories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| Indoor, Rocky Top, Boo Williams Sportsplex out in Virginia, Myrtle Beach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1063)|
| 0:17:50| Sports Center, and the Round Rock Sports Center, those last two I had quite a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| to do with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| In indoor events, one 80-team tournament with six courts could produce 720,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| in direct visitor spending plus taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| Now, you can do that with the courts you have, and you are doing that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1086)|
| 0:18:13| And if you had access to the space to set the courts up more often, you would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1093)|
| 0:18:20| a lot more of those events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| Outdoor, here in the state, we looked at the Mike Rose Soccer Complex out in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1102)|

| 0:18:38| One 100-team event with 10 or 12 fields could produce at least 900,000 in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| visitor spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| Observations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| Lack of multi-field and court facilities for local and outside use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| Only four multi-field complexes exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| One is for youth football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| Then two for fast pitch and youth baseball, and, of course, slow pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| And one for soccer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| And then, Knoxville Sports Commission has pulled rabbits out of the hat year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| after year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| I'm sure Chad and Parker can continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| They'd like to be a little less creative once in a while and have a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1161)|

| 0:20:27| I'd love to clarify some of the things I might have said at your pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1227)|
| 0:20:34| A couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| At the beginning you talked about facilities that are already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| elementary schools, middle schools, high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| Is there a market if we upgraded some of those to tournament?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| Are they too far apart or is there a market for that if we did upgrade them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| because then the community could have an asset and then also it's an asset for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| tourism?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| Unfortunately, event planners would like multi-fields in one or two places instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1254)|
| 0:21:02| of eight fields in eight places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| That's the downfall of using high school baseball fields just as one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| How do you best recommend dealing with the University of Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| I'm sorry, I didn't quite hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| How do you best recommend supporting a discussion with the University of Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| Well, I think just doing what a nice group of people would do and have full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| conversation back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| There may be a really good reason why those fields are not available that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1294)|
| 0:21:41| unaware of as an outsider from Cincinnati, but I'd rather think things could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| worked out because they are not being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| That property is locked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| I would say the University of Tennessee, given their facilities away, is not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| valid precedent because right now we've got destination imagination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| We just get people to come in, which is a whole bunch of kids come here for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| leadership training and studying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| The problem is they're staying in our dorms rather than hotels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| although the restaurants are still open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| There is some precedent as to being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Well, you had, what was the big sports event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1342)|
| 0:22:28| AAU Junior Olympic Games here some years back and athletes stayed in the dormitories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| I mean, what I might ask is, Kim, destination imagination, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| they're primarily staying at dorms, but where's it all spread out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| Well, actually, over the last 19 years, like when they started in the original,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| they were mostly dorms, but now they're dorms, hotels, all venues and convention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| It's so big they have to kill them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| This is their annual global finals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| They literally come here and they have a competition and then the rest of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| time they're within our destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| So, I mean, it is a great partnership with the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| I don't want anybody to leave here thinking I said the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| doesn't cooperate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| They don't let people use the intramural fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1392)|
| 0:23:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| Those are the most attractive facilities they have on their entire campus for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| the purposes of sport tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| Don?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| You have been in this business a long time and done probably hundreds of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| How do you think we are positioned, in your opinion, to move forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| sports tourism?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| And before you answer, I think we need to give hats off to Kim and Chad and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| sports tourism industry, what they've been able to do with the assets we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| There's one reason I wanted to look at this, because I know what they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| capable of if they were given the right assets and the things that Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| and Knox will bring to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| You've got the geographic location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| You're accessible to the entire Midwest and Southeast, which is where the bulk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| of this activity takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| That's number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| You're easy to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| It took me four hours and 15, four hours and 30 minutes maybe to get here from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| Cincinnati.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| Any team would drive that distance in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| And better than all of that, you've got a highly experienced staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| And that's the game changer, because these event people need to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1467)|
| 0:24:34| people they know and trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| Kingsport is uncommonly successful for the same reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| They've got people in Kingsport that people know and trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| Together, you do better than Memphis does on a good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| Don't tell anybody I said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| But it's true, because you've got the expertise here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| What you don't have are the kinds of things you'd most like to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| generate more business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| And some of this is shoulder season business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| It's not June, July, August, and forget it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| There are a lot of things you can do in the spring, because your weather is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| better in the spring than ours is in terms of practices and tours for college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| and high school teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| And the same is true into the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| You mentioned a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| Could you just give us a brief top five that we would have to have right away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| to really get with it, the top five things we would need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| I'm not even sure I have to go to five, but I'll see how this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| Number one, you need access to set up the ten courts that you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| You need a place where you can set those courts up, and a convention center is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| perfect because the hotels, restaurants, and all are close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| That's number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Number two, you need more rectangular fields, either at Tommy Shumpert Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| or someplace else, because, after all, that is on the edge of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| It's getting out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| If you had 10 to 12 rectangular fields, and some of them were turf fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| not all grass, you could really do a job in multiple sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1580)|
| 0:26:27| You need more 300-foot diamonds, because a 300-foot diamond can enable you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1587)|
| 0:26:35| to do four things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| First thing, traditional slow pitch with a skinned infield and 300-foot fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| Second thing, girls' fast pitch, same diamond, but bring the fence in to 200| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| to 220 feet, depending on what the teams want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| So that's number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| Youth baseball can use that same skinned infield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| They don't even need an outfield, because in youth baseball, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| they chase the ball down and try to get it back in play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| And then finally, and importantly, we've learned a lot about how to put a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| soccer field on a ball diamond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| And a Grand Slam home run might be a complex where each baseball field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1635)|
| 0:27:22| contains a soccer field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| If you could imagine the end line of the soccer field on the third base side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1645)|
| 0:27:33| of a diamond, and that's the back of the end zone in soccer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| And that rectangular field goes out to right center field, and it goes further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| than the 300-foot fence, because you need more room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| What you do is you put a permanent fence out there that has a bulge in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| and then you use this temporary fence to make it a 300-foot diamond for slow pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1674)|
| 0:28:02| People will say to me, Don, but slow pitch is dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| It's not doing as well as it used to do, but there's still 12 to 15 million players.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| And you know they drink beer, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| They also fish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| I think I'm one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| Do those diamonds be turf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| In this day and age, it would be great if they would be turf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1703)|
| 0:28:30| But somehow I think a budget issue might come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| Service-wise, do baseball teams prefer a diamond turf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| Well, in the absolute, baseball teams like grass and dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| But if you give them a beautiful turf field, and the Cal Ripken people have all turf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1725)|
| 0:28:53| The base pads are turf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| They're just brown, and everything else is green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| Kids will play on it in a heartbeat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| It's a maintenance, and you don't want to cancel your tournament because of weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1741)|
| 0:29:09| Turf fields hold up much better to the weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| The one thing we always have to cancel or hold up, postpone, wait a couple hours is electrical storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1752)|
| 0:29:20| That's the only thing that you have to wait out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| Now, you asked for five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| That's three and a half, and I'm content to stop right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| I don't have to go further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| Let me follow up on Commissioner Brantley's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| So if we're looking for acreage, number one, how many acreage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| You've been visiting all these parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| And what is the number of rectangular-type fields that you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| Are we talking about eight or 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| I'd say 10 to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| 10 to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| Chad and I and Parker and I were talking about this a couple of hours ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| and I made this observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| To do a U.S. soccer regional, which is one of the most prestigious events, you need 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1799)|
| 0:30:06| But you can do great business with 10 or 12 and not spend all that money on the extra fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1806)|
| 0:30:13| which are certainly not going to be needed by the young people who live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1813)|
| 0:30:19| And that's one of the things a feasibility study can help us determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| And that is, what's the magic number in Knoxville in terms of the number of fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| that can be kept busy by locals, if you will, Monday through Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| and then available for more outside use Friday, Saturday, Sunday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| That 10 to 12, how many acres is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| Soccer field, let's see, two acres, two-and-a-half acres of field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1844)|
| 0:30:50| So 30, 35 acres with plenty of room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| One of the things that a soccer complex needs more than any other complex is a three-lane road for access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1855)|
| 0:31:03| Two in and two out, depending on the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| Those doggone games all start and finish at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| So you need to have two lanes in at all times or two lanes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| And, of course, one lane for emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| Let's talk about the old adage, real estate, location, location, location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| That's got to be important because here in Knox County, we know most of your hotels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| either north or west, east is getting some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| But how important is location, location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| Is that 1A, 1B, or 2, or 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| The location of the fields needs to be convenient to a sufficient number of hotels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1902)|
| 0:31:49| to pretty well take care of the demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| So it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| But I would suggest to you that people will drive an extra five miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| to work with people they trust on good quality fields because it really will make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| And that's where turf comes in because a tournament manager would know if you had turf fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| the number of lost games is going to be at an absolute minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| because they're going to be able to get, if they promise three or four games to a team for the weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1936)|
| 0:32:23| and it rains, sometimes the teams go home feeling short of change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| because they had to pay a fee based on four, and the organizer says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| you can't blame me, we got rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| But it's nice to be able to say, we got your games in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| When it comes to the competing space to get folks to become a joint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| can you all hear me, I'm sorry I'm not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1969)|
| 0:32:57| I'm sure it's very competitive to get folks to switch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| Within this field, let's say we develop some sort of complex that's county-owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| or a public-private partnership, based on your experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| I mean, we've got one of the top competitors in our backyard with some of the facilities up in Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| How often, how frequent do folks who are tournament directors, the decision makers in this field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| for them to keep interest within their clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| how often do they see the benefits of switching if they've been going to a particular venue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| or a place for a number of years, or do they like to rotate between venues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| I mean, I can tell you this, my perspective, I worked at Disney World for 14 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| and to fill our shoulder seasons early in my career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| we hired Reggie Williams and opened a Disney World of Sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| and it drove incredible room nights in our dead season and shoulder seasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| So kind of tell me your take on the competitive part and stealing groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| First of all, let's imagine that you announce that you're going to build a complex or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| whatever the announcement is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| You start selling it that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| You use the media conference to begin pre-selling events two and three years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| If they're grass fields, you're looking at one more year before you can get on the fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| That's an important factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| That grass has got to set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| You just can't play on it right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| So you start pre-selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| Your staff here already has relationships in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| and it's not so much a matter of stealing as it is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| It's getting the word out that Knoxville is very much in the game now with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| let's just focus on a 10- or 12-field rectangular complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2084)|
| 0:34:50| Very much in the game now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| You know that Knoxville is a good destination, and you know us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| That gets you on their rotation of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| yeah, we've got to listen to them the next time we bid our event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2099)|
| 0:35:06| You said rotation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| It's a very important point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| The national events and even the regional events you might get do rotate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| They don't want to come to the same place all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| The solution for all of that is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| You build your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| You partner with your local soccer organizations, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| and build a tournament where 10 of the teams are from here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| and 90 are from far enough away that they've got to stay here overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| By the way, I've always said it doesn't matter where you live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| It only matters you can't get home tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| That's all that counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| Teams from Seattle don't do you any more good than teams from Cincinnati| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| because it's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| I think I pretty well answered that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Sir, I have some friends who drive from Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| from just outside of Atlanta,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| and bring their children here on weekends to play ice hockey and games| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| at the rink that's out in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| It seems to be very popular because they don't have it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| Can we build on that idea too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| First of all, they're crazy people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| Second of all, the trouble with ice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| and I think you're talking specifically about ice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| you need multiple sheets of ice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| Indoor swimming pools and indoor ice arenas are the most expensive to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2194)|
| 0:36:41| and maintain in our industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| To get a foothold in ice, you'd need probably four to six sheets of ice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2203)|
| 0:36:50| I don't see that as a reasonable investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| Somebody may disagree, but I think you go with what you've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| Buffalo makes a lot of money on ice hockey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| I want to ask about the BMX track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| Help me understand the draw, the regional, the national,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2226)|
| 0:37:14| the rotation of that, and the significance of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| Can you help explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| First of all, BMX as a sport has exploded in the United States at all age levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2240)|
| 0:37:27| It's a real hoot to see four-year-olds on the BMX track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2247)|
| 0:37:35| They don't go fast enough to hurt themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| and they've got pads on anyway on up to 40-year-olds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| and then people much older than 40 that have forgotten they're no longer 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| USA BMX is the sanctioning body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| the official sanctioning body for the sport of BMX in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| They have a very aggressive series of national events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| They love the Southeast and the Midwest, love it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| because of the population density that we offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| They can get a lot more people in Knoxville than they can to Little Rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| And there's nothing wrong, obviously, with Little Rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| Just not as many people live there or around there as live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| And so BMX is a sport that when I was a kid didn't even make the radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2303)|
| 0:38:32| There's nothing to it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| But today it's a much different thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| And I would say the average national event would bring 2,000 to 3,000 riders plus family and friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2318)|
| 0:38:49| So it's a good business to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| It's also a business where you can't have major events every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| You'll have to be in a rotation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| But we all know the key guy at USA BMX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| He's a friend of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| And he's a friend of yours by extension because Chad and Parker know him very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| and is on the board of the National Association of Sports Commissions presently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| So I think that will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| Yeah?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| If we're doing, say, soccer, would you picture soccer as being the moneymaker of baseball or softball?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2360)|
| 0:39:29| Use the mic, Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| You're saying the big moneymakers are soccer, baseball, and softball, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| And you need a venue of about 35 acres to build those type facilities, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| You'd need 35 acres to build, say, 12 rectangular fields, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| You'd need more room for diamonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| Or you would need 30-plus acres for diamonds and not have much room for rectangular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| Or you'd build diamonds that have that soccer field potential across the baseball field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2403)|
| 0:40:11| Does that include parking and facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| If 10 times two and a half is 25 acres just for 10 fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2415)|
| 0:40:22| obviously you're going to need 10 to 15 more acres for roadways, parking, picnic tables, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2422)|
| 0:40:32| The biggest thing in Sevierville are the baseball fields that they've made up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| That is turf is the amount of distance that the people have to walk to get to see their grandchildren and other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2437)|
| 0:40:45| because it is a walking facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| You have to park way away and then get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| So there has to be certain design issues to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| It's like designing anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| They're industry best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| But we have to recognize one of the reasons why I suspect that's the case at Rocky Top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2458)|
| 0:41:04| is you're geographically challenged for flat space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| You've got a lot of hills and not a whole lot of flat, and that's certainly true up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2467)|
| 0:41:14| So sometimes you've got to walk around the hill to get to parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| But ideally the property is well-drained and pretty flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2478)|
| 0:41:25| You can also do very well terracing fields with two or three levels of fields on a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2485)|
| 0:41:36| I know we're talking a lot about team sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| I've had a couple of people that have asked about equestrian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| Do you know of any studies on equestrian and what value that brings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| Well, if you have a major equestrian event, they bring considerable value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2507)|
| 0:41:54| I'm thinking right now of a show that takes place in Blowing Rock, North Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2514)|
| 0:42:01| which is right near Boone up in the hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| It's about 3,300 feet elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| They have a horse show every year, and I think they've done that show for 40-plus years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2527)|
| 0:42:15| And you're looking at thousands of people over a period of several weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| because they have different classes that will come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| There have been a couple of megacomplexes built in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| One is in West Palm Beach, and another one is in North Carolina, Tryon, North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2548)|
| 0:42:35| And those facilities are beyond your imagination, beyond your imagination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2555)|
| 0:42:41| And at a certain point, they have to get the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| Just let them have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| So you wouldn't even do a small center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| If you're not in it now, I wouldn't get into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| Franklin County, Tennessee, has a very nice equestrian program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| and they've got an indoor facility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| They do a terrific job, and I dare say they serve the needs of this part of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2582)|
| 0:43:10| Conyers, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| Conyers, yep, that's another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| You had mentioned about retrofitting a big box store for indoor activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2596)|
| 0:43:23| What type of square footage do you need, 60,000 to 100,000 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| And do most of these big box have the adequate headspace height?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| Headspace turns out not to be the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| The problem you run into with a building that had a Home Depot or a Lowe's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| or what have you in it are the spacings of the posts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| And you've got to be able to get at least high school-sized basketball floors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| not only between the posts but with enough room to make it safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| We have one facility that would match that here, the standard knitting mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| Our report talks about a facility in Fort Wayne, Indiana that was a warehouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| that is one of the most successful eight-court facilities in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| And it happens those pillars in that building don't interfere with high school-sized basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2655)|
| 0:44:23| College floors are bigger than high school floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| Don, we have about 14 minutes before we have to go to our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| You had spoke about a follow-up study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| If you would give us some information on what that is and what that would entail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| I think these notions need to be tested some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2677)|
| 0:44:44| I'm not ready to say that I understand the local unmet needs sufficiently yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2684)|
| 0:44:51| And I think numbers need to be, first of all, we have to talk to the people in detail about what ifs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2691)|
| 0:45:01| More the players and the team people than the folks that own things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| Because the folks that own things are going to say, yes, yes, yes, we've got to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| By the way, I always talk to athletic directors and never coaches because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| Because coaches have always got just one more thing they need to be a winner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| And athletic directors know that's not necessarily the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| But we need more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| And then to see what the market's really saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| Because I'm dead serious about if there aren't any unmet local needs, you ought not to build for the travel market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2732)|
| 0:45:40| Don't be like Westfield, Indiana, where Grand Park is located, G-R-A-N-D Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2740)|
| 0:45:50| They have upwards of 50 fields, 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| Now, there are days during the summer when it is nothing but people everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2754)|
| 0:46:02| But how many days out of 365 do you suppose that's the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2762)|
| 0:46:09| There just aren't enough people to travel to central Indiana on a given weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2769)|
| 0:46:17| week after week after week to keep that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| And so the business is savvy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| In the southeast, which is ground zero for sport tourism, cities are learning how to share teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2783)|
| 0:46:31| Dothan, Alabama, for example, is very, very good at fast pitch and slow pitch softball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2791)|
| 0:46:38| And they have wonderful fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| In fact, their fields are so good, they ought to be spanked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180521ChairmansBriefing?start=2801)|
