| 0:01:44| And waiting on Commissioner Boesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=104)|
| 0:01:51| Ten members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| Okay. We can go ahead and begin moving through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| So, Madam Clerk, would you call the first one, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=118)|
| 0:02:02| Okay. Item number 49, 8-H-19-RZ has been deferred. We're going to page 11, item number 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=122)|
| 0:02:12| Request that Scott Davis, Asana Investments, LLC, for residing from A. Agricultural to P.R. Planned Residential up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=132)|
| 0:02:23| Property is located at 9127-9137-9141 in 0 Bluegrass Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=143)|
| 0:02:30| Parcel ID 144-114-115-116 and 111.01. This is in the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=150)|
| 0:02:43| All right. Thank you. Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=163)|
| 0:02:49| Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| All right. I'm just double checking. Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| Yes, sir. Scott Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| Okay. All right. Okay. Mr. Green, could you go ahead and give us a quick summary of this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=177)|
| 0:03:03| Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| Chairman, members of the Commission, the Planning Commission voted by 12-0 to recommend approval of the P.R. Planned Residential zoning up to 3.45 dwelling units an acre for this property because it is consistent with the LDR plan classification for the southwest county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=185)|
| 0:03:24| and also is compliant with the slope analysis for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| There were some questions via email regarding notification and advertising for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=207)|
| 0:03:36| This first appeared on the Planning Commission agenda in February and was postponed for a couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=216)|
| 0:03:44| When a postponement occurs, there is no new notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| We try to reduce the amount of paperwork and the cost to all involved, but depend on the applicant or the neighbors, that first notification to stay tuned with the application through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=228)|
| 0:04:00| There were also questions regarding the compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| Actually, there are three projects that go together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| The next three will become one project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| They're all contiguous properties, and they all depend on the same access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| There was a question regarding whether that access agreement was compliant with the Homeowners Association standards and agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=256)|
| 0:04:24| And considering the use of property, the Planning Commission nor Knox County neither review and look at private agreements such as Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=264)|
| 0:04:36| We look at the legal ramifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| We check with Jim Snowden of Engineering and Public Works as to whether the easement would meet the requirements for a public street access to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=278)|
| 0:04:46| We did all our due diligence with regard to the compliance of this with the standards of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=286)|
| 0:04:52| However, we did not review private agreements between private individuals because they are not within the purview of the Planning Commission nor Knox County to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=292)|
| 0:05:02| Again, the Planning Commission voted unanimously to approve the rezoning at 3.45 building units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| Scott Davis, PO Box 11315, Knoxville 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=315)|
| 0:05:22| And y'all may want to, and this is at Charles Will, but 49, 50, and 51 are all related to the same properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=322)|
| 0:05:31| I guess I am 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| I'm looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Yes, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Could the applicant turn his video on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| If I know how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| Let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| Start video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| I don't know if you want to see me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| So, you said items 49, 50, and 51 were all related to the same item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=357)|
| 0:06:04| Mr. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| I think it's 49, 50, 51, and 52, if I'm looking at the gender correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| It is not 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| It's 50, 51, and 52, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| 50, 51, and 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| Yeah, that threw me off when you said 49, because I knew that one had been postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| to the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| I think I know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| Is there any opposition present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| Mr. Helton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| What I'd like to do, so Mr. Green has given a quick overview of what was proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=397)|
| 0:06:45| We have both the applicant and opposition present at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| So, what I'm going to do is give each side approximately seven minutes just to sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=409)|
| 0:06:56| make a statement or talk about what this particular, either why they're doing it, why it should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| be approved, or what the problems were with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| So, I'm going to give the applicant, Mr. Davis, the first shot at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| I'll yield to the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=433)|
| 0:07:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| Mr. Helton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| Yes, I'm Cliff Helton, 1205 Coyle Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Commissioners and Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| First of all, I want to commend you guys for continuing this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=446)|
| 0:07:32| This is the second one of these meetings I've attended, and I know it's been challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| And I must say, kind of following rezoning through this has been quite challenging from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| a citizen standpoint as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| Let me first say, I'm here on my own behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| I do not represent the interests of the Pine Springs neighborhood residents, the adjoining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=468)|
| 0:07:56| neighborhood, or Mrs. Hobson, who is part of this process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=476)|
| 0:08:03| She's an adjoining property owner that has, or shares the right-of-way that is, or excuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| me, a joint permanent easement that is part of this rezoning, or the access to this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=488)|
| 0:08:15| But I will refer to them, and I hope that they're watching tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| As I said, we own 1205 Coyle Lane, which is a five-acre, or approximately five-acre tract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| that borders roughly 460 feet of the nine-acre tract, which is, I believe that is item 52.3H20RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=505)|
| 0:08:36| As I kind of dove into this thing, and Mr. Davis has been very, you know, I've had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| couple conversations, both by email and text, and by phone, and he's been helpful for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=520)|
| 0:08:47| most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| I had a little bit of trouble getting a couple things to ask for, but he got those to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| And I do appreciate that, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| So, when I looked at this, I was more or less looking at it, how it affected, or the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=535)|
| 0:09:01| for a development would affect our property from a visibility standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=541)|
| 0:09:08| We've got a pretty good view from where we are up on top of the hill, and I wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| see where rooftops, and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| So, I wanted to see elevations, and kind of how it related to our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| And as I kind of dove into the rezoning and the potential development as a whole, it raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=559)|
| 0:09:26| multiple questions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| I've never been on this side of one of these rezonings, and so it was kind of interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| being on this side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| It appears that most of the people that are being affected by this do not know anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| about it, or very little, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| I visited with Mrs. Hobson at 9125 Bluegrass on Tuesday the 19th, that was last Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| She's the person that shares the joint permanent easement, and that actually provides the majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| or all the access currently, to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| And just to see where she stood on the potential development, and she had no idea about tonight's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=597)|
| 0:10:04| vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| I asked her about signage, because there was none up that night, that was Tuesday of last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| week, on any of the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| And she said she had not seen some for quite some time, were her exact words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| So, that evening, I went door to door and spoke to five different residents in Pine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| Springs, three of which backed up to the property being potentially rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=622)|
| 0:10:32| They knew nothing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| Well, excuse me, I take that back, two of them knew something about the rezoning, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| none of them had any idea about tonight's meeting, and had multiple questions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=637)|
| 0:10:43| They also did not realize that one of their neighbors has granted a 40-foot right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| through the back of her subdivision property, nor did they understand the potential impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=649)|
| 0:10:57| both from a traffic standpoint and a school standpoint, because I immediately got tons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| of questions regarding both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| I've gone on to speak since then, or later that week, I've spoken with three of the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=666)|
| 0:11:14| Pine Springs 2 Homeowners Association president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| Pine Springs 2 is a development attached to the backside of this front section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| Parts of Pine Springs 2, I believe, touch this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| The Homeowners Association president knew nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| Another Homeowners Association member knew nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| A former member of this Homeowners Association knew nothing, and confirmed that they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| not seen any advertisements, signage, for this rezoning tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| I met with Chairman Nystrom, who was kind enough to meet me out there on Saturday, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| past Saturday, and we found the signs behind the locked gate on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| Mr. Chairman Nystrom was able to finagle those out, and we reinstalled them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| I'm hoping some of those citizens are watching tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| I realize you guys do not consider private subdivision restrictions as part of rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=725)|
| 0:12:12| matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| Mrs. Hobson, it would seem though, in this matter, Mrs. Hobson's joint permanent easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| agreement is made part of the MPC documentation, and it clearly states that she has a restriction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| on the portion of the property that's not being rezoned tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| I think it already has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| I'm not exactly sure what the rezoning is on it, but it will be part of an ultimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| The property owner in Pine Springs that has granted this 40-foot easement, as I say, appears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=757)|
| 0:12:44| to, which this access is reliant upon, is at this point, and what's being proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=764)|
| 0:12:51| relies on this 40-foot easement that violates the subdivision covenants and restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=771)|
| 0:12:58| As I said, all of this hinges the access to this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| If you've looked at your documentation, which I'm sure you have, there's a choke point that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| all this 25-foot joint permanent easement and right-of-way come together that provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=787)|
| 0:13:13| the access to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| It's a split piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| I think it's 2F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| It's separate from 2E and 3H, and there's a 75-foot stretch that has to come across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| or appears to be about 75 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| So, this thing is anything but straightforward, the access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| In an email that's on page 17 of your MPC documentations, there's an email exchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=810)|
| 0:13:37| between Liz Albertson and Mr. Davis on the 24th and 25th of February where she questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=817)|
| 0:13:44| this access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| Mr. Davis states that his understanding is that you can access Grand Residential over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=825)|
| 0:13:53| Residential A. Mrs. Albertson's email seems to disagree with that, and there's no...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=833)|
| 0:14:02| Mrs. Hobson's property that contains the joint permanent easement is zoned Agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| Now, I'm no zoning expert, but I thought that both of those pieces would have to be rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| in order to gain access, and I don't see any resolution to those two matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=853)|
| 0:14:22| Right now, I'm simply asking you guys to postpone the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| I'm not necessarily opposed to Mr. Davis's development, but being on this side of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| it's been kind of interesting with just the lack of information that's out there that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| being provided to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| And so, at this point, I would just ask that you postpone your vote at least until the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=878)|
| 0:14:45| citizenry that's affected by this can be a little bit better informed, have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| to be informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| And certainly, Mrs. Williams needs to be informed by someone that she's in violation of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| covenants and restrictions, and she may find herself in civil court before all this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| done if one of her neighbors decides to pursue civil action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| So, just want to make you guys aware of all that, because it's complicated rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=906)|
| 0:15:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| Thank you, Mr. Helton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| And by the way, what will probably happen with this, Mr. Helton, is Mr. Davis will make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| a statement, and then I'm sure some of the commissioners will probably have some questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| and you may get called on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| So, I know Mr. Davis has been here quite a few times, and that was how it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| Go ahead, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| And I appreciate y'all's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| And all we're looking at tonight is whether or not the zoning is appropriate for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| By unanimous vote of MPC, it was voted that yes, the zoning is appropriate for the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| for all the reasons that Mr. Green stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| The access, everything else that Mr. Helton has referred to has nothing to do with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| All we're doing tonight is asking whether or not this is an appropriate zoning for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| As you all know, all the other issues that were described by Mr. Helton, and no due respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| to Mr. Helton, all those are dealt with through the concept plan and through engineering and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Prior to going through all of those steps and spending thousands and thousands and thousands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| of dollars, we first need to know whether or not we can develop the property and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| can get the zoning that we have requested and that MPC unanimously approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| As it relates to notice, every single adjacent property owner receives notice from MPC, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=993)|
| 0:16:40| you all were aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| We have put up signs actually three different times because this has been postponed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| moved and changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| The signs went up three different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| Signs do not go up for county commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| Signs go up, as you know, and notices go out for MPC meetings and not for county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1012)|
| 0:17:00| meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| So, what I'm asking for tonight is respectfully approved as per MPC's unanimous vote to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1022)|
| 0:17:09| the zoning for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Thank you, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| Let me pull up the participant box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| There may be some questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| I've got one kind of question right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| Mr. Green, we've seen a whole lot of zonings come through, and I don't know that I've ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| seen one come through that's settled at 3.45 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1050)|
| 0:17:37| Usually, it's three and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| I mean, there's some sort of math behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| I'm really curious where that 3.45 number came from as the recommendation, because usually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| you know, we're talking threes, three and a half, fours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| I guess, in terms of what Mr. Davis is planning, where did that number come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| I know that Mr. Davis has originally asked for, I think, for five, but where did that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| number, it would usually be three and a half or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| Was there something in the land that drove that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| There was some math involved, and it was regarding the slope analysis for, and as we stated before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1085)|
| 0:18:12| there are three properties that are grouped together and three cases that are grouped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| The property designated, which has the file number, the first one that came in, 2E20RZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| which is the one we are now, had a slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| I'm trying to remember this, but about 3.3 units an acre, that's what the slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1106)|
| 0:18:33| stated should be developed on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| The other large property, which was a separate file number, 3H20RZ, had a slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1116)|
| 0:18:42| These may be reversed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| That called for 3.6 units an acre, which is, well, 3.3, 3.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| Midpoint is 3.45 for the two properties together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1129)|
| 0:18:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| Yes, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| This question is for Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| Can you go to the color drawing on page 18 of this file?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1146)|
| 0:19:13| And I don't have the file that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| I have the planning file, and what I have is a color drawing that shows the zoning of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| the surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| Is that the one you're speaking of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| This one was sent with a little red circle drawn around it to how the two properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1166)|
| 0:19:33| are going to connect from Bluegrass Road to the major development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| Is that where they're talking about the easement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| There's a problem there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| That's the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| And again, we delayed work with Mr. Davis since February, or earlier, since January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1183)|
| 0:19:52| to try to address the access to this property to ensure that we have the guarantee of access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1192)|
| 0:19:59| necessary for the Planning Commission to recommend approval for staff to recommend approval and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| for Planning Commission to carry forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| As Mr. Davis said, there are still details to be worked out with the road construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1206)|
| 0:20:13| during the concept plan and the engineering of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| But we communicated with Engineering and Public Works and the joint public easement that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| negotiated between Mr. Davis and I don't think it was Hobson, I think it was the other lady,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1222)|
| 0:20:29| met the requirements to guarantee access as needed for a zoning recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1229)|
| 0:20:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| Well, so is the property that's classified as 111, is that where the easement is being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1239)|
| 0:20:47| granted from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| And I don't have the same drawing that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| I'm looking for the one with the red circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| I got you, Cliff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| I'll get to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| I was going to help Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| The 111, I'm sorry, sir, the 111 is where the joint, that's Ms. Hobson's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| that's the joint permitted easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| You see the Pine Springs lot number three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| It kind of has a, it creates, it helps to hit the choke point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| The 40-foot right-of-way comes across that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| I mean, I guess, are there any other questions about this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| I had one, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Mr. Green, so am I correct in saying that the access for planned residential cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1304)|
| 0:21:55| be across agricultural or residential A zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| Am I incorrect in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| They're all allowed residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| And so our interpretation is since agricultural allows residential uses, then residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| access can be provided across agriculturally zoned land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| Again, it permits the residential use, so therefore access for that permitted use is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| Mr. Davis, this is Commissioner Nostrom with a question again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| Al, it just, it's a tight choke point right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| So it looks like you've gotten the easement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| I mean, Mr. Snowden, I know we're not going to get drill down deep on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| I just want to, is that going to be wide enough if everything goes through with the easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| that you've got there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Yeah, that's kind of, I went out and full disclosure here and you love these awkward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1371)|
| 0:22:58| meetings here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| I'm old friends with Mr. Hilton and I'm old friends with Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| So both are very old friends of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| So I want to be fair to both of them on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| Mr. Hilton is a lot older than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| Don't put me on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| Hey, you're older than me too, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| I think we're the same vintage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| I think you're wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| I'm probably the only one that recognizes your football number from high school in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| email address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| So Cliff had called me Friday and had some questions about it and I did drive out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| and meet him Saturday morning just to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| And the tight point was really, as Mr. Hilton had mentioned in his emails, you kind of got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| And I know when you look at the property on the maps there, it almost reminded me if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| were to take two rectangles and put them together, you'd only let the rectangles touch at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| very tip corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| That's kind of what the access is like where you've got just a little bitty access point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| So I guess I'd like to get Mr. Snowden's take or just anybody with the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| I mean, that's just a tight access point that made me want to kind of question and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| verify that this could be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| I mean, generally speaking, when this body receives something from the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| with a unanimous vote and frankly, relatively low density, I mean, this is anything below| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1454)|
| 0:24:21| three and a half is, if you look at most of the stuff that comes through here, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| on the low side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| So the issue is this is really access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| And I think Mr. Hilton, you had mentioned to me some current concerns about the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| of sight on this one as it gets built up potentially on the slope on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| I guess, Scott, if you could talk a little bit more in detail about what that access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| point would potentially look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| And I know that we're just talking about the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| And Mr. Hilton, what was your concern I know about potential view sites on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1492)|
| 0:25:00| I just want to make sure that some of that stuff has been talked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| And I don't want to speak for Mr. Snowden, but as I understand, with a private road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| the minimum requirement is 40 feet for your right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| Okay, Mr. Snowden, are you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| And actually, we have 40 feet from the parcel number three, as Mr. Hilton stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1519)|
| 0:25:27| And then there's 10 feet from their property, at least 10 feet from their property over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| to the adjacent parcel, which is Mrs. Hobson's, which is another, so that actually technically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| adds up to 10, I mean, 50 feet of right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| You take in the 40 feet from parcel number three and the 10 feet separating parcel three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| from parcel 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| And I've met with Mrs. Hobson probably, I don't know, probably 10 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| And she's very much aware of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| I've met with her and her daughter and her son and her kids and her cats and her dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| I've met with them many, many, many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| And so they're very familiar with what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Jim, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| I concur with Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| I haven't looked at the topography out there in great detail, but 40 feet of right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| should be sufficient and is sufficient in most instances to put a 26 foot wide public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Scott, I was going to ask is, are you proposing this to be a private street or a public street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| If we can't get 50 feet, then we would make it private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| If we can get 50 feet, then we would make it public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| Good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| And by the way, Chairman and Commissioners, I believe that the access could be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| through a 40 foot right of way or easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| Commissioner Skinner-Maker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| That was kind of my question that Jim had answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| So in other words, would it from Blue Grass Road into the choke point, would that be accepted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1625)|
| 0:27:13| by Knox County at the present time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1633)|
| 0:27:20| In the small triangle area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| Commissioner Skinner-Maker, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| If Scott does build it to our standards, we would accept that as a public street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| But then if the next part, if he cannot get 50 feet, that portion would be a private road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1654)|
| 0:27:43| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| We have granted variances in right of way for certain sections, especially a section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1664)|
| 0:27:51| like that where you have limited space between it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| I think that a right of way of 40 foot could be granted for a public road in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| Any other commissioners have any follow-up questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| I'll grant Mr. Helton any other comments or follow-up or questions that you might have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| I mean, it's clear that that it's not a concern for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1699)|
| 0:28:26| It seems like it, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| It sounds like neither of those pieces of property will have to be rezoned, either the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| parcel number three or 111 through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| Did I understand that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| I guess the other comment that I would make is that, and I realize Mr. Davis has had trouble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1730)|
| 0:28:56| he added the 3H late in the game, that may have been part of his delay in or having to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1736)|
| 0:29:03| postpone and trying to work out what he was going to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| But I do think it's interesting that somewhat that the citizenry, and again, I'm speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| as Knox County citizen here, that you can receive notice on January the 25th, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1751)|
| 0:29:20| was the post date on the original card that I received and essentially received nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1760)|
| 0:29:27| else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| And I realized my access to this is from Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| So I don't go to, on Bluegrass Road, if I had not been paying attention with a card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1772)|
| 0:29:38| that was received on the 25th, I've got 460 feet that borders this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| I'm probably as effective as anybody, I'm not trying to, as far as a square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| standpoint, I realize everyone is important there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| But the fact that in four months, we're four months down the road, and clearly the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1796)|
| 0:30:04| a week before this meeting, there was no signage up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| And what I'm understanding is that that's not even required, which was not my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| But I think the commissioners, I would ask the commissioners, you need to look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| process if that is indeed the case, the advertising process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1817)|
| 0:30:24| I mean, I can, to your points, and Commissioner Schoonmaker, I'll get to you in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| I know when I went out there, I accessed the property via Bluegrass Drive, and there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| something that looked like a small power station that was behind, there were a utility connector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| on the little island there that had some fencing around it, and the signs weren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| I don't know if it had been mowed since then or something, and the mower had put them in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| But at least when we went out there Saturday, all three signs were there, but they had not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| they weren't out on the front-facing road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| Go ahead, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| Director Green, so basically, is it about 47 acres total for this project with all three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1859)|
| 0:31:11| parcels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| I think that's approximately correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| Okay, so we're looking at roughly 160 plus homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| That's correct, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| I would ask that for Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| I thought this was 23 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Is that not a concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| I think it's 22.67, or I don't know the exact number, but it's not 47 acres, it's 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1892)|
| 0:31:40| Well, the next file is 17 acres, and the following file is another five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1900)|
| 0:31:47| So if you add that together, doesn't the three parcels come to about 47 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| Or is that just not filed correctly with the NPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| So how many, I guess the question would be, is how many homes are you anticipating for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| the total three parcels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Let me, I can calculate the acreage real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| I may be incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| You want to stick around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| Yeah, I should have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| Mr. Davis, aren't you subdividing that nine-acre track out of a larger piece, the 3H?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1934)|
| 0:32:21| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Mr. Schoonmaker, I see you talking to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| I was just, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| Just how many, on the total project, how many homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1951)|
| 0:32:38| Yeah, I'm showing approximately 22.6 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1958)|
| 0:32:57| So is that 77 homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1977)|
| 0:33:06| Your math, I don't have a calculator here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| So whatever, you know, I think 22.63, I think may be the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| And we agreed on a compromise to the 3.45, as was stated by Mr. Green earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| So just so I have it clear then, so for the total of the three applications that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2000)|
| 0:33:27| hearing tonight, it's a total of about 78 homes, or what do you say, 22.7 acres total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2007)|
| 0:33:36| for the three filings here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| Whatever the math is, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| I do want to get a motion on the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| As we recall, we've discussed in great detail items 5051 and 52, as they're all pertaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2038)|
| 0:34:07| to the same property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| Go ahead, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2048)|

| 0:48:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission. The Planning Commission recommended that I voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| 11 to 0 on the consent agenda to recommend approval of the PR plan residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| for this 14.25-acre parcel and the density of five dwelling units an acre, finding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| that density would be compatible with the sector plan designation and also with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| surrounding development pattern. All right. Thank you. Is the applicant present? Mr. Kirby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2937)|

| 0:49:11| All right. And once again, I must reference that I had spoke to Drisilla right before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2951)|
| 0:49:19| meeting to find out if there was any opposition and she had not been contacted by any. Otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| they would have been invited to speak. And Mr. Kirby, if you don't mind, could you please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2963)|

| 0:49:36| All right. Thank you very much. Okay. I'm not seeing any opposition. I would like to get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| motion on this one. Commissioner Beeler? All right. Commissioner Beeler, your microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do have a question for Mr. Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| Mr. Kirby, I've looked at your, I think I've seen your site plan on this. Is 43, 44 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2992)|
| 0:49:59| is that what you're planning? Yes, sir. I think we ended up with 45 with a common area lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=2999)|
| 0:50:06| Okay. Somewhere in that neighborhood. Yeah. And I'm just trying to do the math on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| just for the reason I believe it's 14 acres, correct? Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3010)|
| 0:50:18| Yeah. So that works out to 3.21 or something like that. Yeah. I'm going to make a motion on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3018)|
| 0:50:26| Mr. Chairman. I think this is an appropriate development. I think Mr. Kirby's done a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| job on the density. I think it'll be relatively low impact. And this part of Beeler Road's already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| seen some improvements made in recent years. I'm not comfortable with the density that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| Planning Commission is recommending on this. I think it's way too aggressive for the Harbison's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3044)|
| 0:50:51| Crossroads area and the collector roads that, the shape they're currently in. And so I am going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3051)|
| 0:50:58| make a motion that we approve this zoning change per the Planning Commission's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| but at a density of 3.25 units per acre. I think that is a better precedent to set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3063)|
| 0:51:11| Second. Biggs. Okay. So we have a proper motion on the floor to accept the zoning recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3071)|
| 0:51:18| but a density of 3.25. That was made by Commissioner Beeler and seconded by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3078)|
| 0:51:24| Biggs. So that is what we have on the floor. Discussion. I've got both Commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3084)|
| 0:51:30| and Anderson Smith have weighed in. So Commissioner Anders first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| Yeah. I just wanted to, before we rezone somebody's property at a different than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| the application and recommendation, I want to make sure that they're okay with it at that 3.25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3097)|
| 0:51:45| Yeah. Yes. I think we're okay with that. We ran the first concept plan. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3105)|
| 0:51:54| a creep back there in the very back. We didn't intend to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| cross that. We pulled that back in. I think we're comfortable with that number, the 3.25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3119)|
| 0:52:07| Okay. Sounds good. All right. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Director Green. Sir, what is the subdivision to the north of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3131)|
| 0:52:18| zone? That and the subdivision, I guess, would be to the east of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3138)|

| 0:52:38| you guys. We're moving so fast. I went on to the next agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3158)|

| 0:53:05| Oh, yes, sir. It's one to five. And then one to three to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3185)|
| 0:53:11| there is a vacant piece of land and that subdivision is actually...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| No, it does come in down there. I just wonder if we put it at 3.25, do we in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3194)|
| 0:53:26| hinder any of the properties that are further south? And I can see doing this property with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3206)|
| 0:53:32| the creek in the back and it is a... Looks like it's going to be a thermometer type subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| one road in. Just do we leave the surrounding landowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3217)|
| 0:53:44| bound to the 3.25? Because I think in this area, you know, a 3.5 is more appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| even if this one can't be developed at that. We look at each property rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3230)|
| 0:53:57| on an individual basis and look at the characteristics. We do look somewhat at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| the surrounding properties, but in this area, there's some one to five, one to three. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3241)|
| 0:54:09| a range. And we're also becoming very aware of the need for higher density to address the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3249)|
| 0:54:15| housing needs of the county. So, I don't think it would have an adverse impact on these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| Okay. Thank you, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3260)|

| 1:00:08| Well, right now, it's under lease for a recycling and salvage center, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3608)|
| 1:00:14| what it's been used for for years. So, I don't think there's going to be any change in the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3614)|

| 1:00:31| Yeah. I saw the recycling down there. There wasn't. It just showed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3631)|

| 1:01:05| with the roll call vote on this. But back to you, Mr. Mullins. I guess at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3665)|

| 1:05:26| the reason for approving this, when I looked at it, it looked like two normal lots. It's because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3926)|
| 1:05:34| the sector plan and the rural growth area didn't take into account that there are substandard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3934)|

| 1:06:09| or there's a lot that's 1.9 acres that the owner wants to subdivide into two lots. And we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3969)|
| 1:06:16| using, fortunately, we have the rural residential sector plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=3976)|

| 1:15:17| So I'm not seeing anyone who'd like to weigh in again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| So Madam Clerk, would you please conduct a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4520)|

| 1:16:17| I just want to say to my colleagues, I truly hope that we can meet in the same room again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4577)|
| 1:16:22| for our next meetings. The efficiency of this is not great. And also, we have some commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4582)|
| 1:16:31| that are going to be going off on commission. And I think it would be good. And also, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4591)|
| 1:16:36| think it's best for the public if we can all get back to meeting in person. So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4596)|
| 1:16:42| we should do everything in our power to make sure that from this point going forward, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4602)|
| 1:16:48| if at all possible, we meet in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| Yeah, I totally, Commissioner Smith, I totally agree. I mean, maybe you could call it a novelty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| but that first meeting, I think we're all, nobody knew exactly what was going on. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| I got to tell you, this has been a, I guess, a necessary, but big time pain in the neck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| I'm so ready to move on, I got to tell you. So, and then somebody, I'm just curious, whose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4627)|
| 1:17:12| cat was it that we were hearing in the meeting earlier tonight? I'm just really curious if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| anybody wants to own that. I heard the cat. Was that you, Richie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| I think it's Gerald Green's cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| It was. I have an old cat that parks on these and has a voice to go with it in public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4641)|
| 1:17:29| Oh, that's funny. All right. Let's see, Commissioner Smith. All right, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4649)|
| 1:17:38| I just want to take a second just to recognize the historic moment of tonight. There was no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| zonings in District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| Wow. Wow. Wow. You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4666)|
| 1:17:53| Does that mean all the land's gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| Yeah. Okay. Commissioner Bussell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| Yes. I want to make an announcement, especially for Mr. Anders. We're getting real close to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4678)|
| 1:18:03| that senior living open up. If you come by this next month or so, they're selling those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4683)|
| 1:18:08| units right now. And I've got you on the agenda at the state level to where we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4688)|
| 1:18:13| make a crossing across Emory Road to where you can get to our Brewster's ice cream and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4693)|
| 1:18:21| Wild Boar Inn. So you won't have to walk that far. And we are making it handicap accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4701)|
| 1:18:30| for the future for you also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| I think I'll stake in my senior apartments out in my district. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4712)|
| 1:18:38| Okay. Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| Brad, you are about half his age, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| Yeah. There's some zoning math right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| Yes, because Commissioner Bussell had a birthday just a few weeks ago. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4728)|
| 1:18:56| anyway, yes, I just wanted to take a chance to congratulate the Fout City Man and Woman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4736)|
| 1:19:03| of the Year, Courtney Shea and Mark Campin. And I just want to congratulate them and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4743)|
| 1:19:11| echo what Randy Smith said. I miss seeing everybody and I'm thankful we've been able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4751)|
| 1:19:17| to continue the work for the county and our citizens. But there's nothing like being there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4757)|
| 1:19:25| in person and sharing the other little quirks and all that we like to aggravate each other with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4765)|
| 1:19:35| True. All right. Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| Carson and Beggs. All right, Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| Just wanted to confirm with our law department to make sure we've done everything correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| It seems correct to me, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4788)|
| 1:19:55| Thanks, Daniel. Okay. Commissioner Beggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I meant to ask this earlier. Tonight, we talked about a plaque| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| that's going to be presented. Is there a date for that and when it's going to be done as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4804)|
| 1:20:11| are we going to get invitations and things of that nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| Yeah, I don't know the details. I just recall what we talked about at the work session that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4814)|
| 1:20:20| there'll probably be a date to be determined, probably by that department that brought that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| to us. So, I'm sure once they get their date squared away. And it's also a certain balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| I think, what we're in phase two. So, they want to try to keep the gatherings at 50 or below. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4831)|
| 1:20:36| I know that that may bear a little bit in mind of, you know, you count the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4836)|
| 1:20:43| the mayor's group and all that, how many folks may want to be there. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| I don't want to put words in their mouth, but I don't have a date for it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| Okay. Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to echo and honor all of our Knox County seniors that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4856)|
| 1:21:02| graduating and moving to the next phase of their lives. I know this is really a significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4862)|
| 1:21:08| milestone for them. And I just wanted to make sure they are acknowledged that we are paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4868)|
| 1:21:14| attention to their upcoming graduation ceremonies. And if we meet in person next month, I actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4874)|
| 1:21:20| like to have some sour cream and onion potato chips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4880)|
| 1:21:26| Whatever you wish, Commissioner Gill, we'll get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what they've upgraded with the food from downstairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| but I think some of us may want to spring on something nicer for dinner when we come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| together, speaking for myself. So, all right. That's it. Just a couple little housekeeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4896)|
| 1:21:43| items. As I said, it's our intent that we'll get back together for a more traditional meeting next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| month. As Mr. Harrod mentioned earlier, that the mayor is going to be making, having a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4908)|
| 1:21:54| announcement next week. And, you know, one question we want to find out will be, and I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4914)|
| 1:22:00| probably need to follow up with Brian as I'm sure they'll probably be sending out a press release| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| with the details on the when and where. Randy, you're up there in the office. I don't know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| you might have more details, but I know that that'll probably be a video presentation. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| I know that the mayor's office, after announcing it to us tonight, I'm sure there'll be a follow-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| news release on it. And as mentioned at the last meeting, you know, our plans will be, we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4939)|
| 1:22:26| our regularly scheduled meetings in the 3rd and 4th, and a plan to vote on the budget by the 5th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4946)|
| 1:22:33| meeting, by the 5th Monday of June. So, that's kind of what I'm rolling with. And I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4953)|
| 1:22:39| has everybody said everything? I just don't know. I can see Brad, Carson, and Justin still got their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| blue hands raised up. Anything else? Okay. We are dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200526-zoning?start=4963)|
