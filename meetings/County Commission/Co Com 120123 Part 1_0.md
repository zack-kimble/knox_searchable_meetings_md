| 0:03:23| What is the status of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| I have to have a certificate of occupancy for a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| I'm going to provide Travis with an architectural drawing that I thought would have been finished last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=209)|
| 0:03:38| I have proceeded on with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=218)|

| 0:04:00| Hopefully in the next several days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| Until such time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| Because you're in a variant situation, until such time as you get your liquor by the drink license approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| and all these other documentations, this commission cannot legally issue you a license, just so you're aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Can we do a pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Is that legal or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=261)|

| 0:04:56| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=296)|

| 0:04:59| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| Mr. Tragressor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| And to each of you who are appearing up here today, please see the young lady in the back waving her hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| She has a package for you before you leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| Sir, are you counsel for these folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| You'll have to go to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| I'll need you to get before the microphone and state your name and your reason here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| My name is Chris Lindsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| I borrow rent from these people, and I was told at the beer board that I could answer some questions for them because their English is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=326)|
| 0:05:32| not too good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| And you speak their language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| But they, it's, I've been around them a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| I went over the questions with them that they were going to ask you, that you were going to ask them today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=345)|
| 0:05:51| And I'm involved in helping them get an open their other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| So let's see how this goes because she has to at least understand the nature of what we're doing because there are legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| requirements that she's going to have to adhere to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| Good afternoon, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| Make sure she speaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| Could you tell us your name, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| Denuka Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| And can you tell us your business address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| Denny's Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| 1203 Asheville, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| 1203 Asheville Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=386)|
| 0:06:32| My concern is this, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| Is there someone that I presume that in their family who is fluent in English who can actually translate accurately for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=396)|
| 0:06:46| Not at this time, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| Because that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| Only because she has to understand fully the implications of what she's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| You can't translate for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| And the problem is these are very strict and severe state laws for which, you know, excessive, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| severe penalties can be assessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| If she is, in other words, doesn't follow the rules and regulations, she has to be able to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=424)|
| 0:07:11| We're going to be asking questions about criminality, about licensure, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| And, you know, the problem is you're putting the commission in a position where do they knowingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| and intelligently issue a beer license to her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| Well, sir, we're not trying to do that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| We're trying to get a pending one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| But she has attended the classes that are required by the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| So she has a beer permit or a service permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| Wolfie's got something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| Wolfie, what you got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| I was up at this location, and it looks like it's under remodeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| It's the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| It looks like they had a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| And it's not going to look like it's going to be ready any time like in the next month or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=474)|
| 0:08:03| Would that sound accurate to you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| I mean, this is not an open, viable business at this point, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| In all fairness to these people, again, because you don't want to put her in a position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| these people in a position where they get this license, they don't understand the ramifications of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| and then the sheriff's department shows up at their doorstep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| I just feel that we can just keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| I'm going to defer to the wisdom of the commission on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| but I'd be a lot more comfortable if in 30 days they brought someone back who can actually translate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| so they knowingly and intelligently enter into what they're doing is an agreement with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| especially now that it's not like it's an open, viable business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| It makes sense, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| But I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| I'm wondering, the University of Tennessee, I'm sure, would have someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| or they may know someone that could translate next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| Her son will be back in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| I think the safe thing for the commission and for the citizen is to do it in 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| By then they'll probably have further progression because the most the commission would do today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| even if there was no fluency issue, was pending completion of all these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| which will be another month anyway, so there's no detriment to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| But there is a detriment giving them a license that's enforceable by state and criminal law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| and that's a danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| But, again, you know, if the commission is comfortable going forward, I'll defer to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| but I'd caution against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| Mr. Chairman, I'd move that we defer until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| I also have a question for Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| Wolfie, is this test, maybe you can answer, I don't know where she took the test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| but are they given in languages other than English for the server test?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=583)|
| 0:09:51| Are they available in other than English?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| I'm not so sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| You know, we talk about this, you know, on the Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| and I'm not so sure that all of the intricacies of the laws are being transmitted in a proper way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=602)|
| 0:10:19| The class that I went to was only in English,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| so I've never heard anyone mention anything about a different language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| Well, that's something we need to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| You know, I think you can start down this road, but I'd also say the literacy rate in East Tennessee should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=635)|
| 0:10:42| called into question, and, you know, I think we have a solution to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| There's a person that's going to be here next month, but starting to question understanding of coursework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=648)|
| 0:10:56| and retention, quizzes, and I think we're treading into ground that we really don't want to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=656)|
| 0:11:07| We have a really good enforcement program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| We have a really good training program, and when those two, you know, don't meet, if they didn't hear it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| they'll be selling some Bud Light to someone, and then we'll be bringing them in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| I think that the program works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| Let's not start micromanaging and questioning every aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| I think the law director actually applauded him for picking that out and pointing that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=685)|
| 0:11:31| and it sounds like we've got a path forward, and I think we need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Did you want to make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| They already have a beer permit in another location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| But right now what's before us is this permit in this location, so 30 days if you can come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| That's what the board, if the commission actually votes and says 30 days, just have them come back 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=707)|
| 0:11:55| with the son or someone else who can translate in both languages, and we should be in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| Motion on the floor is to defer until our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| We'll see you next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=728)|

| 0:12:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| So you'll have to, when we're done with the colloquy and once we determine what the commission decides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| we'll need to have you surrender that previous beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=764)|

| 0:12:46| I'm going to ask you a series of questions, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| I ask you to kindly answer aloud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=767)|

| 0:12:54| sale, manufacture or transportation of intoxicating liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| or a crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=778)|

| 0:13:09| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| And what is your relation to the property owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| I'll be leasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| You'll be leasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| Does anyone else have an interest in the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| So you'll be the sole proprietor operator?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Are you familiar with the Knox County and Tennessee Beer Laws and Regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| And do you agree to conduct your business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=805)|

| 0:13:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| I'm going to defer now to our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| Foods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| Less than 500 feet to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| Have you applied for a liquor by the drink license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| Does it currently have a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| How long has that been in effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| To my knowledge, five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| The law does provide that if there has been a preexisting beer permit at that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| that the law favors them receiving a permit regardless of our zoning requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| Fire Marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=844)|
| 0:14:10| Can you speak into the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| There was a few items that needed to be addressed on the last inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| so just pending a re-inspection and the correction of those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| For the record, we have corrected each item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| We're just waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=863)|

| 0:14:29| We're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| Pending these requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=881)|

| 0:15:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| Will you both operate the business or just you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| Yes, we will both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| Are you familiar with the Knox County and Tennessee beer laws and regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| And do you agree to conduct your business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Do you have a server training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Did you complete a server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| Yes, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| So I'm now going to defer to our staff health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| Sheriff's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=959)|

| 0:16:03| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=966)|

| 0:16:08| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| It's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| Bill, if you can hang around a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| You know, we're trying to work on getting access into your parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| The people from the they may be here in 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| And I'd like to introduce them to you if we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| And the mayor will possibly be here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| You wanted to meet him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=988)|

| 0:17:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1032)|

| 0:17:54| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| We do have a quorum present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| As I mentioned, this is the public forum section of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| And we have Mr. Matt Morlock who has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| Mr. Morlock, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| If you'd give us your name and address of the record, please, and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| My name is Matt Morlock, 411 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| I live here downtown on the other end of the street here in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| And I'm here to discuss the hotel and motel tax, as stated on the agenda, and its current allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1098)|
| 0:18:25| The sole recipient or the major go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| Could I ask you a question before you get started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Did you want to talk about this now or when we kind of was it in connection with sports and tourism?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| I wanted to do exactly what you tell me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| No, I'm just, it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| Mr. Chair, I think we've given folks an opportunity to talk about it when the issue comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| We are going to have a discussion item on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| You can address this now or you can wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| That was changed on the agenda during the luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| I'm prepared to talk right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| And I don't have too many surprises to give you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| Well, we're going to start your five minutes now, so you'll have your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| We're dealing with four plus million dollars of annual hotel-motel tax revenue, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| according to the information that I saw on the Knox County website when I was looking just last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| And the sole recipient, the person who's going to speak later on today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1154)|
| 0:19:20| who we all heard speak just now in the luncheon, Gloria Ray, the recently famous CEO of that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1160)|
| 0:19:29| She's famous because of what most people have come to believe is a grotesque overcompensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| for the job that she does for the Knoxville Tourism and Sports Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1173)|
| 0:19:39| I'm not here to say that they do a bad job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| I'm here to say that they are not the only ones who are working to drive tourism in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| I believe that there are so many other organizations, non-profits, culture-driving organizations in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| who very handsomely deserve a much more significant portion of that revenue whenever you make your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1192)|
| 0:19:59| and whenever you consider who gets that money in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| Let me introduce myself first, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| I am the aforementioned guitar repair shop owner on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| I have a shop called Morlock Music at 411 Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| I host concerts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| I do repair and sell instruments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| We have a music school there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| I'm also the former host of the aforementioned WDVX Blue Plate Special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| I was there for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| I was at WDVX Radio for a dozen years before leaving to open my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| As the host of that show, our little stage is on the ground floor of the Knoxville Visitor's Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1228)|
| 0:20:38| I mean, the One Vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| No, I mean the Gloria Ray Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| That's what it's called now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| Nice little plaque out front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| Real pretty plaque.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| Looks expensive, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| And I remember starting that show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| KTSC's corporate policy for my conduction of that show was to use the equipment that they provided for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1253)|
| 0:21:01| in putting on a live music performance, microphones, stands, speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| all of them of extremely subpar quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| I ended up having to use a bunch of my personal equipment conducting that show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| being told time and time again that KTSC could not afford upgrading that equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| A cursory look just at the parking situation outside of the Knoxville Visitor's Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| where the employees have twice the reserved parking that the visitors to Knoxville have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1285)|
| 0:21:32| to me speaks to where their priorities lie and how they allocate their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| Gloria's insistence in the previous meeting may hold some water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| They've decided to concentrate their funding on personnel rather than advertising Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1302)|
| 0:21:49| which is their mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| And she also provided a whole lot of numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| It's really exciting and inspiring to see how much more tourist-friendly Knoxville has become,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| how many more people visit here than visited here before KTSC became the large conglomerate that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1321)|
| 0:22:08| I think it is a supreme fallacy to believe that KTSC is the sole organization responsible for that increase in tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1328)|
| 0:22:17| I think they do a wonderful job at bringing in conventions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| I think they do a wonderful job at promoting sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| I think they do a not-so-wonderful job of networking with the grassroots communities, the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1343)|
| 0:22:30| the nonprofit organizations, the entertainers, and the arts organizations in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1350)|
| 0:22:36| that also, in my opinion, drive tourism and in actually the opinion of most of the people I've spoken with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1356)|
| 0:22:42| when they find out that I'm coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| Then, taking all the credit, I think it speaks to a kind of a level of disconnectedness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| and arrogance in conducting their business and in justifying their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| They are nice people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1377)|

| 0:23:00| It's really actually nerve-wracking and difficult for me to stand here and be saying this to you right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| because I smile at each of them when I see them on the street on the rare occasion that they've not chosen to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| in the back door of the Gloria Ray building to go into their office to avoid the crowds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1390)|

| 0:23:49| with almost every single decision that we made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| Most of you hopefully are familiar with WDVX and why people come to visit Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| largely from my experience from music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1435)|

| 0:24:01| I direct people to hotels all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1441)|

| 0:24:14| I'd simply ask for a calm and intelligent reconsideration of the hotel-motel tax revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| who gets it, why they get it, and whether or not they actually drive tourism here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1460)|

| 0:29:37| I'd also like to add just a brief item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| I was going to go over some housekeeping things with the commission, and we ran out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| I'd like to add that to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| These are not amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| And I do not, if item 402 and 403 remain on consent, that's okay with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1789)|
| 0:29:57| I just would like to say that Commissioner Norman and I were in a public meeting concerning these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1797)|
| 0:30:04| two agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| That meeting was not sunshined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| He stood in one corner and I stood in the other corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| I didn't even really know he was there until the meeting had been going on for about 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| Also, I'd like to say that on January the 9th, at an unsunshined meeting of the junior league,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| I ran into Commissioner Schaust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| I applaud him for other several meetings that I ran into him this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| On the 14th at Wright's Cafeteria, I encountered Smith and Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| On the 18th at Calhoun's, I encountered Jeff Oinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1837)|
| 0:30:44| And this morning, the governor speaking here locally happened at a meeting here downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1844)|
| 0:30:54| Commissioner Smith, Schaust, and Brown, at least I saw those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| And all of these meetings were not sunshined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| and none of them did I discuss anything related to Knox County politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| There is one thing that I believe will be something major with us later on today that I'll come back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1866)|
| 0:31:13| on the governor's, out of the governor's speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| Point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| If I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Oh, go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| I was going to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| Was any of the Commissioner Wright's declarations necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| Well, I think, you know, we always err in favor of disclosing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| But under the Tennessee Open Meetings Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| those are all within the confines of the Open Meetings Act known as chance meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| So none of those would have required to be sunshined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| This really has to do with the zoning meeting about an item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| If we want to talk about it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| we may be able to let some folks know that we're traveling down here if we decide to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| But it really deals with the ordinance on billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| You know, this came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| It was placed on here by the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| And just to be absolutely fair to all parties is that neither the billboard people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1928)|
| 0:32:16| nor the general public have had an opportunity to really reflect on this very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1936)|
| 0:32:23| This is something that's really pretty big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| And I would really like to defer this for at least 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| and let us have a public hearing on this before we vote on this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1949)|
| 0:32:36| Mr. Law Director, since this is on the agenda for zonings, can we take it up now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| I mean, the problem is the public's on notice that it's set for 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| You'd have to, in all fairness, at 6 p.m. announce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| I was just trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| My purpose for this is nothing other than trying to say people coming down here pay $8 for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| They bring in all their people and then say, sorry, we're not going to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| That was my reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| No, it's admirable, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| I just think the problem is someone could claim that they didn't give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| or weren't given proper notice and opportunity and were aggrieved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| Do I hear a motion that we add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| I'm sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| I just want to do one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| I just want to do, speaking of disclosure, on page 3 of your agenda, R12-1-501,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| there is a resolution relative to the YWCA and grant funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| and I just think the commission should know that the director of the YWCA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| Mary Gail Mullen, is married to an attorney in my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| Of course, as you'll see by the grant, there is no personal benefit for either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| but just an abundance of caution, I wanted you to be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| Yes, in regards to Commissioner Briggs' comment, I know we can't do it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| but I think this serves to put those who might be coming down tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| that might be listening to the fact that they can be assured that it will be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| We can't legally do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| No, we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| I know we can't do it, but we can say we're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| Well, we don't know if we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| You don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Give me a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| So, I would like to just have a couple of questions on 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2053)|
| 0:34:20| So, I don't know if we need to pull that for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| I know it's on education consent with schools, but I do have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| Do you want to pull it off consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| So, do I hear a motion that we add what needs to be added and deferred what needs to be deferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| and change what needs to be changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| Next item is drives and roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| Any drives and roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| Line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| Do I hear a motion that they be approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| They are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| How many notary applications do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| 171.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| 171.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Do I hear a motion that they be approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| They are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| If it's okay, commissioners, if we could go ahead and do 201 while the superintendent is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| You said you had a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| If that's okay, if we could go ahead and read item 201 into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| 201, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| approving a contract in the amount of $15,511,500 with Rouse Construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| for the construction of the new Southwest Sector Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| Yes, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| And my question is probably more so for Mr. Dillingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| I'm just wanting to, you know, pretty much a good news report, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| I just wanted to know what you all ended up with in terms of what this money is going to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| in terms of square footage, what the student population, max student population that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2150)|
| 0:35:57| present building is going to end up in, and then also, is there any room for growth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| I just wanted just to, you know, in this public way, just kind of just talk about high level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| what this school is, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| Thank you, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| Jim McIntyre, superintendent of schools, 912 South Gate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| I will ask Mr. Dillingham to give you an overview of the building, the new Southwest Sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2176)|
| 0:36:23| Elementary School, and he can give you some details on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| I did just want to note that this item was on education consent and procedurally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| I'm not sure that it should be or can be taken off the consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| but that's, I suppose, the business of the commission to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| It is, we're excited about the new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| We're excited about moving forward, and it's a, I think, a wonderful design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2205)|
| 0:36:52| It's very similar to Gibbs Elementary School and also the new Carter Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| It's about 129,000 square feet and will serve about 1,200 students in the southwest area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2219)|
| 0:37:06| of the county where we know we are going to have lots of growth over the next several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| So I think it's a great design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Copen Associates was the architect, and we look forward to a very aggressive construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| schedule that we believe will allow us to open the new school in the fall of 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| I'll defer to Mr. Dillingham on any other details or information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2244)|
| 0:37:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| Doug Dillingham, Supervisor of Facilities and Construction, Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| 912 South K Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| I think the only question that wasn't answered has to do with future expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| and at this point in time, we have been directed by the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| from a size standpoint, that 1,200 students is the maximum size that we would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| for an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| So it is not planned to expand this one any farther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| What about geothermal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| Are we doing any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| This does include geothermal system similar to what was done at Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2289)|
| 0:38:16| It's not a full geothermal system, but all of the classrooms will have a geothermal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| The larger areas will still be using other means of HVAC systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2302)|
| 0:38:29| and it was simply because we were attempting to reuse a design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| and if you're going to go totally geothermal on a system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| you have to know that on the front end and design for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| It takes quite a few larger areas to incorporate the HVAC systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| Mr. Chairman, if I could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| what the school superintendent was referring to is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| as you're aware with the order of consent with the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| unless an item is unfunded or illegal, it stays on the educational consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| So there's a difference between discussing an item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| and actually pulling it from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| It should remain on the consent agenda unless there's no funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| or it hasn't been legally approved, and this had been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| So I guess, yeah, that's why I asked the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| So what is the process going forward when we have questions about things on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2358)|
| 0:39:24| So we would just ask to discuss them at what point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| Well, if it is funded, it is legal, and it has been approved, you approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| And thereafter, if you'd like to discuss it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| you're an open forum, you're an open government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| you can discuss things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| but it shouldn't be pulled from their consent agenda unless there's legal infirmity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| But it's hard to do that when we pass, I guess, 80% of these items are on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2384)|
| 0:39:50| Do we make it a discussion item at the end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| Do we do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| I'm just trying to figure out mechanically how that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| because right now we're going to go into another item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| And so do we wait until the end of the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| I'd hate to keep the educational staff here, so that was my driver for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| This is going to be one of the things that we're going to be talking about this weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| is how do we go through these procedural matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| I don't think anybody is going to vote against the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| You want to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| And so I just said, well, let's pull it so we can ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| It wasn't to pull it to perhaps vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| No, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| It was let's discuss it because you did have good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| And so it wasn't in any way intended to try to circumvent the school decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| And, Mr. Chairman, if I may, I'm always glad to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| You know, obviously we have a great partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| and a great working relationship with the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| And I'm always glad to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| I just noted a question procedurally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| And I appreciate the opportunity to provide information to the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| and to answer questions that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| Dr. McIntyre, before you leave, I wanted to publicly take note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| as you did on the state of the school's address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| the students at Gresham and the Beta Club and also the audiovisual from Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| Am I missing another group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| And we had culinary arts students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| Oh, the culinary arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Austin East and from South Doyle High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| You did a great job with the whole program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| I mean, it was well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| I just wanted to commend the students publicly, as you did Thursday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| They did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| They did a wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| We had student participation, as the Commissioner mentioned, in a variety of different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| We were just really proud of the work that they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| And it was great to have them involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| Thank you to all of those commissioners who were able to come on Thursday night for the state of the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| and to hear a pretty, I think, candid and honest assessment of where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| where we need to be for our children for the future, and how to bridge that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| Actually, I had had something that I was going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| but the comment I'm going to make now is that I've waited to be called upon by the Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| while other people have spoken without being called upon by the Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| So that's the only comment that I'm going to make right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| If we could move on to the reading of the consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| We don't have very many, so let's go ahead and read those into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| 301, approving the 2012 Appalachia High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, HIDTA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2535)|

| 0:44:23| Do I hear a motion that these consent items be approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| They are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| Resolution 121110, approving appointments to Knox County Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2677)|
| 0:44:45| Each of these need to be voted on separately, I believe, according to our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| So we're going to start with the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| If you would give us the name of your nominee, we will be voting on them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| If you have any questions, we'll be happy to answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| I talked with Mr. Rogers today, our election administrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| and he was saying to me that it might be aggressive to try to put items on the ballot by August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| because we have to approve them, the commission must approve them on two readings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| and we must have public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| So he was saying that November would probably be a more realistic date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| However, he certainly was not trying to dictate the work of the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| But just for our frame of mind and our frame of reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| that may be what we're looking at is a November as opposed to getting it on the ballot in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| So let's begin in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| Again, we need to vote on each of these individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| Commissioner McKenzie, do you have a nominee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| Keith Lindsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| I'll give a general statement about Mr. Lindsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| He's extremely active in the Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| He's a branch manager at Home Federal Bank, Sevier County, and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2750)|
| 0:45:57| He's a current president of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, an outstanding organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| which Dr. Martin Luther King was a proud member of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| They're very active locally in oratorical contests and scholarships and a myriad of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2767)|

| 0:46:16| So Keith Lindsey would be my nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| Do you want to put that in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| Yes, my nominee is Renee Hoyos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| And her letter of interest and resume were passed around to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| You all may remember Renee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| Mark Harmon nominated her to county BCA when we were doing that a couple years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2803)|
| 0:46:52| We actually ended up appointing Marcus Chatty from the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| And Renee is an excellent, excellent candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2816)|
| 0:47:02| And I'm very pleased and honored to be able to nominate her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2822)|
| 0:47:08| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| I'm going to nominate a lady who lives in Cumberland States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| who I've come to know quite well over the last seven, eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| And she's just been active in many political races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2847)|
| 0:47:35| And she's active in the Homeowners Association there in Cumberland States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| And she pays attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| And her name is Connie Hughes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| Commissioner Wanby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| I'm going to nominate Elaine Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| She's a former county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| And she's also the chairman of the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| And so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| Can she hold two appointments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| I don't know that she's a law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2889)|
| 0:48:15| Should we move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| I'd also like to point out that Renee is running for office right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| And I think it would be extremely inappropriate to appoint someone to this body who is currently running for elected office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2905)|
| 0:48:35| Is she running for school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| Running for school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| Let's hold yours, Commissioner Wanby, if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| Let's move on to Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| I'd like to nominate Craig Luthol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| I think everyone knows him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| He spent eight years as a county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| He's a certified public administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| And he's very familiar with problems with the charter because he's lived through many of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2931)|
| 0:48:58| And I make a motion to approve him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2942)|

| 0:49:05| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| My nomination will be Dr. David Page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| I sent you his resume last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| I think Joe Lee sent it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| Just a very intelligent, very well thought man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| And I think he'll do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| I make a motion to approve David Page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| Yeah, I have sent before you mentioned at the workshop, Bob Browntree, former commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| And his resume has already been sent to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| In the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| And it's been seconded by Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| Mr. Roundtree is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| I nominate Ann Douglas-Acoff, who stood before us last week being honored or last month or the month before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2986)|
| 0:49:55| Retired county employee with an immense organizational knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| Ms. Acoff is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| I move to nominate Ed Frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| We all have his bio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| Ed's a retired attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| And he's also served in an elected office, not in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| But he has had some experience in working with governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| Can you make that in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| And is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3023)|
| 0:50:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| Mr. Frame is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| Let's go back to Commissioner Orlenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| The question was Ms. Davis serving as both chair of the ethics committee and now on the charter review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3031)|
| 0:50:39| And currently running for public office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| There is no legal impediment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| You don't have any established rules that preclude that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| But, you know, commissioners, as one of these issues, is it a good idea as compared to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3047)|
| 0:50:54| or not there's legal infirmity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| You know, in terms of someone running for office, serving on the ethics committee, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| That's, you know, the question you'll have to ask yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| I can't tell you that, you know, there's a Tennessee code section that would preclude that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| I know that in the past you've talked about trying to limit people from serving on multiple boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| depending upon the availability of applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| But it's really a legislative decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| Yes, Commissioner Orlenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| I'll pull her name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| I mean, I sent the bio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| I don't know why nothing was brought up before now if there was a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| So I'll go ahead and pull her name and I'll nominate Barbara Pelo, former city council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| Now, she does serve on the foster care review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| I don't know if that's an issue or not, but I'll nominate her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| Ms. Pelo is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| Those are the nine representatives for the charter review for county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| Or is someone from the mayor's office here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| Yes, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| Mr. Chairman, while he's coming, is this a slate of appointments or do we have to vote on these ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3127)|
| 0:52:13| We will need to vote on these one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| I believe that's correct, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| In the interest of clarity, you should do each nominee because, again, each one merits a singular vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3138)|
| 0:52:24| Mr. Mayor, if you could give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| Tim Burchett, 6401 Ayrtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| And I believe that is 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| Do we have any records there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| We will be voting on each of these individually, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| So if you could tell us your nominee from District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| Ian Hennessey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| He is a young attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| He comes well recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| Do you want me to just go down the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| Are we going to individually talk about them and then vote on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| If we could vote on them one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3171)|

| 0:57:14| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| Will there be a chair of this committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| And do we know when the times yet will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| I just need to coordinate my schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| I'm traveling in February sometimes, and I want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| You will get the ideas would be you'd set a date to convene, and at that time, you would vote for a chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3446)|
| 0:57:33| and vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| At that first meeting, what I would do is charge the committee with the fact that it is, in fact, a sunshine board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3454)|
| 0:57:41| Who would set the date in that there are 27 people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| Well, I mean, the commission could set, you know, several dates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3465)|
| 0:57:52| or you can just set a date and see if you get a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| Would it be acceptable if I met with the mayor and set a date, set a couple of dates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3477)|
| 0:58:04| Because, I mean, we can talk about it here, but we don't have all 27 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| But maybe we can poll some people, and if it's acceptable, I'll meet with the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| and we'll set a date so they can convene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| They'll need to get ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| They'll need to get going pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| And then they can meet and select and organize and select a chair and so forth, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| Could you e-mail us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| If you're going to pick, say, four dates, you could e-mail us those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| We're going to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| Yes, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| So, you know, I guess associated with that, I'd like to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| since we've nominated 18 citizens, that we take that in consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3510)|
| 0:58:39| And I know we like to meet during the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| but I think it's pretty proven that evening meetings tend to draw more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| and we're asking these people to come and show up that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| that when you're talking with the mayor, that we take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| And it would be a mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| I'm not saying all meetings are at the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| but I think there needs to be a mix because we're asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| we're going to ask a pretty big favor of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| We will have a staffer call most of these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| or call everyone throughout some dates and see what would be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| I just wanted to make a comment on the process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| This, I see this Charter Review Committee as an opportunity for regular citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3558)|
| 0:59:28| to be more involved in the political process in a very meaningful way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| We've got 27 people on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| We've got nine commissioners right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| And I'm really disappointed to see so many what would be considered political insiders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| people who have held political office or worked for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3587)|
| 0:59:53| You know, we've tried, I think, really hard in the past few years to move towards more openness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3593)|
| 1:00:01| more citizen involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| And this is nothing at all against Barbara or Craig or Bob or Ann or John or Diane or any of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3603)|
| 1:00:12| These are all wonderful, wonderful people who would do a fabulous job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| a question they know a lot about government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| But I'm really disappointed that we have not done a better job of recruiting regular citizens to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3618)|
| 1:00:27| and sit on this very, very important committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| I'm also disappointed to not see more diversity in these appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3631)|
| 1:00:40| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| Where are we going to meet, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| Meet here in the main assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| These will need to be televised and sunshined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| I was wondering if Mr. Hennessey's resume had come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| If not, we can put that on hold and move on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| So if that's okay, commissioners, we'll put that on hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| We'll come back to that district one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| But let's move on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| And these are your discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| If I could, Mr. Chairman, just quickly, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| Just so you know, this committee has a duty to solicit input from the citizenry and from elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3672)|
| 1:01:20| The chart actually reads it as the duty of the Charter Review Committee to seek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| and give the ability to the general public and elected officials to come forward with information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3685)|
| 1:01:31| So when you have these meetings, the public will be noticed, given an opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| and encouraged to attend and submit their recommendations to that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| Mr. Mayor, did you get the information from Mr. Hennessey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3702)|
| 1:01:50| Before we move on, here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3710)|
| 1:01:57| Actually, Grant back there goes to church with him and knows him very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| He's in his mid-30s, which makes him a young man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| He goes to Church Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| He's with London and Berm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| He does primarily insurance work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3727)|
| 1:02:13| And I'm going to get you Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| They're running out right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| And the guy in the office that had all the information had left for a late lunch, and I apologize to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| It's totally my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| You know, that's and we can vote on them, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| But I guess, you know, I think every other district probably knew their person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| It sounds like a well-educated man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| I pulled him up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| He looked like a Vanderbilt grad, a University of Tennessee grad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| I didn't know he graduated from a two-year school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| I might have to reconsider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| So I guess I'm just, you know, torn with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| As the law director said, this person should be ingrained in his community or her community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3773)|
| 1:03:01| I'm pretty ingrained in the first district, and am I not knowing him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| I don't know how wide his circle is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| And, again, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| And that's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| And I'll also say, you know, ladies and gentlemen, we have minority candidates out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3794)|
| 1:03:22| All of your districts have minority candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| It bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| Sounds like a race call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| But I've been on this board a long time, and we're not seeing minority candidates out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| They're south, west, east, you know, and north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3816)|
| 1:03:43| So I feel sometimes I'm the vanguard for keeping diversity, and that shouldn't be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3823)|
| 1:03:49| I know there have been occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| I think the Ethics Committee, there was one person brought from another district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3830)|
| 1:03:56| But as we, you know, so when I'm looking at this, okay, so we got 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| Am I responsible for minority representation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| And Amy putting a Hispanic female on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| We're a diverse culture here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| We really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| I think we need to start embracing that and soliciting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| There are African-American churches in most of your districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| There are avenues to get people involved out there in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3861)|
| 1:04:28| And I've been holding this for, you know, the three years as I've seen appointments come and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3868)|
| 1:04:34| And, you know, I have a diverse constituency as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3874)|
| 1:04:40| I'm just now getting to where I'm over 50 percent African-American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| I think this last census, this last redistricting, the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| So I feel bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| We got downtown folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| This gentleman seems, you know, competent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| I don't, you know, how, again, I question his involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| But, you know, I'll just ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| And that's just a food for thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| You know, as we go forth, as we have these appointments and this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3902)|
| 1:05:07| maybe it may take a little more legwork because the numbers aren't as great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3907)|
| 1:05:13| But, you know, if year in, year out, Sam is the response, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3913)|
| 1:05:19| is the sole person that's going to appoint African-Americans, you know, that's limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3919)|
| 1:05:24| It's limiting for you, and it's limiting for me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| So at this point, we can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| You know, I'm probably not going to support this person merely because I don't know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3931)|
| 1:05:38| And I think that's unfair that I'm probably representing going to have the only person that I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| that, you know, you all probably know your other two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| You know, I don't disagree with anything that Sam says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| It's that I would, I believe we should have more diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| And the thing is, is that how do we get these people to come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| I know out where I did, we, you know, we had it in the papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| We had it this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| I took the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| Quite frankly, I got two names, two names, two people that said they would be willing to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| There's a variety of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| Sometimes people can't get off from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| The people that did come up in the fifth district are both people that have been involved in government before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| I would like to point out that one of the two is a woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| And she's a very good candidate, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3985)|
| 1:06:30| And, as a matter of fact, I have to admit I was gender blind when I picked them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| because I thought she was a very good person, you know, by her own rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| But I don't know, you know, how do you go about that trying to solicit people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=3997)|
| 1:06:42| We've put things out before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| You call people and they say they just don't have the time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| And I just want to bring that forward because I do believe, I agree with what you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4007)|
| 1:06:54| The mayor has put forth Ian Hennessey's name for district one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4020)|
| 1:07:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4022)|
| 1:07:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| We have two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| Mr. Hennessey is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| And procedurally, I believe that we need now to vote on all for the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| So do I hear a motion that all 27 names?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| So the Charter Review Committee is now set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| And, again, the mayor and I will poll people and set up a time for the initial meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| but we're going to try to do it sooner rather than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| We have three discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| One with the Knoxville Tourism and Sports Corporation, the Food Policy Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| and regarding Knox County's certification process and bonus policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| Commissioner Burroughs, the Food Policy Council was first on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| Are they here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| Yes, they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| If we could go ahead and get that presentation first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| I'd like to give a little introduction to the Food Policy Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| I've been serving on the Food Policy Council in my role as commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4075)|
| 1:08:02| and it's been an absolutely wonderful experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4082)|
| 1:08:09| I've learned a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| I've learned an awful lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| It's been a wonderful experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| I'm excited about things that are happening in Knoxville and Knox County around food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:22| And there's some really great things coming up, and I hope that you will all --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4102)|
| 1:08:30| Food is something that, you know, except when we're running to the grocery store, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| it's something that I -- not something that really we think very much about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| about where our food comes from or how important it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| And lots of times food is seen, I know, with busy families as a chore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| In fact, a friend of mine commented recently on -- had a comment on Facebook that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| gosh, these kids have to be fed every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| And it's true, but it's not something that we think much about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| And it's something that deserves more attention and more thought than we give it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4138)|
| 1:09:04| So I'm really, really excited to have members of the Food Policy Council here today to give you a very brief presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4144)|
| 1:09:12| one that I hope will be the first of several over the next year as we bring to you the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4152)|
| 1:09:19| exciting things that are happening in Knoxville around food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| Thank you, Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| My name is Stephanie Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| I live at 2137 Hillsborough Heights, and I work at the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| I'm here with my colleague, John Dickel, who's the Executive Director of Food and Nutrition for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4175)|
| 1:09:41| And we're here to share with you today a little bit about what the Food Policy Council is, what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4181)|
| 1:09:47| and kind of the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| So I'm going to let John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| John, that's John right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| John Dickel, 1530 Bexhill Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| John's going to advance slides for me, and then we're going to switch places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| So you may or may not have heard of the Knoxville-Knox County Food Policy Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| We are actually the first Food Policy Council, I can say certainly nationally, internationally, universally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4208)|
| 1:10:15| the first one ever established in 1982.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| So this is our 30th year, I guess our 31st year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| We started off as a Knoxville Food Policy Council, expanded in 2002 to include Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4222)|
| 1:10:29| And basically, we're here to keep our eye on the food system, everything from how food is grown and produced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4229)|
| 1:10:36| how it's processed, distributed, how it's sold, consumed, the health effects of that consumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4236)|
| 1:10:43| and every part along the process, as well as the waste, that food waste that's created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4243)|
| 1:10:50| So our purpose is, we're probably the only folks in Knox County that kind of keep our eye on that food system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4250)|
| 1:10:57| And our job is to make recommendations to policy makers such as yourself about the food system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4257)|
| 1:11:03| You hadn't heard from us in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| We've sort of been building internally, just like all organizations, go through wax and wane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4264)|
| 1:11:10| But for 30 years, we have been around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| We have 11 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| And John, if you could advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| Five are appointed by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| Six are appointed by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| And you can kind of take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| We do have a fairly diverse representation, both from gender, ethnicity, and we have some associate members as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4285)|
| 1:11:34| as well as just a variety of everything from the private sector, government sector, not-for-profit sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4294)|
| 1:11:42| John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| And we have been very active in recent years and just thought we wanted to share a little bit with you about what we've been working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4303)|
| 1:11:50| We have spent a lot of time kind of trying to understand what's going on around food in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4310)|
| 1:11:56| So, for instance, we partnered with the University of Tennessee Public Health Nutrition Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| who went out into Knox County and looked at each of the 12 planning sectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| took a very standardized sample of food from food retail outlets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| and found that the lowest income sector of our community pays $20 more for the same basket of food as the highest income sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4331)|
| 1:12:19| of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| So that's one issue that we're continuing to explore, and we'll talk about some of the future things we're doing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4340)|
| 1:12:26| We are very interested in getting people educated about where food comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| A lot of folks don't realize that the carrots that they buy in the store actually come out of the dirt in the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| So we're focused on community gardening, again, an issue that, you know, folks across the community are interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4356)|
| 1:12:44| We had a series of forums on community gardens, and from that we produced a community garden tool kit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4364)|
| 1:12:51| that's available on our website and that's been distributed throughout the community to help folks figure out not just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4371)|
| 1:12:58| nuts and bolts of getting their garden started, but how to deal with zoning codes and ordinances related to agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| and gardening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4384)|
| 1:13:05| We also have compiled a report that outlines the connection between our local food system and the local economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4385)|
| 1:13:13| and that's what Mr. Dickel is going to speak about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| So I'm going to turn it over to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| I thank you for your time today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4396)|
| 1:13:23| As Stephanie mentioned, the report that we compiled, Food Matters was the name of our report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4403)|
| 1:13:29| And what folks find hard to believe, and the numbers kind of are stunning when you look at them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4409)|
| 1:13:36| that just a five percent increase in local food purchasing would potentially generate $100 million to our local economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4416)|
| 1:13:44| When a consumer spends $100 at a local business, a local store, that local $100 translates into $45 more that's spent within our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4424)|
| 1:13:59| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| If they make the same purchase in a national chain, only $13 of that $100 stays within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4440)|
| 1:14:09| We are missing an economic opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| A Tennessee study, state of Tennessee study, indicated that 27 percent of all retail sales are from food items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4452)|
| 1:14:21| yet agricultural products only make up one percent of the gross domestic product of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4461)|
| 1:14:31| We in Knox County spend millions of dollars to have fuel transported from across the country and the world to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4471)|
| 1:14:39| If you look at the two examples that are on the screen, a potato and a carrot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| you've got roughly about 1,800 miles that each of those vegetables have to travel to get to our table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4484)|
| 1:14:51| Yet we have farmers within our community and within this area growing those same items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4491)|
| 1:14:57| And there are barriers that are still out there for us to be able to use locally grown, locally sourced produce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4497)|
| 1:15:03| Even in Knox County schools where we've purchased over $900,000 worth of produce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| only $300,000 more of that can be done through local sourcing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4508)|
| 1:15:17| It was real exciting to see the grant that was approved today or that will be approved for the farmer's market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4517)|
| 1:15:24| And you can see the impact that farmer's markets are making on our community and the success that we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4524)|
| 1:15:30| We are seeing much more through our food policy council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| We're noticing a higher incidence of restaurants, of markets springing up in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4534)|
| 1:15:41| where folks are really pursuing locally grown produce and products from within this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4541)|
| 1:15:49| So what can we do as Knox County residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| We can support policies that are directed toward businesses that purchase locally grown goods to sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| support policies that increase agricultural products production by farmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| It's been a real pleasure for me through the food policy council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| Only through the food policy council was I able, as a new director in the school district, to reach out to local farmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4567)|
| 1:16:15| It was through the efforts of the food policy council that I was able to start working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| through the farm to school project that we've been on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| And through that effort and through the policies that we have, we can really reach out to our farmers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| and even get more agricultural production in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| Support policies that provide incentives for farmers growing fresh fruits and vegetables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| and support policies to increase urban and community gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4595)|
| 1:16:41| We're very excited about an event we have coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| It's the Eat, Play, Live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| We're getting to celebrate the 30-year anniversary of the food policy council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| And also, we have all kinds of events planned, and we look forward to what this event holds for our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4611)|
| 1:17:06| Do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4626)|
| 1:17:07| I have one, if I could ask it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| Encouragingly, and maybe correct me if I'm wrong, Stephanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4630)|
| 1:17:15| If we're trying to encourage local people to grow more fruit product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| isn't the federal government paying people not to grow product?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| I mean, aren't we contradicting each other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| Certainly, there are policies at all levels that either support or inhibit produce production| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4646)|
| 1:17:33| and consumption of healthy foods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| So we understand that, and we hope that our members will reach out to those national organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| and federal agencies that make those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| I think John has run up against some of those himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| What we're trying to focus on is what can we actually do locally to make a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| because we think that we do have some good opportunities through local policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| and just through local awareness to help people understand that we can support our local food system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4674)|
| 1:18:01| Thank you for what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| And we have a honey producer right here, and that's Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| You're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| I may be the only one in the commission that's been to the farmer's market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| sitting in a booth selling things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| So that's the disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| So I don't know if that keeps me from voting on this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| But anyway, what I was going to ask, you know, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| you talked about how it costs 20 percent more for the people that live in the poorest areas of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| versus the more well-to-do areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| In general, how do the ---- and also you showed how if we spend money on local small businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4711)|
| 1:18:38| it keeps 45 cents here versus 13 for the large food chains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| And I'm asking this not as a point of question, but how do the food prices at the farmer's market compare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4723)|
| 1:18:51| If you buy a bushel of green beans at the farmer's market versus a bushel of green beans at Kroger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4731)|
| 1:18:57| how does that compare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| Because I know sometimes ---- because I also have an orchard that I ---- and blueberries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| and things like that that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| And I know sometimes it's very difficult for us by the time we pay for ---- it's hard to grow apples without sprays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4745)|
| 1:19:13| But, you know, by the time you pay your sprays, all these other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| it's really difficult to compete with your grapes and some of these other things that are coming from Chile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| and South America and Mexico, where labor prices are cheaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| and we don't even know what they're putting on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| But how do farmer's market prices compare to Kroger's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4767)|
| 1:19:34| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4774)|
| 1:19:35| Thank you, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| The ---- I guess the easy answer to your question is that there are costs associated with food that you ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4777)|
| 1:19:46| if you're buying sort of a large scale production type of food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| the cost that you pay at the store is probably going to be less than the cost that you would pay at your local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4791)|
| 1:19:57| farmer's market because economy of scale kicks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| And so what you find is that those labor costs, those production costs on a large scale basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4801)|
| 1:20:08| are really suppressing the cost, the real cost of food to the environment and the economy and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4808)|
| 1:20:15| So the real dollars we pay may be higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| It depends on the food item at the local farmer's market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| Now there is some research showing that as the cost of fuel goes up and as labor costs go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4821)|
| 1:20:29| and as the cost of environmental impact like natural disasters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| if we're getting most of our food from very far away and it's in a place that's susceptible to natural disasters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4833)|
| 1:20:39| then the cost of that sort of industrial food is going to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4839)|
| 1:20:44| And as the demand for local food, which means that the market for local food expands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| the cost of that local food will go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| And we're beginning to see that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4851)|
| 1:20:52| So I hope that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| My question will be similar to Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| I noticed 1.2 million spent on produce, right, but only 300,000 local produce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4861)|
| 1:21:08| I'm surprised it's that low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| That's with the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| Is that to do with red tape with subsidies free and reduced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| Or what's the why so little?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4878)|
| 1:21:22| Are you prohibited from buying that locally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| As part of my child nutrition program, we receive USDA commodities to support that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4885)|
| 1:21:33| Over time and as fresh fruits and vegetables has become more of a focus for schools nationwide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4893)|
| 1:21:39| the barriers to purchasing fresh fruits and vegetables have begun to lessen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4899)|
| 1:21:46| So the barriers are becoming easier to overcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| As part of our budget dollars, we send some of that money to what's called the Department of Defense Produce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4909)|
| 1:21:56| and it's who manages the fresh fruit and vegetable programs for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4916)|
| 1:22:03| We sent $900,000 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| Outside of that, we've purchased local produce around $300,000 is what our intention is to purchase outside of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4927)|
| 1:22:14| produce agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| One of the nice things that has begun to happen this year is we are actually seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| through that Department of Defense produce program, additional local Tennessee agriculture being featured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4942)|
| 1:22:30| So out of Athens, Tennessee, we purchased cucumbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| We purchased some tomatoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4955)|
| 1:22:39| Above and beyond the local items that we've purchased, like the strawberries, the sweet potatoes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| the blackberries and raspberries that we've purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| So I do see the barriers coming down, but there's still some to overcome in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4966)|
| 1:22:53| Then something that's obviously, for the most part, not grown in this area, like year-round lettuce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| I know you grow lettuce in the summer, but I'm thinking what I see in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| I see some lettuce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| I see some fruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| Not an abundance of fruits and vegetables at the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| I know those kids, probably most of the vegetables are canned, I would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4986)|
| 1:23:12| Not in the last 15 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| Now, I'm still trying to find some tacos and pizza that makes the mayor happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| but we definitely have plenty of fruits and vegetables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| But if it can be grown locally, you're okay in purchasing it locally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5004)|
| 1:23:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| And we're even encouraging school gardens and trying to purchase through school gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| We're really trying to find opportunities to purchase local as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| Of course, the main issue is that we're out of school when a substantial amount of these products are being grown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5015)|
| 1:23:41| But we really have expanded our fresh fruit and vegetable purchases as far as fresh produce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5021)|
| 1:23:47| We're probably purchasing two to three times the produce we were purchasing 15 months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| Mr. Burles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| So aside from policy decisions that we could make that would support these initiatives that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5034)|
| 1:24:02| what's the thing that we can most do that would have the biggest positive impact on our local economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5042)|
| 1:24:10| when it comes to our food system and food sources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5050)|
| 1:24:18| So I think on an individual level, purchasing locally grown foods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| And it sounds like you have a source for some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| You've got some honey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| I think my daughter talked him out of a couple of pounds last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| So there are several outlets for local food, and I won't promote them here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| but I will just tell you that there are several outlets that focus on local and regional food in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| What the retail operators and the farmers will tell you is that there's a huge piece of our food system that's missing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5082)|
| 1:24:50| and that's a food processor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| We do not have a single food processor within our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| And so when you think about a food processor, that's a place that will take food that's grown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| and that could be grown out of the earth or it could be an animal product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| and converts it into something that can be used by either a restaurant or the school system or a retail outfit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5106)|
| 1:25:14| So even something as simple as taking lettuce and washing it and bagging it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| we don't have a place that does that in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| And that's a huge missing gap for our economy, I believe, and for the local food system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5123)|
| 1:25:29| It's something that farmers miss out on as well as retailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| Entrepreneurs may be listening right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5135)|
| 1:25:36| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| Here, just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5137)|
| 1:25:38| Well, how does Granger County do it with their tomatoes that I see in the Kroger store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| Do they send it to Atlanta and send it back up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| Is that what happens, or do they have kind of a special?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| Through the process of us trying to source local farmers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| we were able to go visit RNC, which is in Granger County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5153)|
| 1:25:57| And they have a facility there where they can sort tomatoes, pack tomatoes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5157)|
| 1:26:03| but there's not a facility there that can further process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| You know, I made reference to the blackberries and raspberries that we were able to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| The only way we were able to do that was the farmer that we purchased them from has his own freezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| And so he was able to freeze those items, you know, straight from the field into a bucket and freeze them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5176)|
| 1:26:22| And so at that point then we further processed it in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5182)|
| 1:26:26| I'm sure all the commissioners would like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| Could you all send the presentation to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5192)|
| 1:26:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| Commissioner Burroughs, thank you for bringing this to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| We have two more discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| Commissioner Smith, yours was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| Do you want to go first before the Tourism and Sports Corp.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| or do you want to go afterwards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| You want to go now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5206)|
| 1:26:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5208)|
| 1:26:49| You were on the agenda first, so go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5209)|
| 1:26:50| This is a discussion on the Knox County certification process and bonus policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| I really want to try to keep this a little bit brief today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| This is just really has metaphors into something that just we're finding stuff out all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5219)|
| 1:27:05| A lot of you have got this in there, I think, in your --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| Did you all receive a copy of these, the CTAS, the information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| Is Gary Hayes here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| Gary, I've talked to you on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| You came up from Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| If you won't make your way to the microphone, I've got a few things I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5238)|
| 1:27:22| You brought some of his people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| Commissioners, what I'm looking at here, the reason I'm discussing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5244)|
| 1:27:29| and I guess one of my main concerns is that I'm just disturbed about the bonus system of the second year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5249)|
| 1:27:38| and thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| Second year and thereafter, you seem to just take a two-day course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5259)|
| 1:27:43| no matter if you take four hours here or five hours there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| and add it all together to take two days, 16 hours, and you end up getting $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5265)|
| 1:27:51| So it's a lot of people to keep your certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| A lot of people are certified in the state of Tennessee that have a license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| state license, that take continuing ed classes, and they get nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| They take it on their own time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| But as I understand it, and, Gary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| that's what you guys are going to answer a lot of these questions and stuff for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5285)|
| 1:28:09| And I believe in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| The program is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| It's a good program that we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| I'm just concerned a little bit about the compensation of it and the level of compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| And then the more we go into it, I'm finding, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| that other counties are way different from what we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| I mean, some counties, almost the size of Knox County, pay, you know, $200| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| or will pay $3,000 for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| So I just wanted to get some information, some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| I'm here to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5316)|
| 1:28:37| I don't know all the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| And, you know, if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| I'll be the first to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| It's really been a topic that a lot of people are concerned with in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5322)|
| 1:28:49| What we want to do, and I'll announce this at the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| we have a committee that we have formed, and we're going to talk more on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| And so if the CTAS people can come and talk to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| And others may want to address it today, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| And the reason I'm bringing it before here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| Mr. Troy was telling me that half the money comes from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| So I think that's why we need to listen to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| It's not just a state issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| It does affect us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5351)|
| 1:29:12| So I've got several people that are going to come speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| So gentlemen, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5355)|
| 1:29:16| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| Are you from Chattanooga, too, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| No, I'm from Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5359)|
| 1:29:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5360)|
| 1:29:21| Mr. Chairman, do you want to or just if you'll state your name and record for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5365)|
| 1:29:26| My name is Mike Garland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5366)|
| 1:29:27| I'm the Executive Director of the County Technical Assistance Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| My address is 226 Capitol Boulevard, Building, Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5371)|
| 1:29:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing us to be on your program today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| We are glad to take this opportunity to come to your commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| and hopefully maybe clear up some of the information that has been out there for the last few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5384)|
| 1:29:50| I know I've spoke with numerous news reporters over the last few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| And so I think this would be a good opportunity for us to take a look at the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5395)|
| 1:30:01| and maybe clear up any misinformation that there might be out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| First, let me just say that this program has been in existence for almost a quarter of a century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| It was set up by state statute, and we have administered that program during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5410)|
| 1:30:15| It's a nationally recognized program that has trained thousands of county officials across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5415)|
| 1:30:21| As a matter of fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| I think I heard one of your commissioners in nominating someone to your Charter Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| cite that this person was a certified public administrator as one of the qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| So we have hundreds of certified public administrators across the state at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| and we've trained a lot of county officials during the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| I have with me today Gary Hayes and Bob Shetler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| Together they have over 50 years' experience in county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| and they have been working with this program during all that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5448)|
| 1:30:52| And I'm going to turn it over to them to give you some of the more details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| I think what Commissioner Smith said was an excellent idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| and it's a study committee that we will be more than happy to work with to make sure that this program is operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5459)|
| 1:31:06| in a manner that is conducive to the needs of Knox County is our goal, and I'm sure it is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5466)|
| 1:31:13| So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Gary and Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| Mr. Chairman, if I could, gentlemen, as you approach, would you ensure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| and you may have already had this prepared over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| would you distinguish for the commission the distinction between elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| or as the code reads county officers and county employees as to the certified public administration program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5488)|
| 1:31:35| during the course of your presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| We'd appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5497)|
| 1:31:38| So they can understand the distinction of whose benefits what, funding sources, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| I'm Bob Shetler, and I'm with CTAS also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| This is a sidebar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5508)|
| 1:31:49| I'm a Knox civilian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5509)|
| 1:31:50| We could tell by your lapel pin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| But I've been with the training program since its inception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| I was the administrator of it, and we've had we're passing out some material here to show you the numbers of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5517)|
| 1:32:03| that have been through it as well as the people in Knox County that are participating in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5523)|
| 1:32:09| Now, this is an 80-hour training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| It takes 80 hours to complete it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| Forty of those hours are Category A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| We call them Category A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:21| They are job-specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| They're technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5544)|
| 1:32:25| All of those hours are tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5545)|
| 1:32:30| Then 20 hours is considered professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| Those are courses like leadership, communication, dealing with the public, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| Those are not tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| So you get to 60 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| Then the 20 hours, the additional 20 hours, is a three-day program, not a two-day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5562)|
| 1:32:49| three-day program that focuses on team-building and problem-solving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5569)|
| 1:32:54| In addition, to get to the capstone is the three-day program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5574)|
| 1:32:59| You have to take a 50-question closed-book test on the county government handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5579)|
| 1:33:06| If you fail that test, you don't go to capstone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| Then once you are certified, the 16 hours is recertification each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5589)|
| 1:33:16| Each fiscal year, if you're certified, you must take 16 more hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5596)|
| 1:33:21| The two-day thing that Commissioner Smith referred to is one option to get to 16 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5601)|
| 1:33:28| Many employees, many county elected officials are one-people office in the smaller counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5608)|
| 1:33:36| They can't get their 16 hours by going to multiple meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| So we offer them a chance to get their 16 hours in a two-day setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5621)|
| 1:33:47| And about 100 of them do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| But we have over 800 who are trying to get certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| Do you mind to pull the mic a little closer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| I think it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5636)|
| 1:33:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5637)|
| 1:33:58| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5638)|
| 1:33:59| As far as the elected and the appointed and the deputy certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5639)|
| 1:34:04| the statute that the state of Tennessee General Assembly passed identifies elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5644)|
| 1:34:15| full-time elected officials, plus clerk and masters, as receiving a salary incentive or supplement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5655)|
| 1:34:26| once they have completed our training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| Now, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| When you say clerk and master, is that elected clerks or a clerk that's working at the front desk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5670)|
| 1:34:36| I'm talking about circuit clerk, criminal court clerk, probate clerk, the elected clerks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5676)|
| 1:34:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5682)|
| 1:34:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5683)|
| 1:34:44| But, Commissioner Smith, in some counties, the clerk and master is elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| For instance, in Blount County, where ours is appointed, but they fall under the definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| under Tennessee Code 51310 as a county officer as compared to a county employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:56| The only people, if you want to get it down to the bottom line, the only people that are elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| that are not eligible for the salary incentive are the county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5701)|
| 1:35:07| You're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| Because you're not full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| You're part-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| All full-time, sheriff, everybody else, they are eligible, assuming they get certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5711)|
| 1:35:18| and assuming they recertify, they are eligible for the salary incentive that the state gives them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5718)|
| 1:35:25| That incentive is beyond our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| That's up to the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| Sometimes it's $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| Sometimes it's $1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| Sometimes it's $1,300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| No county employee is eligible for that salary incentive unless, and this was the addendum to that law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5734)|
| 1:35:43| they passed an addendum to that that said the county commission can add the incentive to the incentive up to $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5743)|
| 1:35:54| So for, let's say, a county elected official got $1,500, then you could put in $1,500 for the county elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5754)|
| 1:36:04| You could also award it to the county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| That's your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| That's a local decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| All we do at CTAS is we train them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part1?start=5772)|
