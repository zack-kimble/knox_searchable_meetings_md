| 0:15:09| Weigels has a history of really taking these matters seriously and following up with employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| and using it as a learning experience, and so I just wanted to take the opportunity to thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=914)|

| 0:15:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| Seeing no other questions, I'll turn this over to Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| And I do know that you all take this seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| I mean, you have been, what, 14 years without a violation at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| and I would imagine you're having many of the problems that other businesses in the area are with your personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=946)|
| 0:15:54| so I regret that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| Plus, I know you all are always packed at this location, always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| So at any rate, I have the choice by law of offering you a 30-day suspension of your license or a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=961)|
| 0:16:12| We'll pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| I make a motion, then, to accept the fine on Item 7A from Weigels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=974)|

| 0:16:31| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| The next one is Weigels No. 74 at 1405 Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| That's District 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| All right, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| Would you give us your name and address for the record once again, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| Elizabeth Hoffer, 7712 LeBarrington Boulevard, Powell, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Let's get the Sheriff's report on this, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| On March 25, 2020, four officers with the Knox County Sheriff's Office conducted an alcohol compliance check at Weigels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| located at 1405 Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| The defendant sold a White Call alcoholic beverage to the underage person after checking their ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| All right, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| You plead guilty or not guilty to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| Guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| The explanation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| Ms. Kim, the former employee, read the ID wrong and put in the wrong date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| Had she entered the correct date into our POS system, it would have prevented that, but she put the wrong date in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| We have since terminated her employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| We did have a meeting there at that location also to go over it with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| This one we didn't find out about until a couple of days after it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| So because of the severity of two in one day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| we actually put in a little thing to where every single one of our employees who clock in now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| have to acknowledge what the rules and regulations are for selling alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| with a yes or a no that goes into their employee file immediately when they clock in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| Do we have any questions from any commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| I'm sorry, Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| It still amazes me that when you say that the clerk looked at the ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| and then punched the numbers in and got it incorrect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| except that they should have never even taken the ID out of the person's hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1093)|
| 0:18:20| because, as you know, the format for the state of Tennessee is if they're under 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| the driver's license looks like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| So if anybody hands them, I mean, they've made it idiot proof for retailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| Believe me, we completely understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| And we had that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| That was something that Rachel and I were just talking about earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| She was like, I just don't even understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| She should have scrutinized the ID even more, right, because it was a vertical ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1121)|
| 0:18:49| I'm sorry that happened to you guys because, like Commissioner Fraser said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| you guys have such a great reputation in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| and it's sad to see these things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| But I don't know how the state can do anything different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| than change the shape of the identification card to make it so easy for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| You know, we had the conversation with our employees, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| how she chose to use our scanners because, you know, we have scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| And if she had chose to look at the ID, verify that the person was the right person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| look at the date, and then scan it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| then she wouldn't have even had the opportunity to put in the wrong date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| It would have done it for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| I will take this one since this is in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| The scanners, when you run the driver's license through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| don't you have a scanner that does that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| Yeah, that's what I was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| We do have a scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| So if she had chose to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| and she took the ID instead of manually typing in the date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| if she had chose to scan it, she wouldn't have made that mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| I want to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1192)|

| 0:20:13| Do we have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1216)|

| 0:21:45| I'm assisting her through the first five or six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| but she'll eventually take over for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| Oh, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| Well, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| Thank you, Mr. McBride, for checking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| He did state that nobody is out there, so we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| This is a second offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| but I can make a motion to move this on until next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| if I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| I'll second that, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| Motion made by Commissioner Oster, seconded by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| I'm having a hard time with names today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| If there's no more business to come, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| Just clarifications on that first one, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| We need to make sure we add the certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| It was just a motion to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| but it didn't mention anything about that fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| It was the fire, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| Do we have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| I asked everybody, and nobody said a CO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| When the motion was made, the motion was to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| As presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| As presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| But usually we make a motion to approve pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| Well, I don't think anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| Fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| Fire did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Mr. Elliott and I have had a conversation recently about a lot of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| places that already have a certificate of occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| don't really need to get another one when they're just changing ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| And so where you might normally be accustomed to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| it's not necessarily going to be the case in every case going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| We have in Farris County when we adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| we adopted what's called a tenant permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| So when there is a new tenant, a name change is the way we interpret that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| They need a new CO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| But in this case, the pizza house, it's still the pizza house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| And the building code doesn't recognize the ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| So they would just keep the same CO for the pizza house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| Now, one of them did change names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| That's why they would need a new CO because the CO would need to have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| name of the business on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| The reason I asked that question, because that young lady there maybe had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| I've made motions before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| And then on the next day I get a phone call from the county clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| saying, does this tip, you want this stipulation in there too, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| Just clarifying is all I was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| Wasn't it a fire inspection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| It was fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| And fire does annual inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| They will go out and do annual inspection to ensure that they meet all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| life safety code requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| That is a requirement of the bureau ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1457)|
| 0:24:24| Commissioner Jay, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| I had a question about the last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| It got voted on already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| What happens if the applicant doesn't show up again next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| You know, I would treat it like I would as a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| I'd find them in default and I'd penalize them whatever you feel is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| I would suggest that if they don't show up a third time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| you just pull their license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| I mean, you revoke their license for a period of time without the fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| and just let them show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| The penalties that we present are suggestive only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| And it's good that we use them because it keeps us from being accused of too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| much disparate treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| So when you go outside of them, you need to have a good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| Somebody not showing up is a pretty good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| Seeing none, this beer board is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240415-beer-board?start=1516)|
