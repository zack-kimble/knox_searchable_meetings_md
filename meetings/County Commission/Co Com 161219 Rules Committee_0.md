| 0:00:07| What is your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=7)|
| 0:00:10| We want to call to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=10)|

| 0:00:21| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=21)|
| 0:00:22| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=22)|
| 0:00:23| Three members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=23)|
| 0:00:24| Do we have a quorum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=24)|
| 0:00:25| We have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=25)|
| 0:00:26| There's only three of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=26)|
| 0:00:27| We can make any rules we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=27)|
| 0:00:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=29)|
| 0:00:32| That sounds good to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=32)|
| 0:00:34| Why I call this meeting to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=34)|
| 0:00:39| Put your mic down, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=39)|
| 0:00:42| One idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=42)|
| 0:00:43| I was looking back and I felt uncomfortable this last time when I asked you all to approve minutes that you weren't even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=43)|
| 0:00:52| Did you do that, Brad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=52)|
| 0:00:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=56)|
| 0:00:59| Well, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=59)|
| 0:01:01| I'm going to ask you all to approve the minutes of the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=61)|
| 0:01:06| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=68)|
| 0:01:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=69)|
| 0:01:11| All opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=71)|
| 0:01:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=73)|
| 0:01:15| The discussion, item number three, was the last time we had the call roll meeting and we discussed some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=75)|
| 0:01:23| I asked for you all to approve the minutes of the last meeting and a couple of the members were not even on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=83)|
| 0:01:36| And I felt uncomfortable in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| But it was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=100)|
| 0:01:42| So what I want to discuss right now is how we can change this to get the minutes approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=102)|
| 0:01:50| So if we didn't have another meeting until, say, another committee was put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=110)|
| 0:01:59| that all they would be doing is approving the approval that we approve the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=119)|
| 0:02:07| Like I said, I just felt uncomfortable with asking you all to approve minutes that you had no part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=127)|
| 0:02:17| You can't, the minutes are not complete until, I mean, they're not going to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| If you can't vote, you'd have to have a meeting just to approve the minutes, which create minutes for another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| Well, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| But the minutes were just minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| I mean, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| So you can't pre-approve minutes that are not typed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=150)|
| 0:02:34| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| But we are approving the minutes we did have typed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Yeah, but I mean, you're talking about eliminating that for next year and you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=159)|
| 0:02:44| Because you're always going to have a previous meeting, even if you just vote to approve the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| Can you send it by e-mail later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| And it has to be all in person, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=172)|
| 0:02:57| Does, for the law director, does it matter if people are approving things from a committee they didn't sit on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=177)|
| 0:03:06| Yeah, because you can't approve, technically you can't approve minutes if you weren't there to know whether they were proper or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| That's one of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| So what you'd have to do is have an August meeting of all committees to approve the minutes of any meeting that's outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=194)|
| 0:03:22| And then you'd have to have a meeting to approve the minutes of that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| Which creates more minutes for another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| Why don't we just go to seconds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| The reason why I mentioned it, I felt uncomfortable with the two new members asking them to do an action that they had no part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=215)|
| 0:03:44| And by doing this, just having you approve these minutes, then you don't have any actions to be done other than approving the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=224)|
| 0:03:55| Could we approve minutes for our committees at our regular meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=235)|
| 0:04:04| And then Joe Lee pointed out that you would still run into that problem with if you had a committee that met right before the end of a term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=244)|
| 0:04:13| and somebody else was coming on, but just at that last regular session, regular work, not work session, but regular meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=253)|
| 0:04:22| make sure we get all the unapproved minutes on that agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=262)|
| 0:04:32| We could do that, but we do have committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| What I'm addressing here is committees that don't meet on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=275)|
| 0:04:43| But, I mean, you even have that problem with, say, the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| They meet right before our regular meetings, but we don't have to approve those here, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=286)|
| 0:04:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| Or the audit committee sometimes meets right before our regular meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| and that could hit the last month of a cycle when new people are coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=299)|
| 0:05:06| I think Brad brings up the circular never-ending Mobius bell or whatever on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=306)|
| 0:05:14| I reviewed Robert's Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| Of course, we've got our own, and where we don't have any, Robert's Rules fits in, and they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=316)|
| 0:05:24| you can pretty much set what you want for your committees, whether they do it by report or minutes or what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| But the problem we face is any open meeting has to have minutes, and if it's got to have minutes, they've got to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=330)|
| 0:05:39| I don't know quite how to get out of what Brad brings up is that circular nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| You have a special call meeting to approve the fact that you approved the minutes from the prior meeting, and it goes on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=344)|
| 0:05:51| See, with this meeting right here, all I was wanting to do is to approve the meetings that we had last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| Now that we have a discussion, now we've got minutes now to come on down the road to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| What if you don't take any action in this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| There are no minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| We don't take a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| Well, we just voted on the minutes, so never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| Well, how about just the members that were on it last year just approving the minutes and not asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=371)|
| 0:06:19| You've got to have a quorum do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| It's got to be in a positive vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| Well, how many years have we done it like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| 225.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| So it just bothered me to that point, and that's all I'm bringing it up for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| It just bothered me to ask somebody to do something that they had no part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| Well, thanks, Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| You caused us to have to come at 3.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| I think there's two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| One is, in August, when you've got a new commission coming in and new members, they can't vote on what didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=405)|
| 0:06:52| During the year, if the Rules Committee or any other committee were to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| then you could easily call a special call meeting before the next commission meeting and approve those minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=417)|
| 0:07:05| But like Brad says, that's a meeting in and of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=425)|
| 0:07:11| I don't know how to get out of the circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| But the only thing you're doing in that final meeting is approving the minutes of all the other meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| So there's no action, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| So really what you want to do in August is clear everybody's minutes and start all over the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| Because really, there's really, at the heart of that, there's really no action that is, you can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| well, I wasn't there to do that because you're just approving the minutes from the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=454)|
| 0:07:42| You're condoning the vote, which you can watch online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=462)|
| 0:07:49| So to clean it up, to really have an August meeting of all the committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| to clean up their minutes, if it makes the law department more comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| Maybe we should just make a rule that all committees have a meeting at the end of August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=478)|
| 0:08:05| to report all their minutes and vote on before we begin the new year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| To get that, but what if you have one of your committee people absent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| What if they have, like, two or three meetings that year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| And then you have one committee person that's absent from that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| then they would have to abstain from that meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| Vote on it anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Well, it's still third committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| Good math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| Does that work, Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| I don't even know if you have to have a rule to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| Do you have to have a rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| Do you have it in writing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| I don't think so because we don't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| The only thing that requires minutes is the Open Meetings Act, and it's not in your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| I think if you do that, if you want to reduce it to writing, you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| but I don't think you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| You just call a special meeting to do all that in August at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| Or just do it in the, can you do it in the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| Well, yeah, I mean, it would take a lot, I mean, it's going to take a lot of busy work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| I mean, it's just like reforming the commission every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| I mean, essentially you're deconstructing the commission, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=551)|
| 0:09:18| I think that's a good idea, what Brad suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| So do I hear a motion that we request that last meeting in August to clear the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=562)|
| 0:09:31| Ask the law department to review what minutes need to be cleared every year with the chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| and get that set up in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| So do we need a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| No, it's not really, you're not putting it in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| Item four, do we have any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| Have we got bylaws for the zonings and where can I get a copy of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| I guess one of my questions is, is when zonings come up, say like if something comes up in the ninth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=601)|
| 0:10:09| I should know more about that zoning and I want to be the one that makes the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| or defer the motion to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| Is that in our rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| I think it's been kind of like a courtesy agreement or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| Does it need to be in the rules or are we all ladies and gentlemen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| I don't think it needs to be in the rules because you've got two large commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| that would never get to be in favor of a motion or make a motion and resolve in zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=631)|
| 0:10:38| They get to make them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| But I think that's kind of a courtesy deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| But the person that, I mean, the other, then you're going into somebody making negative motions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=643)|
| 0:10:50| and you're trying to figure all that out too because if you've got somebody that's in their district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| and if I'm against it, but everybody, if there's eight, six people that get for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| they're going to vote to the negative and then you've got that question again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| Do we have a problem that we need to be fixing or is it just, I mean, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| I'm new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| That's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| I've always had a courtesy on BZA that your district was the one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| except for sometimes if the chair had one in his district or zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=672)|
| 0:11:20| he might defer to let someone else make it because he may be the deciding vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| The chair should never vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| I don't think the chair should never vote until the very last thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| because it could be the tying vote or the winning or losing vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| So that's how we did it at BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| That's just my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| Is it in the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| Is it in the bylaws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Or where can we get a copy of the bylaws and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| In the commission rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| I don't think I've ever seen it written to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| I always thought that it was just a courtesy of that person in that district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| who had the first either to want to make the motion or defer to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| And if you put it in the rules that the person from the commission has to make the nomination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| they could absolutely kill it by not making the vote or not making the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| Or if they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| Yeah, or if they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| So you could kill something that never comes to a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| which takes it out of representation of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=741)|
| 0:12:31| Do we have any action on that part or just leave it as a courtesy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=751)|
| 0:12:45| Well, there is in our rules, commission rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| that talks about zoning ordinance and rezoning requests and appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=768)|
| 0:13:07| The way I've always heard it, it's just been pretty much common courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=787)|
| 0:13:14| I mean, it's just always kind of been a thing unsaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| Courtesy to the commissioner of that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| So right now, do we just want to leave it as is, as an understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=802)|
| 0:13:32| Everybody in favor of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=812)|
| 0:13:39| Well, I hear no motion, so we'll just leave it as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| If we have nothing else, I'm going to call it adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| Do we have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161219RulesCommittee?start=827)|
