| 0:03:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| I would like to request, council, a lot of people have come and done a lot of work to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| speak to 11R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| It's not routine, but I would like to hear some of the people, when the item comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=223)|
| 0:03:49| the people that signed up to speak on it, be allowed to speak on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| Just a reminder to council that you're currently discussing just the merits of whether to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| this two weeks or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| That would be an amendment to the postponement, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| Or you can vote no to the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| Ms. Parker and then Ms. Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| I'll wait until after and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| Just along the same lines, since we have so many members of the public here to speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| that agenda item, I think it would be better if we had time to allow for that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=263)|
| 0:04:30| and then the item could be postponed once the item is read later in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=270)|
| 0:04:38| Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| To that point, I know that we're voting on the postponement, but on the discussion, my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| concern is that there are members of the art community, specifically, that aren't here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=287)|
| 0:04:54| knowing this agenda item is going to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| Therefore, I feel like all the stakeholders should be here to be able to speak on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| topic at the time that the vote occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| Thank you, Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| Just as a point of information, as you all consider this, all the people who signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| to speak on item 11-R have also signed up to speak at public forum, so they would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| their opportunity to speak at that time if that informs your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| Any further questions or discussion on the motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Motion carries 7-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| Motion to postpone carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=335)|

| 0:05:43| Are there any items requested to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| There's nothing on the consent agenda, so we'll move right along to my report to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=348)|

| 0:19:17| facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| And in exchange for that, they've asked us to go ahead and initiate the last two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| of their contract, which would extend their contract through 2026.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1163)|
| 0:19:31| And then, can you tell me more about the food and beverage fee and benchmarks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| So, the way the contract works with Ovation's right now is a little convoluted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1176)|
| 0:19:42| So, they keep all the revenue, and Ovation pays us a commission per item they sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1182)|
| 0:19:49| So, different items have different commission rates that they pay us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| If it's beer, they pay us one rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| If it's Coca-Cola, they pay us another rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| It doesn't matter what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| They just pay us a rate per item they sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| We don't know what their total sales are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| They just give us a check based on what they've sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| So, with SMG, they're not going to charge us a rate to manage the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1208)|
| 0:20:16| They are going to get an incentive fee based on the total amount of sales they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| So, it's the same way it works at the convention center right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| Up to a certain point, they provide all those services for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| After a certain point, there are benchmark incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| If they sell $500,000 worth of merchandise and concessions items, they start paying us a fee at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1231)|
| 0:20:41| Or they earn a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| They earn an incentive fee for meeting benchmarks or exceeding benchmarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| So, that's how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| Part of the reason I have questions is because I thought the arrangement was interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| especially considering the arrangement before us in terms of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1257)|
| 0:21:06| This seems like a much better model to put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| I'm having a hard time understanding how it's advantageous to the city to hire someone to manage concessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1269)|
| 0:21:20| and not share in the profits of those concessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| So, this seems like a much better arrangement to be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| I can't speak to other types of contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| I'm just familiar with these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| 11B is the resolution approving an amendment to a prior amendment to the Summit Hill redevelopment plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| extending the allocation period for tax increment financing from 20 years to 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1309)|
| 0:21:56| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| We have some speakers signed up on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| First person signed up to speak in opposition is Kent Minott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1326)|
| 0:22:17| You can start by stating your name and address for the record, and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| I'm Kent Minott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| I live at 311 West Glenwood Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| Good evening, Madam Mayor and council people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| There are friends here to speak on behalf of saving the trees in the Cradle of Country Music Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| Well, downtown tree canopy is precious, and we're also slated to lose some trees right across the street from the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1354)|
| 0:22:41| The Sierra Club and friends want to save all the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| Now, I'm not really opposed to the tax increment financing for the Summit Hill development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| Tim Hill can access the capital to build his condominiums, but if he's going to get that capital courtesy of the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1370)|
| 0:22:58| then he needs to send his architects back to the drawing board and save the five trees on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| or adjacent to public property, trees that he proposes to do away with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| We're in a unique moment tonight when the administration's misguided policy of being a lapdog for developers is coming home to roost in multiple ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1388)|
| 0:23:16| This philosophy makes the city's natural and built environment into a plaything for wealthy interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| to the detriment of the middle and low-income folks who form most of the city's population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| And the trend can be deadly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| What we're hearing about the heat island effect is telling us that when we let the trees be destroyed, the people will die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1409)|
| 0:23:37| In a recent report by Amanda Williams on NPR on a conference of health experts on rising heat levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| the conclusion was heat is the deadliest weather-related hazard in the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1423)|
| 0:23:50| Over the last 10 years, it's killed an average of 135 people per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| That's more than floods, hurricanes, or tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| Today, more than 13 million Americans are under an extreme heat warning, according to heat.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| And on August 3rd, it was 124 million, more than a third of the people in the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1445)|
| 0:24:12| Heat.gov is a new collaboration between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| and other federal agencies to improve our response to extreme heat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| That's the end of the quote from NPR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| Mature trees can release hundreds of gallons of water vapor every day through their leaves, cooling the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1464)|
| 0:24:31| Shaded areas can be 20 to 45 degrees cooler than peak temperatures in unshaded areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1471)|
| 0:24:38| Mature trees. That's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| If Knoxville's urban forester replaces mature trees with 2-inch saplings, we don't get the benefit for at least 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1481)|
| 0:24:49| Remember, there are elderly people living downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| I noticed in the agenda packet that the proposal is called an analysis of the applicant's proposal for public assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1493)|
| 0:25:00| Well, if Tim Hill is receiving public assistance, the public has a right to impose some conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| One of those conditions needs to be to save the five trees along Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| Back to the drawing board, Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| Then we'll be happy to support your application for public assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| Thanks so much for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| The next person signed up to speak is Axel Ringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| Mr. Ringer, you can come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| If you could state your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1527)|
| 0:25:35| Mayor Kincannon, men and women of the council, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| I'm Axel Ringer, and I represent 1,000-plus members of the Sierra Club who reside in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1541)|
| 0:25:51| And don't forget, please, your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| My address for the record is 1840 Lafayette Drive, Newmarket, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| I don't live in Knoxville, but I represent the Sierra Club in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1561)|
| 0:26:09| I support what Kent Minow just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| I think turning an asphalt parking lot into residential buildings is a good thing for the city, and we of the Sierra Club will support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1574)|
| 0:26:26| However, we also think that in exchange for the city providing Mr. Hill a TIF lasting 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1586)|
| 0:26:37| that's not unreasonable for the city to ask for something in return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| And I think that something in return could be saving the five trees that line Gay Street in front of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1603)|
| 0:26:53| That's all I have to say for that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| Thank you. Council, that concludes the people who signed up to speak to this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1620)|
| 0:27:08| I have a few questions about this project for whomever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1628)|
| 0:27:17| It could be Mr. Ben Bentley. It could be the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| But this agenda item has come before us before in April of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1642)|
| 0:27:32| At the time, it was a 20-year agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| And now it's come back to us as a 30-year agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| In reading through the amendment that's included in the packet, not much reason is given for the need for an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1662)|
| 0:27:58| It says based on current property tax rates and current projected assessment of the redevelopment project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1678)|
| 0:28:12| we now need a 30-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| The Municap report is also attached in here from April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| Let me start with that. Is the Municap report the same report that came before us when we reviewed this before in April?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1702)|
| 0:28:29| Or has there been a new analysis based on this new 30-year time period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| I know the answer to this, but I'm going to let Ben Bentley field it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| Go ahead and just remind Council of your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| Ben Bentley, 901 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| And if I get this wrong, please step in, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| This is a really simple math problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| We were assuming an appraised value of a certain amount when the tax rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| even though there's a net increase in property taxes citywide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| the actual rate applied on both the city and the county side were lowered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| When you apply those tax rates for the city and county to the appraised value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| it was a reduction in the amount of taxes every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| So the $3.7 million that's going toward this deal is the same number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| but it takes 30 years instead of 20 years to pay off that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1760)|
| 0:29:36| Thank you for that explanation. I thought that captured it well. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| So that's the only thing that's changed since it came before you in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| Well, to address the concerns of the residents who have recently spoken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1785)|
| 0:29:53| can we review what are the benefits from this project that KCDC has identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1793)|
| 0:30:02| in order to warrant this financial assistance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| I'm going to have Ms. Welch address this. It's about affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| So Ms. Welch, could you address that and also speak to the landscaping plans as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| Yeah, and I haven't finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| The other part of that would be why the trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| especially on public property around this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| were allowed to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1825)|
| 0:30:33| So I think the first part of the question was what was the public benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| of the redevelopment of this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| As was noted in one of the comments, this is a surface parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| It has been for probably most of the last half century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| It is not producing a whole lot of value for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| and it's been a prime redevelopment target area for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| This was a project that was bid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| We received multiple proposals for the redevelopment of this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| This particular proposal hit on some pretty key factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| including the integration of public spaces within the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| which will also include the planting of 14 trees and other landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| that will enhance the overall site well beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| We understand that there are five trees that are actually on the site of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| that in order to even meet downtown design standards and our city code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1894)|
| 0:31:42| and the setbacks and things like that to redevelop this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| those trees will be removed with 14 replacement trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| There are also workforce housing affordable units that will be incorporated into the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| which is an important priority for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| The project provides much-needed housing in an area that already has infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| So those are some of the key benefits that we see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| and just activating that corner and connecting downtown along Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| is also another important attribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| I think the other question was about the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| We did consult with our internal team and our city forester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1940)|
| 0:32:29| Certainly Mr. Hill has hired landscape architects to ensure that the long-range outcome on this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1949)|
| 0:32:38| will be an improvement not only to the cultural vibrancy of the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| but also through the addition of additional green infrastructure that's important for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1964)|
| 0:32:52| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| When this appeared before city council back in April, I had voted in favor of this agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1975)|
| 0:33:04| even though I expressed my displeasure that the project coming before us had four units, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1984)|
| 0:33:17| That will go towards the workforce development housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| Are you considering other units within that property to be workforce housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2002)|
| 0:33:29| Just the four units, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| The four units are workforce housing at about 75% of AMI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| That was disappointing for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| But what came before us before city council was not something necessarily that would allow us to make that change in that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2022)|
| 0:33:56| I also do not like the name of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| And there's this continuing theme that is going to have negative long-term consequences on the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2040)|
| 0:34:11| because of whose culture is being profited off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| And that's the honest truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| What's before us tonight allows KCDC more time to pay off the funding that has already been committed to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2060)|
| 0:34:32| I plan to vote for this item tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| But moving forward, we need stronger policies in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| I plan to be a part of that process to bring forward stronger policies that will protect our urban tree canopy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2082)|
| 0:34:51| that will protect our mature trees, especially in the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| Because most often when an item like this comes before city council, we're not provided with the designs and schematics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2096)|
| 0:35:06| And we don't know all the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| We just know that this is a redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| And there's a deal in place to provide financing for a project that will bring some public benefit to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2113)|
| 0:35:24| So I just thank you for that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| I wanted to go through those items so the public had a better understanding of what's before council tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2126)|
| 0:35:33| and explain my reason for voting in favor of this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| Thank you, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| Mr. Hill, you haven't signed up to speak and no one's asked you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| If they have a question for you, they can pose a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| Councilmember Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| Yes, I was just about to ask Mr. Hill a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| Mr. Hill, come on back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2152)|
| 0:36:01| Tim Hill, 311 Southwise, Garber Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| Thank you, Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| We had several discussions over several days, maybe weeks, over the trees in front of this proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2167)|
| 0:36:16| I'm sure you remember them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| Could you recount for the public and the council basically a summary of those discussions, if you recall them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2178)|
| 0:36:28| I can do my best because it has been some time since we discussed, but I do remember our time together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| And I will say that the redevelopment department had sent out an email, I think, to you and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2194)|
| 0:36:44| explaining, one, that really the zoning does not allow the trees to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2204)|
| 0:36:51| But in our downtown design standards, they have to be removed in order to develop this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| And that's exactly what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| We're complying with the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| So is it certain standards of setbacks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Yeah, that's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| And I just, I guess, wanted to recount that you and I had multiple discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| I expressed my interest in saving those trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| So I appreciate you kind of underlining that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| And I'll just end with a comment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| Overall, I support the development here as far as the density goes and the need for downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2247)|
| 0:37:34| That lot has needed to be redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| I kind of withdrew my objection to the development and the loss of the trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2258)|
| 0:37:48| because it appeared, according to the zoning regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| there wasn't that much of a choice to save the trees because of the present regulations for the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2272)|
| 0:38:02| And so there was little or nothing that could be done unless we made a change in the zoning laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2282)|
| 0:38:10| and the setback laws for downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| So I just wanted to get that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| I lament the fact that those trees are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| And if there was something to do, something I could have done to save them, I would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2298)|
| 0:38:24| You did give me some assurances that the remaining trees that didn't have to be removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2304)|
| 0:38:32| because of the zoning requirements would remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| and that there were some additional trees, as I recall, would be planted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| even though they would be younger, they would somewhat compensate for the loss of these very mature trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| Could you talk a little bit about what your project is going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| to try to at least compensate somewhat for the loss of these trees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| Certainly. I think we're talking about five trees here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| and we're planting approximately 14 along with other landscaping items as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| I do plan to support this, but I did want to give some background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| and reiterate my concern for those very mature trees that are going to be lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| Thank you for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| Thank you, Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| Councilmember Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| Thank you. I think I just have some comments to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| Councilman Thomas, you pointed out, these are our zoning ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| We made them. We can change them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| I think we need to make some adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2375)|
| 0:39:42| We are not beholden to them. It should be beholden to what we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| and if that's the reason that these trees are coming down, that's a real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| In replacing the trees, you cannot replace five adults with 14 children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| and say that, don't worry, they'll grow up one day and it'll be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| Thank you. Councilmember Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| Thank you, Mayor. We're all supportive of saving as many trees as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| This body passed the Tree Mitigation Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| I don't think it's in play for this scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| because the developer is planting the trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| but just for the public, as a reminder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| if our zoning ordinances don't allow for someone to plant trees downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| we have a Tree Mitigation Bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| which forces that developer to provide money for the trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| Thank goodness we're going to get 20 trees out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| All of this would save every tree if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| I just want to remind, or just one question for Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| The only reason this is in front of this body today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| if I can recap what you said in another way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| is that every five years, property taxes are reassessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| This property was reassessed in its value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| and therefore it's going to take a long time for it to be reassessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| This property was reassessed in its value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| and therefore it's going to take a longer time to reap the benefit of the pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| or the TIF in return. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| That's correct. Equalization actually causes our tax rate to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| Right. So the city would get less money as a result of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| if we don't pass it. Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| Correct. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| Thank you. There's nothing about the site plan or anything else that's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| Yes, I would like to respond to my colleague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| Councilwoman Singh, and her remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| And you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| Maybe we should revisit some of these zoning laws that we have in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| and see if there's a possible way that we can accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| both the needs on the housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| but also save those very important mature trees that there's few of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| So I don't dispute at all your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| In fact, I agree with it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| Thank you. Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| Thank you. Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| 11C is a resolution approving an amendment to the Magnolia Avenue Warehouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| District Redevelopment Plan relating to terms of tax increment financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| and delegating to the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| the authority to negotiate and accept payments in lieu| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| with respect to certain projects within the plan area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| Move to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| Council Members, just a few remarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| as you begin the discussion of these items C and D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| I just wanted to state that from the very beginning of the stadium proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| I said I would support it if the benefits to the people of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| outweighed the cost to the people of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| Since I've taken office, we have scrutinized this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| and thanks to Stephanie Welch, we've helped shape and negotiate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| And we've worked through more recently significant global market changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| that have affected not just this project but all construction projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| across our city and indeed across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| So since I've talked about the benefits and the cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| I just wanted to recount a few of the benefits that I see to this stadium project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| This stadium will revitalize a site that has been vacant for 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| and an area that has lacked investment for even longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| Knox County and the state of Tennessee are covering more than half the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| for this public amenity inside the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| I'm just going to repeat that because that's sort of historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| Knox County and the state of Tennessee are covering more than half the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| for this public amenity inside the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| And just last night, County Commission voted unanimously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| to apply their Knox County tax increment to help cover the cost of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| That's a big deal, and I want to publicly thank our Knox County commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| Randy Boyd, who's here tonight, has stepped up in a major way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| He donated the land, which is valued at $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| He's contributing in a just donation, free and clear, $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| Boyd Sports, thanks to our tough negotiations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| is going to pay $1 million a year for 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| and that's the highest rent ever negotiated for a minor league baseball team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| GEM Development has committed to an additional $100 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| in private projects surrounding the stadium site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| and that's going to be a major boon to East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| And now, the reason these items are here before you today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| Randy Boyd has agreed to cover the gap in funding through an unsecured loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| This unsecured loan will only be paid back after the city and county debts are paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| and only if the new tax revenues are actually generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| So what are the costs if we don't proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| We will perpetuate this notion that Knoxville is a city where the beginners win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| We will miss out on a once-in-a-generation opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| to create an amenity that will revitalize our community, particularly East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| an amenity that can attract and retain young people to our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| and an amenity that will provide jobs and investment for families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| So the bottom line, this is a good deal for the people of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| I support this project, and I hope council votes to approve these items tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| We have some people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| We have three people for and four people against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2713)|
| 0:45:18| and so we'll see if council wants to listen to more than the stated rules of six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| We'll start with the first three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| Brandon Bruce, please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| You have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| Don't start the clock yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2730)|
| 0:45:44| Hey, everybody. I'm Brandon Bruce, 9532 Clingmans Dome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| I always love being in this space because five years ago in front of school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| and Mayor Kincannon was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| we got the Guinness World Record for breaking the number of students learning how to code in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| which was pretty awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| And now we have the opportunity to talk about a huge project for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| Four weeks ago, I was riding my bicycle down Bluff Mountain pretty fast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| about 30 miles an hour, and came around a turn and ran smack into a black bear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| which is why today I join you with a broken foot and a broken leg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| But like thousands of other Knoxvillians that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| after getting out of the emergency room and the specialist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| I hustled straight over to West High School to catch the first playoff game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| for one Knoxville sporting club, our professional soccer team here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| which we won in our historic first season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| And I think the energy for so many of you that were there that night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| is emblematic of what's about to happen in Knoxville when we have this stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| Twenty years ago, my brother and I converted a Ford van| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| and drove about 30,000 miles across the United States, just crisscrossed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| Meet family that we hadn't met before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| Visit state capitals, state parks, most of the national parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| and catch as many summer baseball games as we possibly could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| everywhere from Kansas City to Baltimore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| And that was a huge attraction because it meant that we got to know those cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| and know the people and know the culture of all those cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| and we did it through baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| Ten years ago, I took my daughter to her first baseball game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| We went over to Kodak and watched the Smokies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| She was two. We sat on the grass in the outfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| I caught a home run ball and gave it to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| It's a ball she still has. We still talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| We have great memories of that game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| And around about the same time, ten years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| KCDC wrote a report on the Warehouse District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| referring to it as the heart of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| And I love that because I think the stadium is going to provide that rhythm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| rhythm of exciting activities, a pulse of the downtown area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| which I'm also excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| I think a couple years after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| Christy Branscombe at the time was deputy mayor and COO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| and for those of you in real estate, you're already familiar with this phrase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| but to me it was new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| She said, well, we're always looking for the highest and best use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| of a piece of land or a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| And to me, as Mayor Kincannon described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| this satisfies that criteria in spades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| I think it was three, four years ago, pre-pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| the mayor of Oklahoma City visited Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| for the Leadership Knoxville Mayor's Luncheon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| and stated simply, and he's written a full book about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| but simply stated, he said, to make a great city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| make a great city in which to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| And then he described ways in which they'd gone about that in Oklahoma City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| including the revitalization of their canal slash inner city river network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| and the construction of a big stadium that recruited their NBA basketball team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| And those were huge projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| big commitments on behalf of their citizenry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| that paid back in spades for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| and made Oklahoma City, if you visited there any time recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| any time in the past 10, 15 years, a pretty amazing place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| So today, as I think back on all those experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| I think this is going to be a place where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| when kids in their 20s are converting vans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| and traveling around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| this is a place they're going to want to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| They're going to want to see a game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| They're going to want to experience Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| They're going to want to come to downtown Knoxville and spend time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| And families that have toddlers at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| that want to go see their first baseball game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| their first soccer game, their first concert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| they're going to go to that venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| They're going to have an awesome time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| And it was interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| Last night, I had a chance to greet and welcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| the newest youth leadership Knoxville class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| And I also got to do this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| And I taught high school last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| And so out of curiosity, I always ask my students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| what are the most exciting things happening in Knoxville to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| What's neat if you're 16, 17 years old?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| What are you excited about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| One of the things they mentioned were the scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| They love the scooters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| They love the scooters downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| So that was pretty high up on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| They mentioned the food hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| They were excited about the food hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| Hey, we can go and choose from 10 different places to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| That's pretty exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| Number one on the list, stadiums coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| We're excited to go see games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| It's going to be where we go hang out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| We can't wait for it to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2994)|
| 0:49:55| Whether it takes a year, two years, three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| whenever it's ready, we're going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| Many of them, let's say a good majority of my classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| are staying here to go to University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| or other regional colleges in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| Might be going to Maryville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| And they were like, so we're going to be here for those games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| It's going to be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| The others that are going away for college, many of them said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| but I want to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| I want to live in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| And this is one of the things that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| going to make this community awesome for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| to come back and experience and enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| So I, for myself, for my family, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| looking forward to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| I think it's the highest and best use for the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| as described by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| And so the items on the agenda that stand up for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| tonight, to me, are very reasonable and prudent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| and a great way to green light this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| And thank you to Randy Boyd and Boyd Sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| for making it possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| Next person signed up to speak on this agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| is Katrin Latham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| Katrin, I'm sorry if I'm not saying it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| Please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| And you will have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3062)|
| 0:51:02| I was correct the first time, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| Katrin Latham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| Address is 9310 Otter Gate Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| And I also come to speak in support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| of 11C and D on the agenda this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| As a young professional in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| I have witnessed, as I'm sure many have the past week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| the influx of students we have coming to UT Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| It's extremely exciting as an alum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| to see everyone come back to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| and starting, once again, the excitement of football season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| being on its way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| However, I've also been here during the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| where it gets a little bit quieter in our lovely city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| Having the Smokies here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| would be an added benefit for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| especially as they predominantly play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| during the times of the year that other major college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| sports are not occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| So the Smokies would give young professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| like myself a reason to come downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| and a great opportunity to enjoy a local sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| team throughout the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| And I believe adding this facility to our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| will encourage more young professionals like myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| to move to the area or stay here after graduating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| from UT Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| So I hope you'll support these resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| Next person signed up to speak in favor is Cole Morgan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| You can come to the podium, state your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3137)|
| 0:52:25| Cole Morgan, 445 West Blount Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| I'm a recent UT graduate and currently a commercial real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| estate agent here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| I decided to stay in Knoxville and pursue a career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| in commercial real estate here because I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| Knoxville has so much untapped potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| and I believe that this proposed stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| is tapping into that potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| It's more than just a stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| Like you said, it's over 100 million in private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| that will create jobs, provide housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| and create new retail and entertainment opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| Like other cities across the U.S. with baseball stadiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| downtown, this stadium will help raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| Knoxville's national profile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| I know that my fellow commercial real estate professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| and the Knoxville Association of Realtors as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| is in full support of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| I've also spoken to dozens of other UT grads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| who decided to stay in Knoxville like I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| and they are in full support and very excited for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| The University of Tennessee and Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| have historically struggled to retain young professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| and UT graduates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| Young professionals want to live in a city that is growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| both economically and socially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| I think this stadium and the private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| that will surround it is a great example of growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| that will help retain more young professionals like myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| Now we're moving to Kent Minow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| who has signed up to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| Mr. Minow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3232)|
| 0:54:02| You'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| You mentioned changing global market conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| in relationship to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| Yeah, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| The world's in a big economic pickle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| Economic-related supply chain issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| have caused a sharp increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| in both the price of building materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| and the price of energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| Not only that, but now interest rates have spiked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| and the financing costs for the stadium are going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| So this proposed amendment allows for no special deals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| on tax rebates and incentives for businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| participating in adjacent development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| along the Magnolia Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| We note all your tax money for those new interest costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| Not only that, but we want to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| the tax increment funding district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| to further increase tax revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| which we can make available to cover these soaring costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| But wait, didn't Randy Boyd say he'd cover the bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| if there was a sudden and unanticipated jump in costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| Instead of $85 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| it's starting to look like $100 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| Now he's come back and said he'll loan us the extra money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| Those financing costs may spike again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| if the Fed does another rate increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| and they said they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| Everyday citizens of Knoxville might think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| that Randy Boyd had just covered this new $20 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| like he promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| After all, he's a billionaire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| A billion is a million a thousand times over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3331)|
| 0:55:37| He could cover the $20 million and still be enormously rich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| How come the city and county are trying to argue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| that these are anticipated costs, not cost overruns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| which Boyd promised he'd pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| So now an increase in anticipated costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| is different from cost overrun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| so Randy Boyd doesn't have to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| and we taxpayers are stuck with the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| A loan will have to pay back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| Well, under certain conditions anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| Mayor and City Council didn't listen to labor advocates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| in the Sierra Club back when it would have made a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| We asked the council to insist on community benefits agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| which would have protected us all with clear language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| and a binding commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| It also would have created a real pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| for low-income Knoxvillians to join union apprenticeship programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| and have career path jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| Now we have nothing in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| and the situation we warned about is upon us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| You need to listen to the people who put you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| Thank you for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| The next person who signed up to speak is Cassie Waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| Cassie Waters, if you could approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| You can start by saying your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| Hi. Cassie Waters, 1424 Cornelia Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| I'm a 14-year homeowner and taxpayer in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| and I also sit on the Board of Jobs with Justice of East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3424)|
| 0:57:09| and just like we have the Industrial Development Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| I hope one day we might have a Workers' Rights Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| So I just have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| Since there is no written and signed community benefits agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| will promises be kept about hiring local construction workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| particularly those from East Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| Having U.S. Department of Labor-approved apprenticeships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| so jobs lead to careers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| Requiring first-rate health and safety protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| on the construction site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| $15.50 per hour minimum wages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| and health insurance for stadium operators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| operations and hospitality workers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| Who will document how many minority contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| are involved in building the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| and how many East Knoxville residents are hired as construction workers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| A written community benefits agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| would have guaranteed documentation and accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| There would have been a way to hold the developer accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| for the agreed benefits to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| Who will hold Randy Boyd accountable for his promises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| A key promise to not come back to the City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| for more than the $65 million has been broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| So this makes us call into question all the promises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| regarding employment and fair treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| To City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| do you think you received the necessary, accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| and transparent information about the projected economic impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| from the stadium, from the mayor and her staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| Did you get the necessary explanations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| about construction terminology and finances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| Is the $480 million in investments spread over 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| from the building of the stadium a realistic projection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| Because that's how it's been sold to the public and City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| Next person signed up to speak against this item is Helen DeHaven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3566)|
| 0:59:35| You could come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| Thank you, Mayor Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| My name is Helen DeHaven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| My address is 6428 Strawberry Plains Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| I am a native of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| and I am the current co-chair of East Tennessee Jobs with Justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| I was here last November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| when this council voted to go forward with the stadium project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| I heard Mr. Boyd refuse categorically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| to sign a community benefits agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| Among other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| the community benefits agreements would have ensured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| that local workers would be hired to build and staff the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| It would have ensured that 40 percent of the construction workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| was hired locally with a priority given to East Knoxville workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| It would have provided United States Department of Labor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| certified apprenticeship training programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| for young and unskilled workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| and that would have led to careers for them beyond the stadium work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3642)|
| 1:00:48| It would have ensured that the staff of the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3648)|
| 1:00:55| would be paid a living wage of at least $15.50 an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| and have decent health benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| We still have no guarantee that these or any other benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| will accrue to the community from the building of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| I also heard that night last November Mr. Boyd give his word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| that if the cost of the project exceeded the $65 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| the city and county were committing from taxpayer money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| he would assume those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| Of the members of the public who spoke that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| many urged you not to move forward without better understandings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| and clearer commitments from Mr. Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| At one point a motion to postpone the vote was on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| It is perhaps a pity that it didn't pass, because here we are again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3706)|
| 1:01:52| because Mr. Boyd did not mean what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| It now appears that the cost of construction will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| millions and millions and millions of dollars higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| than Mr. Boyd initially led the council to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| And last November was a time when construction costs were also going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| This is no surprise, should be no surprise to Mr. Boyd a year later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| Mr. Boyd is not proposing to pay the additional costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| He is proposing once again that the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| and its taxpayers and workers and neighborhoods suffer the disruptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3745)|
| 1:02:31| and bear the costs of the miscalculation in costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| Mr. Boyd is in no position to give even an empty promise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| that an additional $20 million will be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3760)|
| 1:02:45| And no one seems to know if the loan from Mr. Boyd is interest-free or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3765)|
| 1:02:52| Neither the proposal to expand the TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| nor the proposal to increase the interest on the bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| is an adequate solution to the present problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| This is like handing us a plate of hogwash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| and asking us if we'd rather eat it with a spoon or a fork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| We shouldn't be having to eat it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3789)|
| 1:03:17| Jobs with Justice urges you not to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| without a guarantee that the developer cannot pass on additional costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| to the community, however they are characterized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| And we again urge you not to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| without a signed community benefits agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| You now have an opportunity to reopen the matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| and we suggest that it is time that you do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| Council members, a fourth person, I guess a seventh person overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3826)|
| 1:03:52| has signed up to speak in opposition to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| Your rules say six people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| If there's a motion to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| A motion's been made to suspend the rules and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| All those in favor of suspending the rules for this extra person to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| Gary Lowe, you've signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| Please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| You have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3858)|
| 1:04:24| Thank you, Mayor, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| My name's Gary Lowe, PO Box 50444, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37950.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3867)|
| 1:04:36| While it's fresh in our minds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| it's been referenced, the promises made previously by this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3879)|
| 1:04:45| and the assurances you've all received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3885)|
| 1:04:51| First of all, I'd like to start out by saying I speak in respect to everyone here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| and also to Randy Boyd and Doug Kirchhofer and, of course, their PR team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| the Moxley Carmichael team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| But I represent a statewide organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3902)|
| 1:05:07| and it's a community that's concerned about taxation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| And I've spoken to you before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| But let me just play that clip, if I could, of that interaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| First we'll hear from Council Member Andrew Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| and then Deputy to the Mayor Stephanie Welch will respond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| and then we'll also hear from Lauren Ryder, and then Mr. Boyd speaks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| But here's that exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| What I've heard a lot from folks in the community is this notion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| not wanting to make sure that the taxpayers aren't potentially on the hook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| for cost overruns for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| And so we've got a specific model that, as I understand it, is being used here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3944)|
| 1:05:50| which puts the developer at risk for construction cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| So I want to just confirm with you that that is the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| Yes, that is the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| That is Mr. Boyd has agreed to be a developer not just at risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| but he has agreed to take on any cost overruns related to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| We're not going to have anyone ever come back to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| and ask for more money for construction overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| When does it come back to us that we would end up approving an overrun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3978)|
| 1:06:24| if it exceeds the approved amount of funding that you are authorizing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3984)|
| 1:06:30| We can't go over the budget that has been authorized by Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| without coming back to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| And trust me, I do not want to come back to Council to ask for more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| I just wanted to make the point that the developer at risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| or the cost overruns being the responsibility of the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| is why the contracts are framed this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| The responsibility for cost overruns is with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| Therefore, the developer needs to have the ability to manage the budget process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| and not move it into a political process, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| And I would like to restate for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| because I have said before at multiple workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| but Boyd Sports, we are going to guarantee any cost overrun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| We will not come before you and ask you for any additional money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| I will personally make sure that we cover any additional cost that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| That is the end of the interaction on tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4048)|
| 1:07:35| We would like you to hold to that agreement, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| Let's just reflect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| This body has just approved the largest property tax increase in our city's history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4061)|
| 1:07:47| and now you all are seeking more tax revenue to pay for entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| That is not fiscally responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| We must pay our police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| We are entirely for paying them what they deserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| and actually I think they deserve more than what they're receiving now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| We must keep our city safe, but we don't need to tax and spend residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4088)|
| 1:08:14| This will be the third baseball park built for the Tennessee Smokies franchise by Tennessee taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4094)|
| 1:08:23| I think we've paid enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| Council members, that concludes the people signed up to speak to this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| Council Member Parker and Council Member Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4113)|
| 1:08:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| This evening we are being asked to approve an amendment to the interlocal project agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4121)|
| 1:08:48| the next agenda item, an expansion of the TIF district near the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| in order to capture additional taxpayer dollars to dedicate towards stadium construction debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4133)|
| 1:09:01| Tonight I'm urging my colleagues to call a timeout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| until all information pertinent to this project is made available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| and a legally enforceable written instrument to members of City Council and the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4150)|
| 1:09:17| Had we required the developer to present a stadium budget to City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| as part of a fully executed development agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| the developer would have been required under Section 6.5 of the development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4166)|
| 1:09:32| to cover the cost overruns of the stadium construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| Or under Section 5.1, the developer would have been able to negotiate with the sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4176)|
| 1:09:44| on a plan to either lower the cost of the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| or present a request to the city and county for an amendment to the stadium budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| But again, we have yet to be presented with a detailed stadium budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4193)|
| 1:10:00| that includes the plans for stadium improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| As the last speaker has stated at our last meeting on November 12, 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4205)|
| 1:10:12| we were told that the developer was given such oversight over the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4212)|
| 1:10:21| because the developer would be covering cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| That does not seem to be the proposal before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4226)|
| 1:10:31| What I'm asking my colleagues to do is to not rush tonight's vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| and to instead let's take our time and get it right this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| I wanted to share a few concerns that I have after reviewing the documents before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4241)|
| 1:10:52| I've also gone back through the development and lease agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| reviewing the changes that have been made since the first draft was sent to us last November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4257)|
| 1:11:05| And I've attached those comments to our forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| And I apologize that I could not get those to you earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| But these documents have just reached us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| And these are very lengthy documents, especially if we're including the Magnolia Avenue Warehouse redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4276)|
| 1:11:27| And so for that reason, also, I ask that we not make a decision tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4287)|
| 1:11:34| but spend more time so that we can more thoroughly go through the documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4294)|
| 1:11:38| and have an understanding of what we're voting on and what the potential implications are for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4298)|
| 1:11:46| But I must say at the top of my list of concerns is the fact that in order to secure city council support on November 12, 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4306)|
| 1:11:58| we were promised profusely by several individuals in this room, including Randy Boyd himself, that cost overruns would be covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4318)|
| 1:12:09| We held a joint workshop on August 19th, 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| where we were presented with a new financing plan that accounted for $4.5 million in additional money for an increase in the cost of steel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4334)|
| 1:12:25| and $10,725,000 to cover a 16.5% inflation increase, up from an anticipated 6% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4345)|
| 1:12:44| At the time of our meeting on November 12, the developer and all parties involved were perfectly aware that costs are volatile in the construction industry currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4364)|
| 1:12:55| which is why it was important for us that the project was governed by a guaranteed maximum price contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4375)|
| 1:13:04| and for the developer to cover cost overruns as required by the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| All of that was on the table at our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4389)|
| 1:13:14| I'm calling for a workshop on this new proposed financing plan and a public hearing on the Magnolia redevelopment plan and the proposed amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4394)|
| 1:13:26| so that we can have a further review and also so that the public can have a better understanding of what the implications would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4406)|
| 1:13:39| if we were to commit additional taxpayer dollars to the financing of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4419)|
| 1:13:46| And we also need time to have a better understanding of what the implications might be for the redevelopment area for additional tax incentives and abatements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4426)|
| 1:14:00| to be limited and only allowed if approved by the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4440)|
| 1:14:09| I see no reason for us to rush this vote tonight. We've been given no reason to rush the vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4449)|
| 1:14:17| Reasons we have been given in the past is that the developer needs to know that there is support for this proposal moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4457)|
| 1:14:28| And I believe with the city council and the county approval of the interlocal agreement in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4468)|
| 1:14:39| authorizing $65 million in bonds to be issued and guaranteeing backing that $65 million loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4479)|
| 1:14:50| shows the interest and commitment of the city to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4490)|
| 1:14:57| The team owner's company has been selected as the developer and a construction manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4497)|
| 1:15:04| Denark Construction, has been named without protest over the contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| has been named without protest as the contractors without a competitive bidding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4510)|
| 1:15:20| The actions of the city and the county should be and should have been enough for the developer to do his due diligence towards this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4520)|
| 1:15:30| The stadium construction contract with a guaranteed maximum price and a completion guarantee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4530)|
| 1:15:36| as required by Section 6.4.2 of the development agreement, should have been finalized once the interlocal agreement was signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4536)|
| 1:15:44| and the sports authority gave approval to the development and lease agreements in February 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4544)|
| 1:15:50| We have been rushed while the team owner and developer have been allowed to take their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4550)|
| 1:15:59| If we do move forward and Lloyd shall be reimbursed rather than held to cover the cost overruns as promised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4559)|
| 1:16:09| then R&R Land should not maintain control over the budget nor the plans for the capital improvements for the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4569)|
| 1:16:16| and instead the budget designs and plans for the stadium should be required to meet the approval of the public through us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| their elected representatives, before further public financing is approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| and all material changes moving forward that will require an amendment to the stadium budget must come back before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4588)|
| 1:16:37| As has been stated, there are other verbal promises and commitments that have been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4597)|
| 1:16:46| but at this point we cannot rely on simply the word, unfortunately, of the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4606)|
| 1:16:54| A community benefits agreement is still needed to ensure the verbal commitment is upheld,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4614)|
| 1:17:01| to maintain a hyper-local focus of East Knoxville for stadium hires, and ensure livable wages for stadium jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4621)|
| 1:17:10| State law prohibits local governments from entering into agreements with developers that require local hires and set wage requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4630)|
| 1:17:19| State law also prohibits cities from setting our own minimum wage above the state minimum wage, which is $7.25 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4639)|
| 1:17:29| However, we have some tools available to us to influence worker wages in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4649)|
| 1:17:37| Raising the wages of city employees, which we have done, not only raises the wages of our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4657)|
| 1:17:46| but also influences area employers for competitors to raise their wages as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4666)|
| 1:17:53| Another tool is a community benefits agreement, allowing space for legally enforceable community benefits to be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4673)|
| 1:18:01| between a developer that is receiving significant public financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4681)|
| 1:18:08| and a community organization that is able to represent the needs and demands of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4688)|
| 1:18:13| and oversee adherence of the developer to the tenets of the CBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4693)|
| 1:18:19| Another tool is a tool that we can use to ensure that these verbal commitments are actually realized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4699)|
| 1:18:26| and ensure long-term economic benefits to the very community an economic development project is supposed to benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4706)|
| 1:18:36| I believe it's time for us, for Knoxville's leadership, to use all of the tools available to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4716)|
| 1:18:43| to directly address the alarming rates of poverty in our city and especially in the area where the stadium will be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4723)|
| 1:18:51| I'm calling on my colleagues tonight to hit pause until a workshop can be scheduled, a public hearing can be held,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4731)|
| 1:19:01| and until we have all of the details about this project moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4741)|
| 1:19:06| which, as I understand it, will not be until December or January of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4746)|
| 1:19:13| I have additional, that's two pages of comments that I have out of almost 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4753)|
| 1:19:22| I will pause there and allow for further discussion, but I have additional comments and questions. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4762)|
| 1:19:29| Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4769)|
| 1:19:37| Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| Thank you. I would like to call on Deputy Mayor Welch to please explain that what is being asked tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4778)|
| 1:19:46| and it's $20 million, is indeed not a cost overrun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4786)|
| 1:19:52| Yes, thanks, Councilwoman Testerman. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4792)|
| 1:19:58| So in order to answer that question, I just want to reflect on it was great to hear myself in the public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4798)|
| 1:20:05| and a reminder of some of the things that were said during that meeting, some of which were not on the feedback that you heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4805)|
| 1:20:14| The first, which is true, that we would have to come back to council if the stadium budget surpassed what was approved, and here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4814)|
| 1:20:23| And the second was there is no way in the world that I wanted to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4823)|
| 1:20:28| and I think everyone here can understand that that is also true, so here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| Also at that meeting, one of the things that was discussed was the development agreement that Councilwoman Parker was just discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4833)|
| 1:20:41| That development agreement we explained at that time and then further explained at subsequent public sports authority meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4841)|
| 1:20:50| that the agreement would not be executed until we had something that is called in the construction industry a guaranteed maximum price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4850)|
| 1:20:58| and I think I actually used that terminology in that tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| So that is the final cost that all parties agree to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| That's what goes into the contract that Councilwoman Parker was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| Once you have a guaranteed maximum price, and the reason that we referred to that in that terminology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| is that term is very important when you then consider cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4878)|
| 1:21:24| Once you agree to a price, beyond that, cost overrun requirements kick in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4884)|
| 1:21:30| and Mr. Boyd will be on the hook for those cost overruns once we have an agreed upon price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4890)|
| 1:21:37| At that time, we were clear there was a blank space in the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4897)|
| 1:21:43| It was a draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| We were working towards that price in a very volatile construction market that, yes, we were anticipating volatility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4904)|
| 1:21:53| I think that people who work in the industry realize that the volatility in this market has surpassed anything we've seen in any recent history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4913)|
| 1:22:04| So, yes, it has been challenging to get to that guaranteed maximum price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| It is what we have been working toward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| And as we have been working toward that price, costs have continued to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4931)|
| 1:22:18| That's the market that we're in, and it is a very unfortunate situation, but it is a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| And so here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4943)|
| 1:22:24| To go back to the beginning, we said we'd have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| Here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| We're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4948)|
| 1:22:29| What we have come up with, however, is a plan that instead of obligating the city and the county and the sports authority to pay additional debt through the issuance of additional bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4949)|
| 1:22:44| we instead have structured a scenario in which Mr. Boyd is fronting funds that may or may not be repaid depending on investment in the area around the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4964)|
| 1:22:59| So it's not a guaranteed loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| It is an unsecured fronting of money that goes behind the city's repayment in the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4982)|
| 1:23:10| So difference between getting the revenue in place in order to meet our guaranteed maximum cost, guaranteed maximum price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4990)|
| 1:23:18| and where the cost overrun piece that kicks in after that development agreement has been executed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=4998)|
| 1:23:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| Ms. Tessman, did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5016)|
| 1:23:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| Mr. Mametoff, I want to try to put a finer point on what Deputy Mayor Welch was just telling us, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5018)|
| 1:23:49| So we've had a lot of discussion about contracts and agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5029)|
| 1:23:57| I guess the question I have is what triggers the guaranteed payment by Mr. Boyd for cost overruns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5037)|
| 1:24:07| Sorry, Mark Mametoff, 1215 Great Oaks Way, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| If we proceed and we move forward with this project, then the development agreement would move forward to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5051)|
| 1:24:18| They would proceed to go through the bidding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| It looks right now that construction drawings will be finished the latter part of the year and that we would go through the bidding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5061)|
| 1:24:30| While the construction manager was chosen through an RFP process, we would seek at least public bidding on all aspects of the major subcontracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5070)|
| 1:24:43| So after that's done, we should have a guaranteed maximum price, and that would be agreed upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5083)|
| 1:24:49| As Councilwoman Parker said, it would be attached as an exhibit to the development agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5089)|
| 1:24:54| and at that point we would have a maximum amount that the stadium would cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| If after that would have soil conditions that were unexpected, environmental hazards that weren't expected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5099)|
| 1:25:07| unexpected weather conditions that increased costs, all of those risks of construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5107)|
| 1:25:13| which is what we really have spoken with Mr. Boyd about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| was bearing the risk of construction risk and cost overruns that are inherent in any construction project after they happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5117)|
| 1:25:25| So if those things arise and cause the stadium the cost to go over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5125)|
| 1:25:31| and the contractors in the sub ask for adjustments under their contracts due to unusual conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5131)|
| 1:25:37| those are not risks that will be borne by the sports authority or any of the community bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5137)|
| 1:25:43| Okay. So what I think you just did was walk us through all the steps that would have to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5143)|
| 1:25:50| to when you would get a signed development agreement. Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5150)|
| 1:25:55| Yes. I mean, we can't sign the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| I mean, we could sign it with a lot of ifs, ands, and buts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| but when it became apparent earlier in this year that it was not feasible to have a market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5162)|
| 1:26:10| that was deep enough to get adequate bids to get a reasonable price for the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| we did not proceed to sign the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| We did not have a stadium budget in final enough form to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| So the next step would be to finalize that hopefully toward the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| Okay. So then what I'm hearing you say, just to make sure that I got it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5185)|
| 1:26:31| is that what triggers the guaranteed payment by Mr. Boyd for cost overruns is a signed development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5191)|
| 1:26:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5199)|
| 1:26:40| Okay. And then what do you need at this point to get to a signed development agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5200)|
| 1:26:46| What are you lacking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| Well, we're lacking final construction drawings and bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| In a normal time, we had hoped that the design drawings, which are fairly complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5214)|
| 1:27:02| but are not 100% complete, would have been adequate for us to get good pricing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| that we could have attached a budget and gone to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| It became apparent when we tried to bid the project that that was not realistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| and that it was not given supply chain issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| I know you all are tired of hearing the word supply chain issues, but you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5237)|
| 1:27:22| Of this type of a two-year-long construction project, it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5242)|
| 1:27:26| You were just not getting bids for some of the materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| It is starting to calm down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| We are much more hopeful that we'll have a deeper bidding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5250)|
| 1:27:34| We are going to ask for our ask, and they will continue to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| The Sports Authority has their own construction consultant who will be right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| involved in the bidding process to make sure that we get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| Once that process is undertaken and we have a price that's within the available funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5265)|
| 1:27:50| in other words, within what we are asking you all to approve tonight, then we could proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5270)|
| 1:27:56| If for some reason it came back higher than the available funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| if you do approve what we did tonight, then we would not really be able to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5280)|
| 1:28:05| There is still an outside limit, that $20 million, essentially, of additional costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5285)|
| 1:28:11| that if it went over that, we would not be able to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| Is it fair to say that the biggest obstacle to moving forward at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| is that you need construction plans, final construction drawings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| and the proposal that's being brought to Council today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| is requesting an expansion of the TIF district, the Tax Incremental Financing District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5307)|
| 1:28:34| and that Mr. Boyd is going to have an unsecured loan up to $20 million to cover anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5314)|
| 1:28:44| and he only gets paid back after the city and the county get paid back for infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5324)|
| 1:28:50| There's a time limit on that deal of 30 years, I believe. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5330)|
| 1:28:55| That's right. You can't allocate increment from any tax, any parcel, for more than 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5335)|
| 1:29:01| Thank you very much. I appreciate the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| Thank you, Vice Mayor. Council Member McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| Thank you, Mayor. Mr. Mammothoth, if you'd come back to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5347)|
| 1:29:15| So, a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| The first one is, have there been adjustments made in the design to lower costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5357)|
| 1:29:24| since Council and Commission approved our investment in this multi-use stadium project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5364)|
| 1:29:32| I'm so sorry. I couldn't hear the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| Have there been adjustments or changes made in the design of the multi-use stadium since the city and the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5375)|
| 1:29:42| Yes. I'm sorry. Yes, there have been changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| I may not be the best person to give them in detail, but I can certainly give you the high-level changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| The biggest change is they moved the team offices out of the stadium into an adjacent building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5389)|
| 1:29:54| so that removed the cost of constructing that office space as part of the project, and they will absorb that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5394)|
| 1:30:01| So, on top of the other contributions that Mr. Boyd is making for land, roughly $6 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5401)|
| 1:30:07| that he is still making for other costs that we met with you all before, that's not included in this TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5407)|
| 1:30:13| That's additional contribution that he is still making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| They've also taken on the cost of constructing the office space outside the stadium to reduce the cost of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5416)|
| 1:30:22| There are some other things. There are still stands. There are still fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| We're still going to have a good time. It will be a nice stadium, but there are some other adjustments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| slightly smaller boxes. I'm sure Mr. Kirchhofer could give you a better detail than I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5429)|
| 1:30:37| but yes, there was quite a bit of time spent trying to still make this a great public venue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5437)|
| 1:30:44| with total walkability around the stadium so that the public can enjoy it during the daytime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5444)|
| 1:30:51| but to try to reduce the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| One of the main changes, which I found interesting, is we were covering First Creek to a large extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5453)|
| 1:30:58| to provide structural support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| That's been changed significantly so that you'll be able to basically look out over First Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5460)|
| 1:31:05| through some of the things there. There will be an area there that's going to be, I think, really cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| That did help with the reduction of cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5470)|
| 1:31:15| Next question, on the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| Once the development agreement is signed, we will then have a guaranteed maximum cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5478)|
| 1:31:25| Is that a correct statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| Yes, Councilwoman McKenzie. Yes, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| My understanding is when there are guaranteed costs that are given in different projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5490)|
| 1:31:40| that there is a time frame that those costs will be secured at that particular amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5500)|
| 1:31:47| Is that an accurate statement with the development agreement that once it is signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5507)|
| 1:31:52| and there is a guaranteed maximum cost, there will be a certain time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| whether that be 30, 60 days, that these costs, these dollars, are guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5516)|
| 1:32:01| If the project does not start within that window, there's the potential that the cost could again rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5521)|
| 1:32:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5527)|
| 1:32:08| I think that yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| The quick answer, the longer answer, I think, is that as soon as we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| assuming, again, that you all authorize us to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| then as soon as we go through the bidding process and aggregate the numbers, get comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5537)|
| 1:32:22| I think you would see a finalized budget and a signed development agreement very quickly after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5542)|
| 1:32:28| where we would lock in the price as long as it came within the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| that is available to pay for the cost of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5555)|
| 1:32:36| I think I heard you say that the development agreement is anticipated November or December time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5556)|
| 1:32:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5563)|
| 1:32:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| I think right now the likely time to bid out and finalize the drawings is what, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5565)|
| 1:32:52| and if you would like more detail from the team, I'm sure they could give it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| but what we've been told is November, December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| It looks like probably financing would be in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5583)|
| 1:33:04| And then also I do want to address that the Urban League, the contract that was signed with the Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| and I would look to Mr. Boyd and Mr. Kirchhofer to correct me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| that the Urban League, the contract with the Urban League and gym development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5594)|
| 1:33:18| was designed to ensure that there are minority contractors, that there are people from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| that there's outreach, there's sessions done to get them engaged in the stadium project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5603)|
| 1:33:30| and also to provide training to have them prepared for job opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| Is that a correct statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| Yes, that's definitely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| Would you like Mr. Kirchhofer to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| At our sports authority meeting this morning, Mr. Kirchhofer gave an excellent report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| The only good thing, in my judgment, of having to reprice this and not bid it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| is we had a great opportunity to see how our efforts in the DBA area were working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5629)|
| 1:33:55| and to make sure that they're even more enhanced and better prepared when we go back this November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5635)|
| 1:34:00| and they, I thought, did a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| Mr. Kirchhofer gave an excellent report to the sports authority on the efforts that were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| Councilwoman Singh was there, and I don't know if she got to hear the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| but it was quite detailed, and I'm sure Mr. Kirchhofer would be glad to provide that report to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5650)|
| 1:34:16| if he would like to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| Exactly. Thank you. And I'm sorry that I wasn't able to make that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| I did hear some feedback from that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| You didn't miss a lot, but yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| Well, I am in agreement that I do think that it would be appropriate to have a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5665)|
| 1:34:31| where maybe the Urban League and gym development could come and present to us that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| as a council to ensure that we're up to speed on what those efforts look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5676)|
| 1:34:41| and the progress there and the projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| I think that's all the questions I have for now. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5685)|
| 1:34:48| Thank you. Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| I want to start with the definition of cost overrun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5694)|
| 1:35:00| It is an unexpected change in the project budget that ends up increasing the total cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5700)|
| 1:35:05| It can happen due to three primary reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| Economic factors that occur due to inaccuracies in project budget or scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5708)|
| 1:35:13| Technical reasons, including erroneous estimates or incorrect data gathering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5713)|
| 1:35:19| When I left the meeting, I think in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5719)|
| 1:35:25| I left here feeling that I could go to sleep that night because the stadium stuff was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5725)|
| 1:35:32| We had all made agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5732)|
| 1:35:35| We spent a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5735)|
| 1:35:36| There was a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5736)|
| 1:35:37| There were public events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5737)|
| 1:35:38| There were workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| We did a lot of work to get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5739)|
| 1:35:44| I also want to be clear about tonight we're not voting on whether or not there will be a stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5744)|
| 1:35:50| We're figuring out how to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| And I think a lot of work has been put into thinking of a very creative solution on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5753)|
| 1:36:00| So I think there are more solutions we could come up with where it doesn't fall on the taxpayer directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5760)|
| 1:36:06| The last piece, I have more points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5766)|
| 1:36:13| I don't feel, oh, the DBE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| That is at 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| I guess, Doug, if you don't mind talking to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| We actually raised it to 17%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| Is it 17?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| So the other percent, who does that mean gets the 83% of the jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5786)|
| 1:36:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| I'm not totally following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| To me, the minority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5800)|
| 1:36:41| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5801)|
| 1:36:42| That's basically not white men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5802)|
| 1:36:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| It is not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| It includes disabled service veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5809)|
| 1:36:58| It includes minorities, African American, Hispanic American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5818)|
| 1:37:04| And it would also include women-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5824)|
| 1:37:09| So it is a fairly traditional definition of DBE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5829)|
| 1:37:14| We spent a lot of time, and I got legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| I'm not a constitutional DBE expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| I got some help from hiring someone not in my law firm who is an expert in the area to try to help us draft this as broadly and as legally as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5840)|
| 1:37:29| I'm going to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| I'm not going to battle over the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| Yes, that is the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| I'm just saying that 17% to cover that huge group of people is not much at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5856)|
| 1:37:42| I also have some questions, I guess, to Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5862)|
| 1:37:50| When we finally get a guaranteed maximum agreement and we write a check for it, who does the check go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5870)|
| 1:37:59| So there's not a check that goes to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| But there will be a construction fund that will pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5884)|
| 1:38:10| The sports authority will issue bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5890)|
| 1:38:15| The state has contributed $13.5 million, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| So there will be a construction fund, and Mr. Boyd is donating $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| And so that will all be under the purview of the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5908)|
| 1:38:29| And then from who will the sports authority send the money to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| The contract, the agreement is with RR Land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| Who owns RR Land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| RR Land is a company of Mr. Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| So this is a project where, I mean, I don't even know what to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5925)|
| 1:39:02| You're doing well coming and going is what it feels like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| I'm not against the project in itself, but I feel very much lied to at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5947)|
| 1:39:22| Please do not disrupt our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| And that's a very strong feeling for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| So I feel like anything moving forward, I don't feel like I can trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5967)|
| 1:39:33| I think a workshop is a very good place to begin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5973)|
| 1:39:37| because it seems like I have to read every single word of the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5977)|
| 1:39:42| and then go back over it a couple more times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| in order to make sure that what is generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5986)|
| 1:39:53| that we were led to believe something that was not true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| that any costs over what we approved would be covered by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=5997)|
| 1:40:02| And I know that you've been very generous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| I know you've given a lot towards this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| I also know you get a lot from this, both from your hobby and your love,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6007)|
| 1:40:12| but also financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| After the private development is done around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6014)|
| 1:40:19| you had guaranteed like $100 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| How much of that will benefit you as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6022)|
| 1:40:26| I know that somebody I was talking to said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6026)|
| 1:40:30| you've got to approve this, you've got to approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| because there's going to be so much money made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| And I said, okay, how am I going to make money off of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| And they said, you need to buy up land near it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| And I'm like, I'm on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| Do you know what I get paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| So it seemed quite clear that there are going to be winners and losers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6045)|
| 1:40:52| I know that some people are going to do well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| and I know some people are going to get a stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| and they're going to have places to go for entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| But between not having a community benefits agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| at that point I was taking you at your word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| You said, believe me, and I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| So I need a workshop at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| Thank you, Council Member Sands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| Council Member Fugett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| Fugett, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| Just a couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| Well, there's so much to say, but let me start with a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| and I'm not going to ask a private sector developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| I will ask Mr. Bentley to share with me, as a nonprofit housing developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6097)|
| 1:41:49| are we beginning to see contractors offer us prices that they'll guarantee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6109)|
| 1:41:56| Because my understanding was for a while you couldn't get somebody to commit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| to a price for more than about seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| I think that's a very common practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| So if you're asking a general contractor, regardless of the project type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| to hold a price for an extended period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| they're going to bake their risk into those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| So, yeah, you're right in that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| So I do think the other thing, the elephant in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| is we have inflation at a 40-year high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| That is something no one could foresee, a 40-year high in inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6143)|
| 1:42:29| That's blown everything out of the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| That's absolutely right, and I'll make one other comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| We priced a multifamily affordable housing deal about eight, ten months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6155)|
| 1:42:40| and then we priced another very comparable deal about four months after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6160)|
| 1:42:45| and there was about a 20% escalation, same contractor pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| Sure, there's a few minor differences among the two projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6169)|
| 1:42:53| but it's a very unpredictable market no matter what you're trying to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6173)|
| 1:42:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6177)|
| 1:42:58| I just wanted that for context because it's happening to every project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| a for-profit, a not-for-profit project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| I understand people feel the way they feel about things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6186)|
| 1:43:11| I don't believe we were intentionally lied to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| I believe that in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6195)|
| 1:43:19| everybody thought this thing could be built for $65 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| and then we can't build it for $65 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6202)|
| 1:43:26| My hope is that by the time we get to December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6206)|
| 1:43:29| prices have come down on some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| and maybe we won't need the full $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| So there's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| I also think we're –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6217)|
| 1:43:41| I understand the fixation on private sector developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6221)|
| 1:43:45| and people making money off of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| but really this project is, in my opinion, going to benefit our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6227)|
| 1:43:54| We have a parcel of land where nothing has been going on for over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6234)|
| 1:44:01| There is no economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| There is no significant tax base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6244)|
| 1:44:09| and this project is going to generate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| The impact may not be immediate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| but it is adding to the cultural fabric of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6256)|
| 1:44:20| It is something that young people have said they wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| and I just remember when the Smokies moved to Sevier County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| I haven't heard anything but bring them back since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| That doesn't mean we do it willy-nilly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| and it doesn't mean that we write a blank check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| I don't think we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| We will have a fixed-price contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6280)|
| 1:44:45| and after you have a contract price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| that's when things become a cost overrun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| Until you have a contract, you don't have a price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| Once you have a contract, you have a price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| and then you have cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| I also think it's very clear to understand that unsecured means just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6301)|
| 1:45:07| If there's no money to pay Mr. Boyd back, he doesn't get paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6307)|
| 1:45:11| He's the last person in line to get paid back the $20 million loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6311)|
| 1:45:16| and if the taxes don't generate the revenue to pay him back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6316)|
| 1:45:20| after everything else is paid back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| he's made another unintended $20 million contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6323)|
| 1:45:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| Council Member Fugate, Council Member Thomas, and Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| Yes, just a little overview of where I am at the moment on the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6334)|
| 1:45:38| and what got me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| I understand the emotional appeal of baseball, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| Anybody that knows me knows I'm a big baseball fan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6343)|
| 1:45:46| I play a lot of baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| I got in bands and took multi-city road trips like Mr. Brandon Bruce talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6348)|
| 1:45:56| I've gone to many games, even at the old Bill Meyer Stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6356)|
| 1:46:01| and I've still got a few baseball cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| But that can't let me be starry-eyed about my obligations to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6364)|
| 1:46:12| about cost and benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| and I made it very clear at the very beginning of this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6374)|
| 1:46:19| that I'm generally opposed to public financing of professional sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6379)|
| 1:46:26| However, I'm an open-minded guy, so I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| Show me what you got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6389)|
| 1:46:30| If I think this or if I'm shown that this benefit to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6390)|
| 1:46:38| outweighs the cost of the public, sure, I can go for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6398)|
| 1:46:45| I took the process step by step and agreed to where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6405)|
| 1:46:52| I was the one that made the motion to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6412)|
| 1:46:57| and explore more a community benefits agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| to bring in local labor expertise and training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6422)|
| 1:47:07| That was defeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| I think the agreement would be better if we had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6429)|
| 1:47:14| But even I didn't let that kill the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| And so I approved the agreement that we have to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6438)|
| 1:47:27| and I've defended that, my vote on that, with constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6447)|
| 1:47:32| And I am prepared to support the agreement that we had to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6452)|
| 1:47:39| However, these amendments to that agreement, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6459)|
| 1:47:45| are taking us way down that slippery slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6465)|
| 1:47:50| that a lot of municipalities have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| I have lost confidence that what is being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| is going to be a benefit to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6477)|
| 1:48:01| that is better than the cost to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6481)|
| 1:48:07| What we've gotten into is kind of a conundrum of loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6487)|
| 1:48:12| paybacks, expanded TIF districts, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| trying to figure out a way to make these numbers work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| But in my mind, I have extended the, I guess the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6500)|
| 1:48:31| how should I say it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6511)|
| 1:48:35| what the public is willing to contribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6515)|
| 1:48:39| as far as I'm going to extend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6519)|
| 1:48:43| Anything past the agreement that we've already had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6523)|
| 1:48:47| that talked about the $65 million estimate, we can call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6527)|
| 1:48:54| We can call it an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6534)|
| 1:48:57| We can call it cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| Anything that's lacking after that, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| is the duty of the private sector and the free market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6544)|
| 1:49:09| to take up the slack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| I'm not willing to commit any more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| than what we've already committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| Again, I will stand by what we've already committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6556)|
| 1:49:19| I think the cost-benefit works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6559)|
| 1:49:23| But I am, if we vote tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| I will be a no vote on both amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| I won't oppose a workshop to reconsider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| But I am not prepared, based on what I know right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6574)|
| 1:49:39| to extend any kind of contractual or monetary obligations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6579)|
| 1:49:46| from the city to make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6586)|
| 1:49:49| I want it to work, but it's going to have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| the private sector and entrepreneurs who have, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6591)|
| 1:49:57| the means, the ability, and the connections to make it work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6597)|
| 1:50:02| based on what we have already extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6607)|
| 1:50:08| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| I don't want to rehash, I'm not going to rehash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| the stadium concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| I think we did that for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| and there's been plenty of public input on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| I do think we need to dig into the detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| of this change before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| So, this change before us, I just want to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6626)|
| 1:50:31| is a direct result of inflation that was unforeseen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6631)|
| 1:50:36| And so, that doesn't mean we have to pony up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| as much money as we're asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| So, I think that requires due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| and I've had a lot of concerns from people in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6643)|
| 1:50:46| that are worthy, and some of those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| have been asked by the speakers tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| and some of my peers have asked that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| I have a few follow-up questions, just for clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| We are being asked to extend the TIF district area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6657)|
| 1:51:01| in order to pay for this cost increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| And so, I have some clarity to see what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| So, Deputy Welch, just to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6668)|
| 1:51:12| are we spending the city's existing budget on this change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6678)|
| 1:51:19| So, said another way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| are any existing tax dollars going towards this change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| No, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6687)|
| 1:51:28| So, in other words, just as a refresher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6688)|
| 1:51:31| the way TIFs work is that we're expanding an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| incremental revenue that comes in from that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6694)|
| 1:51:37| will be used to pay back the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| And I think one of my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| I can't remember, mentioned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| The loan that we pay back will only be paid to the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| in this case, Mr. Boyd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| if there's enough money generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| as projected from the TIF district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| Is that all correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6714)|
| 1:51:55| So, he will be the last person paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| as it relates to this TIF portion that is being added, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6716)|
| 1:51:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6719)|
| 1:52:00| And there's no money coming from our existing tax dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| particularly those that went to fund police officer raises this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6723)|
| 1:52:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| With that said, I'm not comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| I appreciate Councilmember Thomas' comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| I'm not comfortable with any other additional cash outlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6737)|
| 1:52:21| for this project either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6741)|
| 1:52:24| However, that's why TIF works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6744)|
| 1:52:27| and I think it is the one tool that we have in our tool set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| that I feel comfortable using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| because it's not taking any existing tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| Our budget's not slimmer every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| This is new revenue that would only come from that TIF district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6758)|
| 1:52:43| Now, one thing I will say is, you know, as a refresher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6763)|
| 1:52:48| if this isn't developed, if the stadium's not built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6768)|
| 1:52:50| there will be private development of which the city gets no access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6770)|
| 1:52:56| It'll be private dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| It'll be all profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| Another comment that I've heard that I want to address is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6780)|
| 1:53:05| there are different stages that I've learned about construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6785)|
| 1:53:09| where certain phases happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6789)|
| 1:53:11| there are certain legal documents that kick in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| This is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| So while a community benefits agreement serves a lot of purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6796)|
| 1:53:20| at the end of the day, it's a legal agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| And we have a legal agreement, different, there's multiple versions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| but in other words, a legal agreement is triggering this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6807)|
| 1:53:32| So it's not as if this was just voluntary by anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| We have a legally binding agreement with the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| that forces them to come back before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| to explain the change and for us to assess that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| So while community benefits agreements package as a lot in one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6824)|
| 1:53:49| the essence of it is holding someone accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| to come back before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| And so just to be clear, that's what's happening now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| In terms of cost overruns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| I think it's really important to point out for the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| we see these every two weeks, but not everybody gets to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| You either put risk in the front end of these things or in the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6844)|
| 1:54:09| We've chosen to put it and have the negotiations on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6849)|
| 1:54:13| so that the developer is responsible for the cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6853)|
| 1:54:17| At different stages through construction, the price changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| People give quotes, the price is set, they start construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| they find something bad in the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| it has to get more complex from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| We, every council member, every council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6868)|
| 1:54:31| this body approves almost all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6871)|
| 1:54:34| more dollars for construction projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| because construction dynamics have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| We have two later on tonight, about midnight when we get to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6880)|
| 1:54:44| So we're addressing that change now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6884)|
| 1:54:48| so that the developer is held accountable on cost overruns on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6888)|
| 1:54:54| So when the price is set, we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| The price hasn't been set, which is why we're not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6897)|
| 1:55:00| And so I think it's really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| that we don't do cost overruns with anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| We don't do that with any other developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| We have two items today that proves that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| We had one last council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6910)|
| 1:55:12| where we extended significant dollars for a sidewalk on Western Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6912)|
| 1:55:16| that was critical for that community, and we approved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6916)|
| 1:55:20| So this idea that we're misled if construction costs change is just not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6920)|
| 1:55:26| Now, there are different stages where agreements are made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6926)|
| 1:55:30| and prices are set, and that is the line, the red line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6930)|
| 1:55:35| For me, I don't feel confident, as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6935)|
| 1:55:38| with additional cash outlay from our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| The TIF is the one tool that we have that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| none of your existing tax dollars are going towards this for this extra amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6944)|
| 1:55:49| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6949)|
| 1:55:50| New development for the stadium in that TIF district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| If the stadium is not built, there is no TIF district necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6954)|
| 1:55:58| and development will happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| and those property taxes will come to the city anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| So by tying the TIF district revenue to the success of the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6963)|
| 1:56:09| and making Randy Boyd particularly the last person to pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6969)|
| 1:56:14| we're tying the loan repayment to the success of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6974)|
| 1:56:20| In other words, the stadium doesn't generate the revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6980)|
| 1:56:24| should the loan is not repaid to the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6984)|
| 1:56:29| So in essence, we're incentivizing them to control their own destiny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| without taking any existing tax dollars from our existing constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6993)|
| 1:56:38| I think there's a reasonable argument to vote against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=6998)|
| 1:56:41| so I'm not knocking anybody that wants to vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7001)|
| 1:56:46| I just want to establish some of those real clear facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| because we've heard a lot of things that I feel like aren't representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7008)|
| 1:56:52| of the complex thing that we all have to, at night, in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7012)|
| 1:56:56| midday, take phone calls and evaluate thousands of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7016)|
| 1:57:00| with different perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7020)|
| 1:57:02| We have to weigh all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7022)|
| 1:57:10| Let me ask one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| I think it was clear earlier, but there have been changes to the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7032)|
| 1:57:17| to reduce the cost of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7037)|
| 1:57:20| and I think Mr. Mametoff listed some of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| but have any of the changes in the design reduced the public amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7042)|
| 1:57:26| or the public's access to the stadium as agreed to months ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7046)|
| 1:57:31| Ms. Welch, could you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| No, Councilman Thomas, or Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| No, the design changes have not changed public access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7056)|
| 1:57:40| and in some ways I think providing an opportunity to interact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7060)|
| 1:57:44| with the creek in some ways has enhanced public access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7064)|
| 1:57:48| while helping to get costs down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| I honor and trust your statement, given the gravity of this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7071)|
| 1:57:55| I'd like Mr. Kirchhoff, would you comment on that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7075)|
| 1:58:04| I can repeat the question if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| Pleasure to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| Have any of the design changes due to the impact of these cost increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7088)|
| 1:58:14| reduced public access or public amenities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7094)|
| 1:58:18| By the way, I'm Doug Kirchhoffer with RR Land, PO Box 51887, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7098)|
| 1:58:25| The primary changes had to do with the non-public areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7105)|
| 1:58:30| The concourse itself, the seating bowl, the public amenity space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7110)|
| 1:58:35| is essentially unchanged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| The upper level, the club area, the lounge area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7118)|
| 1:58:44| the event space that can be used on non-baseball, non-soccer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7124)|
| 1:58:49| non-event days for other types of activities is still in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7129)|
| 1:58:54| We've reduced the amount of potential retail space that was planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7134)|
| 1:59:01| that was not really part of the stadium but would have been beneficial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7141)|
| 1:59:05| because it would have generated additional sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7145)|
| 1:59:08| and helped with the funding equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7148)|
| 1:59:12| The movement of the offices was a significant reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| Those are going into one of the adjacent buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7156)|
| 1:59:20| one of the private buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7160)|
| 1:59:22| so that they will not be part of the stadium cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7162)|
| 1:59:25| And the lower level, the area called the service level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7165)|
| 1:59:30| where the locker rooms and other stadium function non-public space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7170)|
| 1:59:36| has been rearranged to make it more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7176)|
| 1:59:39| and to reduce costs down there as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| without impacting the usability or the function of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7182)|
| 1:59:47| Thank you. One more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| Will you lose profit as a result of these reduced design changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7189)|
| 1:59:55| Well, because of the size of the stadium itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7195)|
| 1:59:58| and the capacity and so forth, it should be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7198)|
| 2:00:03| It shouldn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7203)|
| 2:00:05| The main difference is the cost of the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7205)|
| 2:00:08| one of the significant differences would be the cost of providing office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7208)|
| 2:00:12| Typically in a stadium like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| the team and the landlord's offices are within the complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7214)|
| 2:00:19| and are sort of included in the rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| In our case, that won't be the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| We'll be either purchasing or renting space privately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| without coming back to the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| And one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7233)|
| 2:00:34| Just speaking of rent, will your rent change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7234)|
| 2:00:37| in terms of how much you're paying the city every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7237)|
| 2:00:40| No, that remains the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7240)|
| 2:00:42| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7242)|
| 2:00:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7244)|
| 2:00:45| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| Deputy Welch, I have a couple of questions here to focus on the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7250)|
| 2:00:55| which is actually what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7255)|
| 2:00:59| I appreciate some of the comments from Council Member Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7259)|
| 2:01:02| about the TIF district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| So, Deputy Welch, in the packet on this agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7264)|
| 2:01:11| there's Exhibit B, which is the Parcels in TIF District and Base Taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7271)|
| 2:01:16| I'm sorry, what page are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7276)|
| 2:01:19| 288 in the packet, Exhibit B, Parcels in the TIF District and Base Taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7279)|
| 2:01:26| And these are available to the public on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7286)|
| 2:01:31| And then, okay, I think I answered one of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7291)|
| 2:01:38| This is Appraisal and Assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7298)|
| 2:01:41| So there's that chart, and then there's also the chart that's just below it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7301)|
| 2:01:46| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7306)|
| 2:01:47| Let's see if I got things in the right order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| Exhibit C, which is Parcels in the TIF District and the Base Taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7310)|
| 2:01:54| I guess one is, can you tell me what the difference in the two charts are, Deputy Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7314)|
| 2:02:00| I think one has 2021 appraised and assessed values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7320)|
| 2:02:04| but I don't know what the values are in the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7324)|
| 2:02:08| without being able to lay them out side by side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7328)|
| 2:02:11| So Exhibit C, I believe that's the 2021 Base Tax year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7331)|
| 2:02:15| I think Mr. Bentley, is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7335)|
| 2:02:19| Mr. Bentley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| He may have stepped out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7341)|
| 2:02:23| Oh, he's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7343)|
| 2:02:24| Oh, one just includes the assessment and the appraisal amounts as well as the tax amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7344)|
| 2:02:29| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7349)|
| 2:02:30| Yeah, I think you answered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| So when you go through the different tables and charts and you compare them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| All right, so you don't need to look at both unless you want to see the different amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| So let's just take, it doesn't matter which one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| Can I interject real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7361)|
| 2:02:42| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7362)|
| 2:02:43| So we did figure out after further assessment with council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7363)|
| 2:02:46| that one of them is the plan that you all previously approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7366)|
| 2:02:50| So it's the list of parcels included in the original TIF district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7370)|
| 2:02:54| The other is the newly proposed parcels within the expanded TIF district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7378)|
| 2:02:59| That's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7379)|
| 2:03:00| So which one's which?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7380)|
| 2:03:01| Exhibit C is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7381)|
| 2:03:04| The one with more parcels is the newly proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7384)|
| 2:03:07| Do you want me to sit here and count them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7387)|
| 2:03:09| Because we really will take until midnight if you want me to count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| 286.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7391)|
| 2:03:12| 299 is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7392)|
| 2:03:13| 286 is the newest one you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7393)|
| 2:03:18| Exhibit B is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| Page 289 of your packet is exhibit B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7400)|
| 2:03:25| That's the expanded district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7405)|
| 2:03:28| Okay, 289, exhibit B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| Okay, of the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| Okay, so I see parcels in here that are, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7413)|
| 2:03:40| Let's go with, I don't know, assessment values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7420)|
| 2:03:44| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7424)|
| 2:03:46| Some of the parcels are $25,000, $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7426)|
| 2:03:50| I see something for a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| I see a whole bunch of zeros.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| Zero, zero, zero, zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7434)|
| 2:03:55| So these properties are valued at $0?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7435)|
| 2:03:59| Those are probably properties that are not taxable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7439)|
| 2:04:03| Yeah, these are non-taxable properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7443)|
| 2:04:04| There's a whole lot of KUB, KCDC, different owned properties in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7444)|
| 2:04:10| Where are the new properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7450)|
| 2:04:11| Or how many new properties are we talking in this TIF district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7451)|
| 2:04:15| Do you know the difference in the two tables?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7455)|
| 2:04:17| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7457)|
| 2:04:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7458)|
| 2:04:19| I can get that number for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7459)|
| 2:04:20| And I am really sorry, Deputy Mayor Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7460)|
| 2:04:23| that I did not know that at 730 this morning as a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| No, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7466)|
| 2:04:27| We can get you that information, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| Okay, as to the number of parcel differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7469)|
| 2:04:32| Okay, but if I scroll up above that chart is the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7472)|
| 2:04:37| there's several different maps in here to talk about what the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| that's the project area, so hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7480)|
| 2:04:42| Everybody bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7482)|
| 2:04:44| Scroll down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7484)|
| 2:04:47| The map on 296.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7487)|
| 2:04:52| Do you see that, the Exhibit A, the map that shows the purple boundary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7492)|
| 2:04:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7497)|
| 2:04:58| And then the little red boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| Is that all we're talking about expanding the TIF district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| The map that expands the TIF district is on page, let me go to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7504)|
| 2:05:10| it is on page 288.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7510)|
| 2:05:16| So on page 288, there is a map that has, it has the purple boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7516)|
| 2:05:22| which is the Magnolia Avenue Warehouse District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7522)|
| 2:05:26| There is a blue boundary inside that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7526)|
| 2:05:29| That's the original TIF district that you all approved a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7529)|
| 2:05:33| The blue boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7533)|
| 2:05:34| The blue boundary, the one that you've already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7534)|
| 2:05:37| And then the red outlined boundary includes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7537)|
| 2:05:41| which includes the blue boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| The red outlined boundary is the new expanded boundary line for the TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7543)|
| 2:05:48| district expansion that's being proposed to you as part of tonight's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7548)|
| 2:05:52| resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7552)|
| 2:05:54| Okay, so what's the one on 296 do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7554)|
| 2:05:56| That is the old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7556)|
| 2:05:58| Oh, it's the old Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7558)|
| 2:06:00| That's the old, that is the old map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| That's the blue, the blue boundary on page 297 is the same outline as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7562)|
| 2:06:08| the blue boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| And then on 296, that's the expanded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7570)|
| 2:06:13| we slightly expanded the Magnolia redevelopment area to incorporate a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7573)|
| 2:06:17| couple more blocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7577)|
| 2:06:19| So the 296.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7579)|
| 2:06:20| The little red part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7580)|
| 2:06:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7581)|
| 2:06:22| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7582)|
| 2:06:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7583)|
| 2:06:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7584)|
| 2:06:25| Appreciate the clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7585)|
| 2:06:28| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| Your lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7593)|
| 2:06:37| So a lot to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7597)|
| 2:06:41| Following the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7601)|
| 2:06:47| At the top of the list, I still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| Are you that we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7610)|
| 2:06:54| Moving forward, not in the proper order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7614)|
| 2:06:58| And that we need to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7618)|
| 2:07:02| A finalized development agreement before discussing further financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7622)|
| 2:07:07| If you look at section 5.1.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7627)|
| 2:07:10| At the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| It allows for a stadium budget to be set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7633)|
| 2:07:17| Once the agreement is finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7637)|
| 2:07:20| And then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7640)|
| 2:07:22| At that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7642)|
| 2:07:25| After a bidding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7645)|
| 2:07:27| Once the results of that process are collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7647)|
| 2:07:30| The development agreement allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7650)|
| 2:07:33| For a revision to the stadium budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7653)|
| 2:07:36| That's included in the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7656)|
| 2:07:39| So there are already mechanisms in the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7659)|
| 2:07:42| Mechanisms that I don't necessarily like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7662)|
| 2:07:45| But allow for future changes to the stadium budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7665)|
| 2:07:49| But having no agreements in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| While we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7671)|
| 2:07:54| Financing for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7674)|
| 2:07:57| Gives no protections to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| And it sends no message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| To the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| To not come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7684)|
| 2:08:06| For further and further and further request for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7689)|
| 2:08:13| So the development needs to be executed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7693)|
| 2:08:17| We also have no documentation in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| To make a loan to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7701)|
| 2:08:25| The language we have in front of us says in the interlocal agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7705)|
| 2:08:30| That we will limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7710)|
| 2:08:32| The tax incentives and tax abatements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7712)|
| 2:08:36| So that Casey DC will have access to additional revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7716)|
| 2:08:40| To service debt on the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7720)|
| 2:08:44| Under the redevelopment agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| It states that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7727)|
| 2:08:50| Casey DC will take on 50 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7730)|
| 2:08:57| Of which.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7737)|
| 2:09:01| Funding may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7741)|
| 2:09:04| Provided by a member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| Of the team or something really vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7747)|
| 2:09:10| It is extremely vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| And it is something that I consider a binding language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7752)|
| 2:09:16| That would require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7756)|
| 2:09:18| Randy Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| Our, our land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7760)|
| 2:09:21| Boyd sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7761)|
| 2:09:23| To provide the funding necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7763)|
| 2:09:26| To cover these costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7766)|
| 2:09:29| But the language in the agreement does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7769)|
| 2:09:32| Obligate the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7772)|
| 2:09:34| To ensure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7774)|
| 2:09:36| These costs are covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7776)|
| 2:09:40| It is extremely irresponsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| For us to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7782)|
| 2:09:44| Without getting those guarantees and agreements in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7784)|
| 2:09:50| I'm further discouraged by hearing the discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7790)|
| 2:09:54| About cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7794)|
| 2:09:56| Because the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7796)|
| 2:09:58| Is very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7798)|
| 2:10:00| On what the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7800)|
| 2:10:02| Of a cost overrun is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7802)|
| 2:10:04| According to the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7804)|
| 2:10:07| The developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| Shall be responsible for any cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| Second sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| The term cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| As used in this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| Shall mean the amount by which stadium costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7819)|
| 2:10:22| Exceed the stadium budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7822)|
| 2:10:25| Provided that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7825)|
| 2:10:26| Two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7826)|
| 2:10:28| The cost overruns haven't resulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7828)|
| 2:10:31| From.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| An action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7833)|
| 2:10:36| Or request by the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7836)|
| 2:10:40| Or the cost of a run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7840)|
| 2:10:44| Was not a result of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7844)|
| 2:10:48| Another part of the agreement that requires another party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7848)|
| 2:10:51| Other than the developer to cover that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7851)|
| 2:10:54| Neither.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| Of those issues is what we're dealing with today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7857)|
| 2:11:02| We're not dealing with the cost of a run that was created because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7862)|
| 2:11:05| authority made additional requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| Regarding the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7867)|
| 2:11:09| We're not talking about a cost of a run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| That some party to this agreement should be paying other than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7872)|
| 2:11:15| developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7875)|
| 2:11:18| We are simply talking about cost overruns because when this came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7878)|
| 2:11:22| before us in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7882)|
| 2:11:26| We were told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7886)|
| 2:11:28| That we were, we did not need the stadium budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| Because the developer would cover all cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| And should be given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7894)|
| 2:11:37| Full discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7897)|
| 2:11:39| When it came to that stadium budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7899)|
| 2:11:42| We were not told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7904)|
| 2:11:45| I heard something that we were told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| That even after we made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7907)|
| 2:11:50| The vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7910)|
| 2:11:51| There was still be work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| To reach a guaranteed maximum price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7913)|
| 2:11:56| None of that took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7916)|
| 2:11:57| Do you know how many times I've watched that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7917)|
| 2:12:01| That conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| Did not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7923)|
| 2:12:04| What did happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| Were profuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7926)|
| 2:12:10| Commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7930)|
| 2:12:12| Guarantees promises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7932)|
| 2:12:15| Lies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| That were told to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| About the financing moving forward, which was that Randy Boyd would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7940)|
| 2:12:23| cover the cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7943)|
| 2:12:26| We are educated individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7946)|
| 2:12:28| We can read what comes before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| Even if you only give us a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7950)|
| 2:12:32| We can read through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7952)|
| 2:12:34| And the language around cost overruns was clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7954)|
| 2:12:37| And at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7957)|
| 2:12:39| I was told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7959)|
| 2:12:40| And I'm pretty sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7960)|
| 2:12:42| All of my colleagues on council were told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7962)|
| 2:12:45| That the development and lease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7965)|
| 2:12:48| Would be signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7968)|
| 2:12:50| By January, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7970)|
| 2:12:53| And that the time between our meeting in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7973)|
| 2:12:57| And the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| Meeting in January was our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7979)|
| 2:13:02| To influence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7982)|
| 2:13:04| The final details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7984)|
| 2:13:06| Of that development and lease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7986)|
| 2:13:09| So we signed an interlocal agreement with the assurances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7989)|
| 2:13:14| That the development and lease agreement that held the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| To the tenants of the agreement that as we understood it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=7998)|
| 2:13:22| Would shortly be signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8002)|
| 2:13:25| After we signed the interlocal agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8005)|
| 2:13:28| And yet here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8008)|
| 2:13:31| Nine months later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8011)|
| 2:13:33| And those agreements have not been signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8013)|
| 2:13:36| And the developer has not moved forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8016)|
| 2:13:38| On the promises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8018)|
| 2:13:40| Made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| I just want to say once again, the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| Has a process under section 5.1 0.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8025)|
| 2:13:50| That allows the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8030)|
| 2:13:52| To move forward with the bidding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8032)|
| 2:13:54| Bring the results from that bidding process back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8034)|

| 2:14:05| The bids that we received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| Are not within the range that we anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8047)|
| 2:14:12| But what has come before us today is none of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8052)|
| 2:14:16| It has not been about bidding process held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8056)|
| 2:14:19| To my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8059)|
| 2:14:22| We certainly do not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8062)|
| 2:14:24| The results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| Of a bidding process shared with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8066)|
| 2:14:30| The agreements have not been finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8070)|
| 2:14:34| I've spoken with KB, Casey, DC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8074)|
| 2:14:38| About the, I would like a copy of the redevelopment agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8078)|
| 2:14:41| It hasn't been finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| Casey, DC doesn't have the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8083)|
| 2:14:45| What has the developer been doing over the last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8085)|
| 2:14:49| The utility agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8089)|
| 2:14:52| The full utility agreements are not in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8092)|
| 2:14:56| When I talked to KB about the expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8096)|
| 2:15:00| That will be taken on for those improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| It was clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8103)|
| 2:15:06| That these, this type of assistance is not going to be offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8106)|
| 2:15:11| To every development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8111)|
| 2:15:14| Yet every development in that area is going to have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8114)|
| 2:15:18| This industrial site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8118)|
| 2:15:21| With piping from 1940s, that all needs to be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8121)|
| 2:15:26| So when we expand this TIF district and funnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8126)|
| 2:15:30| All those financial incentives to the stadium project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8130)|
| 2:15:34| What financial incentives will we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8134)|
| 2:15:37| To encourage additional development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| What do we need to actually pay off the debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8141)|
| 2:15:44| That we're committing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8144)|
| 2:15:47| We need so many more details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8147)|
| 2:15:50| To make a good decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8150)|
| 2:15:52| About this stadium project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8152)|
| 2:15:55| Workforce development agreement was mentioned with Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| I've asked for a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8159)|
| 2:16:02| And I hope to get it soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8162)|
| 2:16:03| I have not received it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8163)|
| 2:16:06| When I saw reading through updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8166)|
| 2:16:10| To the development and lease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8170)|
| 2:16:12| The Urban League was actually taken out of those agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8172)|
| 2:16:15| And it's not specifically named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8175)|
| 2:16:17| To give the developer more flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8177)|
| 2:16:20| So folks felt like the Urban League was a trusted community member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8180)|
| 2:16:25| To serve in this role for the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8185)|
| 2:16:27| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| They're not necessarily written into the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8189)|
| 2:16:34| But as I've argued before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8194)|
| 2:16:37| We need more oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8197)|
| 2:16:41| A diversity coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8201)|
| 2:16:45| Hired by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| And not serve in an oversight role for the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8208)|
| 2:16:54| I keep hearing language about if we're authorized to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8214)|
| 2:17:02| The authority to move forward has already been given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8222)|
| 2:17:05| $65 million in bonds has already been authorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8225)|
| 2:17:11| What has not moved forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8231)|
| 2:17:13| What has not continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8233)|
| 2:17:16| Is Randy Boyd's commitment to cover up cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8236)|
| 2:17:19| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8239)|
| 2:17:22| There's no questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8242)|
| 2:17:25| You know, city, county commitment and all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8245)|
| 2:17:29| Now, we cannot throw out the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8249)|
| 2:17:34| Our role as being good stewards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8254)|
| 2:17:37| Just to show, give a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8257)|
| 2:17:40| To a developer that we give support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8260)|
| 2:17:43| To a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| That's not a good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| To sign an amended interlocal agreement tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8267)|
| 2:17:51| And that's a reason that's been used in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8271)|
| 2:17:56| I have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8276)|
| 2:17:58| Just like I did in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| I haven't even scratched the surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8280)|
| 2:18:02| I haven't even gone through my document page by page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8282)|
| 2:18:06| And I regretted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8286)|
| 2:18:09| At our November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8289)|
| 2:18:11| That I didn't go through each point that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8291)|
| 2:18:15| Because discussion was cut off so short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8295)|
| 2:18:19| And I was frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8299)|
| 2:18:22| I had a little bit of hope last November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8302)|
| 2:18:26| That we would actually hold a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8306)|
| 2:18:30| I had a little hope last November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8310)|
| 2:18:35| That there would be some agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8315)|
| 2:18:38| That we needed more time with these documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8318)|
| 2:18:41| And more time understanding what we were voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8321)|
| 2:18:46| That perhaps I was a bit naive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8326)|
| 2:18:50| So tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8330)|
| 2:18:53| I'm struggling with what to do, quite honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8333)|
| 2:18:57| I don't know if we have the votes for a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8337)|
| 2:19:01| Based on the discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8341)|
| 2:19:05| I don't know if we have the votes for a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8345)|
| 2:19:09| But we need to thoroughly go through these documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8349)|
| 2:19:14| So do we try to do it tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8354)|
| 2:19:18| Spend another couple of hours discussing about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8358)|
| 2:19:21| Or do we send this to a workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8361)|
| 2:19:25| Where we can really gain an understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8365)|
| 2:19:29| And some clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8369)|
| 2:19:32| Around what the potential implications might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8372)|
| 2:19:36| For these new proposed plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8376)|
| 2:19:40| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8380)|
| 2:19:41| Several of your colleagues have their lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8381)|
| 2:19:45| Usually after some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8385)|
| 2:19:47| It's an opportunity to give them a chance to speak too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8387)|
| 2:19:53| I think I need to finish just a few more points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8393)|
| 2:20:03| I wanted to emphasize this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8403)|
| 2:20:05| Because I keep hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8405)|
| 2:20:08| That what we're voting on tonight is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8408)|
| 2:20:11| An obligation of current tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8411)|
| 2:20:14| It's not money that will come directly out of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8414)|
| 2:20:20| However.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8420)|
| 2:20:23| It is taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8423)|
| 2:20:25| That we have to be good stewards of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| And it's taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| That are meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| For this redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| Not just one building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8433)|
| 2:20:35| Not just the stadium and the condos that surround it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8435)|
| 2:20:40| But a whole area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8440)|
| 2:20:42| We're trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8442)|
| 2:20:43| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8443)|
| 2:20:44| To change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8444)|
| 2:20:46| I've heard a lot of reference to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8446)|
| 2:20:49| The south Knoxville waterfront redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8449)|
| 2:20:52| In the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8452)|
| 2:20:54| I mean we certainly haven't given space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8454)|
| 2:20:56| To have these conversations of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8456)|
| 2:20:59| But I've read news articles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8459)|
| 2:21:01| Just like you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8461)|
| 2:21:03| And I would like to know more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8463)|
| 2:21:06| Because I want to prevent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| The mistakes that have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8468)|
| 2:21:09| Because there have been mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| And I want to copy the good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8471)|
| 2:21:14| Learn from what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8474)|
| 2:21:17| And move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| And when I think about what I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| Of the south Knoxville waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| I don't believe it's one project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8483)|
| 2:21:26| That got all the financial support from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8486)|
| 2:21:30| To create what we see over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8490)|
| 2:21:33| We're talking about one project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| Essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8495)|
| 2:21:37| Sucking up all the support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8497)|
| 2:21:39| What will that mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8499)|
| 2:21:41| For this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8501)|

| 2:23:17| presentation made at our workshop on the financing plan for the stadium that in August 2.4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8597)|
| 2:23:27| was added, I think it was 2.4 million, for retail space on Jackson. Is that a part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8607)|
| 2:23:34| the retail space that's going to be removed? Overall, any reduction in retail space, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8614)|
| 2:23:41| does that impact the overall output of this project? There was another, okay, I have about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8621)|
| 2:23:59| 20 more comments, so I will pause there, but I will stop with a couple of things. One is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8639)|
| 2:24:08| going through the Magnolia Avenue redevelopment plan for me, and it's my first time reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8648)|
| 2:24:13| through this plan developed in 2011, was an opportunity for me to see what could be possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8653)|
| 2:24:22| and what the community has come together to say is their vision for this area. And of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8662)|
| 2:24:28| course, basal stadium was not included, just in case y'all were wondering. And what I saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8668)|
| 2:24:35| were, you know, a community that had been developed where I imagined different lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8675)|
| 2:24:42| that I'm looking at would hopefully have different owners and different individuals in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8682)|
| 2:24:48| who are able to benefit from this economic development plan. With the stadium, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8688)|
| 2:24:56| see that. And I think we have to worry about, I think we have to rethink about whether this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8696)|
| 2:25:05| is the highest and best use of this property, because I still am not convinced that it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8705)|
| 2:25:11| especially with no parking plan in place. And I have a whole page where I talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8711)|
| 2:25:17| that because there have been new updates as projects like Caldonia Flats, you know, transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8717)|
| 2:25:24| parking lots into residential. We need to have an understanding where folks are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8724)|
| 2:25:28| to park. And so I'm not convinced that's the highest and best use. And since we don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8728)|
| 2:25:38| the final cost on the stadium, we cannot at this point say that the benefits will outweigh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8738)|
| 2:25:46| the cost. We all know what the costs are going to be. So I'm asking my colleagues to at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8746)|
| 2:25:52| wait to vote on this until we know what the final cost will be, knowing that amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8752)|
| 2:26:01| may come, but we at least need a stadium budget in front of us that tells us what the expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8761)|
| 2:26:07| is today. Thank you, Ms. Parker. Councilmembers, just two comments I wanted to add. First,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8767)|
| 2:26:19| this proposal does not add to the tax burden of the city of Knoxville or the people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8779)|
| 2:26:24| pay the city of Knoxville taxes. Just want to make that abundantly clear. The expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8784)|
| 2:26:29| of the TIF district does not do that. Also, I just wanted to share that when I speak with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8789)|
| 2:26:36| people from other communities, mayors from other cities, and they talk about projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8796)|
| 2:26:41| in their city, stadiums, municipal stadiums, more typically a city has to spend 100 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8801)|
| 2:26:48| of the money to build a public stadium, and then they have to recruit a team or teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8808)|
| 2:26:53| to come use that facility. We are in a much more fortunate position. We have, thanks to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8813)|
| 2:27:00| Knox County and thanks to the state of Tennessee, the city of Knoxville taxpayers are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8820)|
| 2:27:04| to be covering less than half of the cost of this public stadium. We will own it through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8824)|
| 2:27:09| the sports authority, and we have the most beneficial lease agreement ever negotiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8829)|
| 2:27:17| in the history of minor league baseball, and I am just reiterating that that's an unusually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8837)|
| 2:27:23| fortunate situation for the city, and I think the benefits far exceed the cost, and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8843)|
| 2:27:30| done our due diligence, and I look forward to your support for this. I'll call on, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8850)|
| 2:27:35| think I'll go with Ms. Fugate, and then Councilmember Smith. Just a quick question. So the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8855)|
| 2:27:44| has already committed their tax dollars to the $20 million loan, correct? The TIF. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8864)|
| 2:27:52| They've committed that their portion of county taxes within the expanded TIF will do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8872)|
| 2:27:58| so they voted unanimously last night to commit their tax increment to this project in East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8878)|
| 2:28:06| Knoxville, east of downtown. So we're the only body that has not, is that correct? Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8886)|
| 2:28:18| Mr. Smith? Thank you, Mayor. Just two questions. One for Mr. Mametsov. What is the, don't act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8898)|
| 2:28:29| so excited to come back. We're all extremely excited to be here again, so cheer up. There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8909)|
| 2:28:41| was a mention about cost overruns once a budget, a cost overrun, we've talked a lot about cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8921)|
| 2:28:47| overruns, but cost overruns, as I understand it so far, are established once a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8927)|
| 2:28:52| quote, once a budget has been established. Is that correct? Yes. Has a budget been established?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8932)|
| 2:28:58| No. Okay. Well, I appreciate the concern about sequence of events. Just to be clear, cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8938)|
| 2:29:04| overruns have, the clock has not started because the agreement has not been signed. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8944)|
| 2:29:09| correct? That's correct. Thank you. And then one for Deputy Welch. Has council been provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8949)|
| 2:29:15| the DBE agreement with the Urban League? Yes. That was requested by Councilwoman Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8955)|
