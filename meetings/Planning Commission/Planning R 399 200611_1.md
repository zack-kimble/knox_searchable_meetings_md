| 2:36:13| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9373)|
| 2:36:14| Could we please go to Ms. Albertson and hear the reasoning why staff is denying this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9374)|
| 2:36:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9383)|
| 2:36:25| Sorry, this is Liz Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9385)|
| 2:36:27| I'm happy to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9387)|
| 2:36:28| Gerald, did you want to pipe in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9388)|
| 2:36:30| I'll let you go first, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9390)|
| 2:36:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9391)|
| 2:36:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9392)|
| 2:36:33| I'm going to reiterate and emphasize basically what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9393)|
| 2:36:38| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9398)|
| 2:36:40| If we could pull up the staff report, that would be helpful, Taryn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9400)|
| 2:36:52| And if we could scroll down to that first section there, the proposed amendment shall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9412)|
| 2:36:59| be necessary because of substantially changed or changing conditions in the area and districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9419)|
| 2:37:05| affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9425)|
| 2:37:06| So this segment of Chapman Highway is coming out of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9426)|
| 2:37:11| It's near the entrance to Fort Dickerson Park, and it was noted in the Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9431)|
| 2:37:18| Implementation Plan as being an area that's likely to have the highest pedestrian, bicycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9438)|
| 2:37:23| and transit activity of any section of the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9443)|
| 2:37:28| The Chapman Highway Implementation Plan was just adopted in 2019, and several improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9448)|
| 2:37:36| were called out to help make this section of the Chapman Highway area more pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9456)|
| 2:37:46| in character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9466)|
| 2:37:47| If we scroll down, Taryn, to some of the exhibit maps that we've provided, let's see, contextual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9467)|
| 2:37:57| maps, I think one more page, two more, actually the very next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9477)|
| 2:38:08| Thank you, right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9488)|
| 2:38:09| So on the right-hand side of your screen here, you see the locations of prioritized projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9489)|
| 2:38:21| that are part of the Chapman Highway Implementation Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9501)|
| 2:38:25| Here we can see the section between Blunt Avenue down past the intersection with Woodlawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9505)|
| 2:38:34| Pike, so past the entrance to the Fort Dickerson area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9514)|
| 2:38:41| There are several projects that have been called out as Tier 1 projects, so this means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9521)|
| 2:38:47| that, and feel free to correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9527)|
| 2:38:51| transportation staff, that these are likely to be highly prioritized projects by both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9531)|
| 2:38:57| the City of Knoxville and TDOT hopefully moving forward for improvements to this section of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9537)|
| 2:39:05| the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9545)|
| 2:39:07| You can see things, for instance, the yellow area there talks about the addition of a median,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9547)|
| 2:39:14| and some additional bicycle and pedestrian improvements are shown in green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9554)|
| 2:39:19| So although there have historically been some highway commercial uses there, and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9559)|
| 2:39:23| are still some remnant uses, you know, this area is still adjacent to the Fort Dickerson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9563)|
| 2:39:31| Park, which is part of the urban wilderness area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9571)|
| 2:39:34| We've seen increasing interest in bike and pedestrian activity in and around the downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9574)|
| 2:39:39| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9579)|
| 2:39:41| You know, highway commercial is more appropriate further down Chapman Highway, but at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9581)|
| 2:39:46| location, staff feels that the CG2 designation, which calls for lesser intense commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9586)|
| 2:39:53| uses, as being more appropriate for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9593)|
| 2:40:00| So that's our rationale behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9600)|
| 2:40:04| And the sector plan and one-year plan descriptions of these areas also say, you know, very similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9604)|
| 2:40:13| things related to a potential increase in pedestrian activity and pedestrian type development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9613)|
| 2:40:21| in this section of the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9621)|
| 2:40:24| Thank you very much, Ms. Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9624)|
| 2:40:26| With that, I would like to make a motion to deny CH1 highway commercial zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9626)|
| 2:40:34| because higher intensity commercial units uses of a predominantly auto-oriented character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9634)|
| 2:40:41| permitted by this zone district are not in line with the one-year plan, south sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9641)|
| 2:40:46| plan, nor the Chapman Highway implementation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9646)|
| 2:40:50| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9650)|
| 2:40:53| We have a motion by Commissioner Buston, a second by Commissioner Phillips to deny the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9653)|
| 2:40:58| CH1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9658)|
| 2:41:00| Mr. Green, did you have anything else that you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9660)|
| 2:41:03| Not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9663)|
| 2:41:04| I'd just like to emphasize the plans create a vision for this area that is more pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9664)|
| 2:41:12| friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9672)|
| 2:41:12| The area was identified by the city through many efforts as a primary area for more pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9672)|
| 2:41:21| oriented development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9681)|
| 2:41:22| The CG2 permits a higher intensity development in terms of the height, the reduced setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9682)|
| 2:41:29| than the CH1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| So the potential for development is actually enhanced to some degree by the CG2 and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9691)|
| 2:41:38| return on the investment that can be made on this property through the CG2 is certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9698)|
| 2:41:45| something that Ms. Bailey should look forward to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9705)|
| 2:41:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9707)|
| 2:41:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9710)|
| 2:41:51| I don't see any other hands raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9711)|
| 2:41:54| No other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9714)|
| 2:41:56| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9716)|

| 2:45:55| I see Miss quarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9955)|
| 2:45:57| Are you opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9957)|
| 2:46:01| Miss quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9961)|
| 2:46:05| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9965)|
| 2:46:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9967)|
| 2:46:07| And Kevin Murphy is also opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9967)|
| 2:46:11| Mr. Stanton, do you wish to go first or let the opposition go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9971)|
| 2:46:16| Opposition, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9976)|
| 2:46:18| Okay, we'll start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9978)|
| 2:46:26| I don't care which whichever one of you would like to go first, Kevin or Nadine, which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9986)|
| 2:46:31| which would you like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9991)|
| 2:46:33| Madam Chair, before we go, is there a staff report or commentary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=9993)|
| 2:46:41| Or do we do that after this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10001)|
| 2:46:44| Typically, we hear from the applicant and opposition, although if you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10004)|
| 2:46:53| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10013)|
| 2:46:54| I'll be happy to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10014)|
| 2:46:55| If I may share my screen now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10015)|
| 2:46:59| Who's sharing the screen right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10019)|
| 2:47:02| Okay, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10022)|
| 2:47:04| It's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10024)|
| 2:47:07| Okay, I think it should be sharing out now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10027)|
| 2:47:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10029)|
| 2:47:10| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10030)|
| 2:47:11| Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10031)|
| 2:47:13| It is not sharing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10033)|
| 2:47:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10037)|
| 2:47:20| Oh, I have to hit the share button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10040)|
| 2:47:22| That's very technical sharing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10042)|
| 2:47:26| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10046)|
| 2:47:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10046)|
| 2:47:27| Madam Chairman and commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10047)|
| 2:47:28| I'm Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10048)|
| 2:47:34| I'm speaking on behalf of Northeast Knox Planning Advocates, as well as Knox County Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10054)|
| 2:47:39| Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10059)|
| 2:47:40| We'd really like to thank you for a robust discussion that we had at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10060)|
| 2:47:45| You highlighted a number of concerns that KCPA and NACDA have with our planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10065)|
| 2:47:51| zone and our subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| After last month's meeting, we looked at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10073)|
| 2:47:57| We also looked at Woodbury Crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10077)|
| 2:47:58| We had a meeting with planning staff and engineering public work staff as well a couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10078)|
| 2:48:03| ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10083)|
| 2:48:04| We had a couple of county commissioners in there because we really want to take a holistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10084)|
| 2:48:07| look at what's going on in this area along Thompson School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10087)|
| 2:48:11| There's some opportunities to try and develop connectivity, neighborhoods, and community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10091)|
| 2:48:17| and we want to explore a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10097)|
| 2:48:20| I've sent that information to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10100)|
| 2:48:22| The background report, a meeting summary, as well as an excellent article that Compass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10102)|
| 2:48:28| Newsletter published, and I hope you've all had an opportunity to review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10108)|
| 2:48:32| We also want to thank Mr. Davis and the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10112)|
| 2:48:35| They've made a number of improvements with their plan design, so I think we've started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10115)|
| 2:48:42| to address a few of the things that were talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10122)|
| 2:48:45| We've, I'm not sure why my peers doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10125)|
| 2:48:49| We've moved the, it looks like the mail center has been moved to the front of the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10129)|
| 2:48:53| which should help with some traffic flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10133)|
| 2:48:55| They added some connectivity down to the Butler property, as well as the Davis property on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10135)|
| 2:49:03| the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10143)|
| 2:49:03| We've got some stub outs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10143)|
| 2:49:05| Those are actually just meeting kind of like what the minimum subdivision regulations say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10145)|
| 2:49:09| so it's good that we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10149)|
| 2:49:12| Mr. Davis also said he's committed to landscaping the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10152)|
| 2:49:15| And finally, in the back, we've got this larger, at least common park playground with at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10155)|
| 2:49:22| two playground accesses identified on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10162)|
| 2:49:25| So those are improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10165)|
| 2:49:27| Those are meaningful, and we appreciate those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10167)|
| 2:49:30| Also, I understand that county engineering has determined that this about 500-foot segment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10170)|
| 2:49:37| on the entrance should actually have a sidewalk on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10177)|
| 2:49:41| There'll be enough traffic and such that there are going to require sidewalk there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10181)|
| 2:49:46| so that's great to do connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10186)|
| 2:49:49| We would ask you maybe add a condition that this sidewalk, this is going to be 500 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10189)|
| 2:49:54| of about just a straight road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10194)|
| 2:49:56| Consider making those sidewalks have to be separated from the street by a grass buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10196)|
| 2:50:01| with trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10201)|
| 2:50:02| You can imagine at least a sidewalk where you can walk in the shade that make it a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10202)|
| 2:50:06| more useful for pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10206)|
| 2:50:08| We are, one thing that we just haven't resolved is we don't know how this common park gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10208)|
| 2:50:13| set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10213)|
| 2:50:15| Mr. Davis told us that he sells these lots to developers, the developers, to builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10215)|
| 2:50:21| The builders will then figure out what amenities they want to put on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10221)|
| 2:50:24| That kind of means that there's a hole that we could just have a common area here where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10224)|
| 2:50:29| nothing's ever actually put on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10229)|
| 2:50:31| So it could be helpful to add a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10231)|
| 2:50:34| They're requiring prior to the final plot approval that they submit a detailed plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10234)|
| 2:50:40| for improvements to the park that have to be implemented before the subdivision is 50%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10240)|
| 2:50:44| complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10244)|
| 2:50:45| That would actually ensure that this gets built out, which we've had a problem with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10245)|
| 2:50:49| in the Edwards Place subdivision across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10249)|
| 2:50:51| So this is helpful, but this plan still shows what's wrong with our planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10251)|
| 2:50:58| regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10258)|
| 2:51:00| This is in planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10260)|
| 2:51:02| It could easily have connectivity to some other subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10262)|
| 2:51:06| Our county isn't investing in sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10266)|
| 2:51:08| We asked about doing a sidewalks to connect four of these subdivisions, 2,000 feet, about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10268)|
| 2:51:12| $75,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10272)|
| 2:51:13| And we told it'd be a matter of five to 10 years before that sidewalk could be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10273)|
| 2:51:18| to connect hundreds of residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10278)|
| 2:51:20| So I'll wrap up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10280)|
| 2:51:24| We really do think that our regulations for planned residential and our subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10284)|
| 2:51:29| regulations really kind of have some pretty low standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10289)|
| 2:51:35| They kind of ask for things to be done aspirationally to make these unified development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10295)|
| 2:51:42| to provide for amenities, but they just don't require that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10302)|
| 2:51:46| And KCPA, we would love to work with planning commissioners to revisit these planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10306)|
| 2:51:52| regulation or planned residential ordinances as well as subdivision regulations and figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10312)|
| 2:51:58| out how can we really make it so that our development community builds development that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10318)|
| 2:52:04| actually builds community for us instead of what seems like we have a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10324)|
| 2:52:11| approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10331)|
| 2:52:12| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10332)|
| 2:52:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10334)|
| 2:52:16| Just before we go to you, Ms. Porter, Garrett Tucker, I see you've stopped and permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10336)|
| 2:52:22| Are you talking on behalf of the applicant or are you also in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10342)|
| 2:52:35| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10355)|
| 2:52:36| Yeah, I can hear you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10356)|
| 2:52:37| No, of course, we're the engineer working for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10357)|
| 2:52:42| And I wasn't sure at first if he was going to represent that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10362)|
| 2:52:47| And so I was about to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10367)|
| 2:52:49| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10369)|
| 2:52:50| Well, we'll hear from you after we've heard from the, finished hearing from opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10370)|
| 2:52:56| And Mr. Murphy, one thing that I did want to mention and just kind of make public here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10376)|
| 2:53:02| is that after our last meeting, the executive committee did meet and we have asked planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10382)|
| 2:53:10| staff to make it a work priority to review the planned residential ordinance and really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10390)|
| 2:53:22| take a look at some of the regulations on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10402)|
| 2:53:25| And you can expect that there will be some public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10405)|
| 2:53:28| And I know that they'll be interested to hear that planning staff will be, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10408)|
| 2:53:34| having public meetings and will be interested in the public feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10414)|
| 2:53:37| But we, as a commission, felt very hampered by not having in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10417)|
| 2:53:49| kind of things that we can look to and some standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10429)|
| 2:53:52| So that hopefully will be resolved for future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10432)|
| 2:53:59| Ms. Porter, we'll go to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10439)|
| 2:54:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10442)|
| 2:54:03| Nadine Porter, 7421 Oakland View Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10443)|
| 2:54:06| I'd like to defer the rest of my time to Kevin Murphy after the applicant has presented his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10446)|
| 2:54:14| deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10454)|
| 2:54:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10455)|
| 2:54:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10456)|
| 2:54:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10456)|
| 2:54:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10458)|
| 2:54:20| Applicant, Mr. Stanton, if you want to do the entire presentation or split your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10460)|
| 2:54:28| with Mr. Tucker, that's fine, but we'll start with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10468)|
| 2:54:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10473)|
| 2:54:34| First, I want to go ahead and start off by thanking Mr. Murphy, Mr. Thompson from last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10474)|
| 2:54:39| month, Ms. Porter, the rest of the Corrie Tent and Grids communities regarding their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10479)|
| 2:54:43| feedback on this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10483)|
| 2:54:44| And we also want this development to be an asset to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10484)|
| 2:54:49| I hope that we've exemplified that by following some of their requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10489)|
| 2:54:53| but on five or six separate items to progress and make this more of an asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10493)|
| 2:54:59| And so I believe everyone's relatively aware of these improvements since 30 days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10499)|
| 2:55:04| And so if anything, I just would like to say that we respect the request, the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10504)|
| 2:55:08| of staff's recommendation to approve the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10508)|
| 2:55:11| And I'm available for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10511)|
| 2:55:13| Appreciate everyone's time and service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10513)|
| 2:55:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10517)|
| 2:55:19| That was short and sweet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10519)|
| 2:55:21| We'll go to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10521)|
| 2:55:23| I'm assuming, Mr. Murphy, you didn't have anything to, I know Ms. Porter deferred her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10523)|
| 2:55:31| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10531)|
| 2:55:31| Assuming you're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10531)|
| 2:55:32| No, Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10532)|
| 2:55:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10533)|
| 2:55:34| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10534)|
| 2:55:36| We'll go to commission and we're going to start with Commissioner Covellet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10536)|
| 2:55:42| Yes, I have several questions for the applicant's representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10542)|
| 2:55:47| I wanted to start by asking you what the area is of the common areas and whether you consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10547)|
| 2:55:56| them to be buildable or not, other than the playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10556)|
| 2:56:05| Are any of those common areas considered buildable with the exception of the playground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10565)|
| 2:56:10| I believe is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10570)|
| 2:56:12| And that would be to you, Mr. Slayton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10572)|
| 2:56:17| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10577)|
| 2:56:19| We can hear you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10579)|
| 2:56:20| Good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10580)|
| 2:56:21| Well, given the size of the subdivision, there's several of those areas, as you can see, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10581)|
| 2:56:25| guess it'll be the southeast portion of the property by the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10585)|
| 2:56:28| Those will have to be mail centers that are kind of driven by USPS as to where exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10588)|
| 2:56:33| those will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10593)|
| 2:56:34| But as far as the other areas, the common area playground, we shortened our cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10594)|
| 2:56:40| to have a larger common area playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10600)|
| 2:56:42| So that you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10602)|
| 2:56:44| Ms. Korbelik has in, that portion is buildable and the others, I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10604)|
| 2:56:51| And Gary might have additional input on that, but I do not believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10611)|
| 2:56:55| And the sidewalk along the entranceway, I believe that was required by the county engineer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10615)|
| 2:57:02| As of recently, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10622)|
| 2:57:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10624)|
| 2:57:06| And so as far as amenities go, the applicant is only proposing an undeveloped common playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10626)|
| 2:57:19| outside of property that he couldn't use anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10639)|
| 2:57:25| So I'm confused here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10645)|
| 2:57:27| I'm actually just really confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10647)|
| 2:57:29| The PR requires that you meet certain standards in order to be considered planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10649)|
| 2:57:38| And I can't, I don't see unified architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10658)|
| 2:57:40| I don't, I don't see those standards being met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10660)|
| 2:57:45| And I believe the applicant responded in an inquiry that he didn't feel that planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10665)|
| 2:57:50| residential had to provide amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10670)|
| 2:57:53| And if that's the case, then we have to go only to the criteria in the code, which he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10673)|
| 2:58:00| has not justified how that is met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10680)|
| 2:58:04| I don't want to deny this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10684)|
| 2:58:08| I think he's caught in a transition area, I mean, a transition period of time where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10688)|
| 2:58:13| we're starting to really take a look at planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10693)|
| 2:58:17| But at the same time, I feel that there should be some amenities provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10697)|
| 2:58:25| And I'd like to point out just a few and get your reaction, if I may, sir, as to what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10705)|
| 2:58:32| think of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10712)|
| 2:58:34| May I take enough time to run through what those conditions might be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10714)|
| 2:58:38| I don't want to dominate the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10718)|
| 2:58:40| Chairman, Madam Chair, should I, may I go ahead and proceed with an outline of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10720)|
| 2:58:46| amenities that I might?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10726)|
| 2:58:49| You are a commissioner and you have every right to voice your opinion and add to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10729)|
| 2:58:55| discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10735)|
| 2:58:56| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10736)|
| 2:58:57| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10737)|
| 2:58:58| Well, just in quick summary, and then when we get to the motion part, I can talk more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10738)|
| 2:59:05| slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10745)|
| 2:59:06| I would like to see the entrance sidewalks have a planted and irrigated street buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10746)|
| 2:59:13| I like it planted with bushes and canopy trees that reach a mature height of at least 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10753)|
| 2:59:18| feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10758)|
| 2:59:20| And I don't know what the width of that median should be, but we can talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10760)|
| 2:59:25| That's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10765)|
| 2:59:26| Number two, I'd like to see the new homeowners association provided with a, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10766)|
| 2:59:34| with a sum of $37,800, which is received by the time the homeowners association has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10774)|
| 2:59:43| been established for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10783)|
| 2:59:46| And the way I calculated this amount is an odd amount, but I multiplied 189 by $200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10786)|
| 2:59:54| I figured that the applicant wouldn't be too impacted if he donated $200 a lot toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10794)|
| 3:00:04| the homeowners association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10804)|
| 3:00:07| I would like to see the common areas be graded to the point where they're usable, planted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10807)|
| 3:00:13| in grass, and that a water faucet is provided in each common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10813)|
| 3:00:19| My hope is that they might be used in for pocket parks or community gardens, but you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10819)|
| 3:00:26| going to need water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10826)|
| 3:00:28| I would like to see a 15 foot wide pedestrian easement located between lots 12 and 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10828)|
| 3:00:36| Can you move the plat up to the upper right hand corner so we can look at the relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10836)|
| 3:00:42| of those two lots to the lower corner of the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10842)|
| 3:00:50| Need to go up, not down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10850)|
| 3:00:52| I mean, I want to see down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10852)|
| 3:00:54| You're going the wrong direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10854)|
| 3:00:56| Between 12 and 13, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10856)|
| 3:00:58| Okay, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10858)|
| 3:00:59| There, stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10859)|
| 3:01:01| Go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10861)|
| 3:01:03| You're not getting me to 12, 13 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10863)|
| 3:01:08| Okay, you can see that that's a drainage easement right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10868)|
| 3:01:12| And when I questioned about making the drainage easements into pedestrian easements, it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10872)|
| 3:01:19| let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10879)|
| 3:01:21| Yeah, it was, I was told that the homes were too close together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10881)|
| 3:01:26| But if you look at 12 and 13, I think you could space them apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10886)|
| 3:01:31| And is that a 25 foot drainage easement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10891)|
| 3:01:35| But anyway, if we had 15 feet of pedestrian access, at some point, we could run that through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10895)|
| 3:01:42| the detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10902)|
| 3:01:44| And hopefully, if you go up a little more, there might be a future connection to these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10904)|
| 3:01:49| roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10909)|
| 3:01:51| So I would like to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10911)|
| 3:01:53| And I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10913)|
| 3:01:56| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10916)|
| 3:01:58| And that we take up the applicant's offer to save mature trees whenever he can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10918)|
| 3:02:05| I feel that those at least provide some amenities that allow people to congregate and socialize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10925)|
| 3:02:13| That because the lots are small, they allow them to get some community gardening in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10933)|
| 3:02:18| And it gives the HOA some seed money so they can start looking at improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10938)|
| 3:02:23| Now, we all know that $337,800 is pocket change when it comes to playground equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10943)|
| 3:02:31| But it's a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10951)|
| 3:02:32| And I think we need to have somebody help the HOA get a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10952)|
| 3:02:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10958)|
| 3:02:39| Mr. Green, could you address some of Commissioner Corbello's questions or concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10959)|
| 3:02:46| She could certainly pose those as conditions to the other commissioners that she wishes to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10966)|
| 3:02:51| Some, I have some concern that these, I'm not sure what the basis of making those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10971)|
| 3:03:00| recommended conditions are other than her desire to have input on the subdivision design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10980)|
| 3:03:10| Thank you, Commissioner Corbello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10990)|
| 3:03:12| We're going to move on to Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10992)|
| 3:03:17| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=10997)|
| 3:03:25| I mean, $37,000, if somebody told me I had to spend $37,000 in my company to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11005)|
| 3:03:33| that'd be a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11013)|
| 3:03:35| Not sure we can do that and require that of a developer, but be that as it may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11015)|
| 3:03:43| I think what we, I think we postponed this item last month in order to move, in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11023)|
| 3:03:50| get some concessions and get a better concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11030)|
| 3:03:53| And I think we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11033)|
| 3:03:55| I think that the developer has conceded some things and put some things in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11035)|
| 3:04:04| And again, I would love, I mean, we've got to decide whether this is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11044)|
| 3:04:12| a unaffordable utopia or we're going to have affordable housing in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11052)|
| 3:04:17| And after I'm gone, everybody can make that decision for themselves and we can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11057)|
| 3:04:24| decide what we're going to do from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11064)|
| 3:04:26| But I just, I think our job with land use should be more broad strokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11066)|
| 3:04:36| And Sandra, I'm not discounting anything you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11076)|
| 3:04:39| All those are great ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11079)|
| 3:04:40| I really think they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11080)|
| 3:04:41| But I think those are more things that if the people in a homeowners association decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11081)|
| 3:04:47| they want those things, I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11087)|
| 3:04:50| But in developments like this, where you're trying to get affordable housing, most of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11090)|
| 3:04:56| those people don't have $500 a year for an HOA dues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11096)|
| 3:05:00| I mean, they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11100)|
| 3:05:01| They are trying to buy as much house as they can and they're budgeting for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11101)|
| 3:05:07| So I think we need to be more concerned with broad strokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11107)|
| 3:05:12| I think all those are great ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11112)|
| 3:05:14| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11114)|
| 3:05:15| I think that shows a lot of forethought and a lot of time put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11115)|
| 3:05:19| But I think we need to be a little bit more consistent with just the land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11119)|
| 3:05:25| I know this is a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11125)|
| 3:05:27| I know this is how it's going to get built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11127)|
| 3:05:29| But I think we've got the developer based on the emails I've gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11129)|
| 3:05:35| The developer has stayed in contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11135)|
| 3:05:38| He's done what we like to see happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11138)|
| 3:05:41| Neighborhoods and neighborhood representatives and developers have dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11141)|
| 3:05:48| See if we can come to some kind of common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11148)|
| 3:05:53| That being said, I'd like to make a motion that we approve variances one through three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11153)|
| 3:05:57| because the topographic constraints and site conditions restrict compliance with subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11157)|
| 3:06:04| regulations and will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11164)|
| 3:06:07| I have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Ruff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11167)|
| 3:06:12| We still do have some commissioners with their hands up going with Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11172)|
| 3:06:20| Okay, just a couple of things real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11180)|
| 3:06:23| You know, I know we're going to revisit and we're going to work through this PR zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11183)|
| 3:06:27| But as you read through the PR zoning, it doesn't specifically require playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11187)|
| 3:06:34| things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11194)|
| 3:06:34| I'm not saying that that's bad or, I mean, it does, it should or shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11194)|
| 3:06:39| I'm just saying in this case, it really doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11199)|
| 3:06:41| It says open space for recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11201)|
| 3:06:45| It doesn't say anything about amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11205)|
| 3:06:47| So, I mean, again, we can look at that and make it more stringent if that's the will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11207)|
| 3:06:56| of everybody, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11216)|
| 3:06:57| But for right now, I don't think that we can force that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11217)|
| 3:07:01| You know, on some of those neat ideas, they're good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11221)|
| 3:07:04| But remember, every water faucet will have to have a water meter and they will have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11224)|
| 3:07:09| monthly bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11229)|
| 3:07:10| And the irrigation along the trees in the right-of-way, I don't know how that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11230)|
| 3:07:15| work, but we'll have a bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11235)|
| 3:07:18| The walking trails on the drainage easements, I mean, is that homeowner going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11238)|
| 3:07:24| carry insurance for liability for people walking on his land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11244)|
| 3:07:28| Or is that going to be a separately parcel piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11248)|
| 3:07:33| You know, we also, you know, we can set aside some land for parks and the developer might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11253)|
| 3:07:40| sell it to the HOA and be reimbursed over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11260)|
| 3:07:43| But, I mean, all these things we can do, but it's the cost of that will get passed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11263)|
| 3:07:49| And it's just a matter of, are we going to force people to pay for things we think they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11269)|
| 3:07:57| should want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11277)|
| 3:07:58| I think that's the best way to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11278)|
| 3:08:01| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11281)|
| 3:08:03| Commissioner Dent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11283)|
| 3:08:05| Yes, I think that this case has been caught in the middle of a larger discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11285)|
| 3:08:12| And a lot of commissioners have pointed out the fact that there's not verbiage yet written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11292)|
| 3:08:17| to hold developers to some of these conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11297)|
| 3:08:21| And so it is worth the full discussion if Planned Residential is going to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11301)|
| 3:08:27| But at this moment, they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11307)|
| 3:08:29| I think with the open space verbiage that Commissioner Smith brought up, a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11309)|
| 3:08:35| could be added that those common areas be graded in grass, because there's no saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11315)|
| 3:08:40| whether it would be usable space without that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11320)|
| 3:08:43| I could see that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11323)|
| 3:08:45| I could see the condition of mature trees being kept when possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11325)|
| 3:08:48| That would allow the neighborhood to feel a little bit more organic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11328)|
| 3:08:52| But I think past that, this developer has taken some consideration of what we said last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11332)|
| 3:08:57| month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11337)|
| 3:08:59| And we need to develop it further, because it's vague enough and open enough that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11339)|
| 3:09:04| can't necessarily hold him to these bigger things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11344)|
| 3:09:09| There's also the problem of the fact that the conditions we set, there's no place where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11349)|
| 3:09:16| it's enforced later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11356)|
| 3:09:17| So I think that's part of a larger discussion at another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11357)|
| 3:09:21| But for now, I think that we go ahead and get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11361)|
| 3:09:26| Move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11366)|
| 3:09:30| Mr. Murphy and Ms. Porter, I do see your hands up, but this is now going to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11370)|
| 3:09:39| I know you also had 25 seconds left on your time, but I'd really kind of like this to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11379)|
| 3:09:49| continue on with commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11389)|
| 3:09:50| And with that being said, we're going to go to Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11390)|
| 3:09:58| I'm glad that we're having this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11398)|
| 3:10:00| Do you think we need to look at the planned residential zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11400)|
| 3:10:04| I'm really pleased that that's the result the executive committee has brought to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11404)|
| 3:10:10| I think the plan is better than what we saw last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11410)|
| 3:10:14| It's not great, but it's definitely better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11414)|
| 3:10:16| And I'm happy with open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11416)|
| 3:10:18| I think open space can be as useful or even more useful than a playground in some cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11418)|
| 3:10:27| And just a couple of thoughts about the landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11427)|
| 3:10:32| Yes, if there are any trees that can be kept in those open spaces, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11432)|
| 3:10:36| If the landscaping gets introduced to the native plants and trees, they won't require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11436)|
| 3:10:42| once they're established, they won't necessarily require additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11442)|
| 3:10:46| irrigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11446)|
| 3:10:47| So that would be a helpful thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11447)|
| 3:10:49| But I think this is better than what we saw last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11449)|
| 3:10:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11453)|
| 3:10:54| Commissioner Clancy, you have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11454)|
| 3:10:57| Is that just so you can continue on with the motions, or did you have something else to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11457)|
| 3:11:02| Just so I can continue with the motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11462)|
| 3:11:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11465)|
| 3:11:05| Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11465)|
| 3:11:07| Yes, I guess what I don't understand is, are two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11467)|
| 3:11:14| One is the assumption that this is affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11474)|
| 3:11:19| We don't even know what houses will sell for, since the developer only sells the lots to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11479)|
| 3:11:26| various builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11486)|
| 3:11:28| We can assume they're not going to be expensive, but we don't actually know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11488)|
| 3:11:32| And if we don't proceed with something that makes the PR stand out, then why does he get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11492)|
| 3:11:41| PR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11501)|
| 3:11:41| I don't understand how he meets the PR criteria specifically, and maybe he should just go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11501)|
| 3:11:48| back to a regular subdivision with larger lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11508)|
| 3:11:52| The PR planned residential has already been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11512)|
| 3:11:58| That is something that is not at this stage of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11518)|
| 3:12:06| That's already been approved, and what we're approving is the plan, the concept in use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11526)|
| 3:12:14| on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11534)|
| 3:12:16| And so, if you are not in favor of approving this, you have a vote, but at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11536)|
| 3:12:24| we are not, the planned residential has already been approved, and I think that we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11544)|
| 3:12:29| to go ahead and move on with the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11549)|
| 3:12:33| We do have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Roth to approve variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11553)|
| 3:12:38| one through three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11558)|
| 3:12:39| This is why it's called the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11559)|
| 3:12:47| Yes, we're going to call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11567)|
| 3:12:48| Commissioner Boyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11568)|
| 3:12:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11570)|
| 3:12:51| Commissioner Browning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11571)|
| 3:12:54| Commissioner Browning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11574)|
| 3:12:56| I'm mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11576)|
| 3:12:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11576)|
| 3:12:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11577)|
| 3:12:58| Commissioner Buston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11578)|
| 3:12:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11579)|
| 3:13:00| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11580)|
| 3:13:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11582)|
| 3:13:03| Commissioner Dent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11583)|
| 3:13:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11585)|
| 3:13:05| Commissioner Eason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11585)|
| 3:13:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11587)|
| 3:13:08| Commissioner Graff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11588)|

| 3:13:26| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11606)|
| 3:13:28| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11608)|
| 3:13:29| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the alternate design standards one through three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11609)|
| 3:13:35| based on the recommendations of the Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11615)|
| 3:13:42| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy and I'm going to go with Commissioner Roth because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11622)|
| 3:13:45| your voice was a little bit louder than the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11625)|
| 3:13:50| Commissioner Dent, you had your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11630)|
| 3:13:53| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11633)|
| 3:13:53| I just wanted to make a comment and then we can continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11633)|
| 3:13:57| I think that we might want to explore the term affordable housing a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11637)|
| 3:14:02| so that we're not calling everything affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11642)|
| 3:14:07| And I understand Commissioner Korbelik about the fact that planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11647)|
| 3:14:15| requests more from a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11655)|
| 3:14:17| And I think that that's where those conversations going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11657)|
| 3:14:21| we'll try to clear that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11661)|
| 3:14:22| Because you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11662)|
| 3:14:23| If we're going to call something like this planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11663)|
| 3:14:26| it might need to have a little bit more thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11666)|
| 3:14:28| But it's just there's not vocabulary for it at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11668)|
| 3:14:31| I just wanted to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11671)|
| 3:14:35| And Mr. Green, correct me if I'm wrong, but we can't, as far as planning commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11675)|
| 3:14:45| we shouldn't even really actually be using the term affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11685)|
| 3:14:50| when it comes to concept plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11690)|
| 3:14:52| Is that accurate or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11692)|
| 3:14:55| We can't base decisions on the cost of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11695)|
| 3:14:59| That's a violation of fair housing laws and other state statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11699)|
| 3:15:06| We cannot, even through zoning, it's difficult to address incentives for affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11706)|
| 3:15:15| or other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11715)|
| 3:15:16| And the definition of affordable housing is challenging also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11716)|
| 3:15:20| So I think we can certainly provide information and have our community development directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11720)|
| 3:15:27| both the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11727)|
| 3:15:28| Now the city is neighborhood and community, neighborhood housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11728)|
| 3:15:33| I forgot what the name is, but have them talk about housing in the city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11733)|
| 3:15:39| and provide information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11739)|
| 3:15:41| And we'll do that at one of your future training sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11741)|
| 3:15:44| But I was going to suggest affordable housing, it's not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11744)|
| 3:15:48| And also, on a roll here, we do not, the planning commission does not have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11748)|
| 3:15:54| approve the alternate design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11754)|
| 3:15:57| That's an engineer and public works approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11757)|
| 3:16:01| The planning commission is not involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11761)|
| 3:16:03| That's just for your information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11763)|
| 3:16:04| So Commissioner Clancy can go on to the concept plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11764)|
| 3:16:11| So this one staff recommendation about approving the alternate design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11771)|
| 3:16:15| I thought that that was part of, it is part of the subdivision variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11775)|
| 3:16:24| There was an alternative design standards requiring planning commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11784)|
| 3:16:29| And then there was two that were public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11789)|
| 3:16:34| Okay, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11794)|
| 3:16:36| Okay, so we're going to continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11796)|
| 3:16:38| We've got a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Roth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11798)|
| 3:16:42| to approve the alternate design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=11802)|

| 3:22:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12146)|

| 3:22:42| This matter is a complicated matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12162)|
| 3:22:43| I sent in a request for a 60-day postponement on Tuesday following the agenda review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12163)|

| 3:23:02| After those concerns were raised, I discussed it with my client and the goal is to seek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12182)|
| 3:23:11| a postponement in hopes of trying to address or see if we can alleviate some of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12191)|

| 3:24:24| areas to be built, sidewalks to be installed, connections to the schools to be made, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12264)|

| 3:24:34| residents have faced since purchasing our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12274)|
| 3:24:38| We've been working with Knox County on having our deplorable street conditions repaired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12278)|
| 3:24:42| in addition to waiting for Halstead Powell to perform a permanent repair for the inadequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12282)|

| 3:24:53| Our narrow streets are lined with vehicles on both sides, often requiring vehicles to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12293)|
| 3:24:58| take turns passing through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12298)|
| 3:25:00| None of us residents can even figure out what is going on with our HOA if there even is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12300)|
| 3:25:05| one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12305)|
| 3:25:06| And now after all of this, we are being asked to accept a different neighborhood than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12306)|
| 3:25:11| was first presented to us by developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12311)|
| 3:25:14| As working middle-class families, our homes are our biggest asset, which we based our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12314)|
| 3:25:20| investment decision on a neighborhood that was supposed to be single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12320)|
| 3:25:24| We respectfully ask you to keep that commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12324)|
| 3:25:29| Horton is a beautiful rural community with no apartment complexes to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12329)|
| 3:25:34| It was not even remotely on my radar that huge three-story apartments would be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12334)|
| 3:25:38| within 100 feet of our backyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12338)|
| 3:25:42| My family and I have lived in our home for only a year and a half, as have most of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12342)|
| 3:25:46| residents on Forest Willow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12346)|
| 3:25:48| However, my realtor is on standby, waiting to put our house up for sale if this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12348)|
| 3:25:53| is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12353)|
| 3:25:54| I don't want to move, but feel we have no choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12354)|
| 3:25:57| Despite that, moving again so soon will create a financial hardship in addition to the depreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12357)|
| 3:26:04| of our home value if the apartments are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12364)|
| 3:26:07| Several neighbors have expressed to me that they will sell their home too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12367)|
| 3:26:11| In fact, four or five homes have already been listed for sale in Edwards Place since this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12371)|
| 3:26:16| proposal was announced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12376)|
| 3:26:19| But some neighbors have expressed they will not be fortunate enough to sell, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12379)|
| 3:26:23| will be stuck with this mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12383)|
| 3:26:26| We envisioned a neighborhood of single-family homes where our children could grow up together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12386)|
| 3:26:32| playing in our backyards, where they could safely ride their bikes, where we could take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12392)|
| 3:26:36| family walks down sidewalks, and where we could have that neighborly connection for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12396)|
| 3:26:41| years to come with the homeowners around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12401)|
| 3:26:44| Everyone wants to be proud of where they live, and these apartments would take that away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12404)|
| 3:26:48| from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12408)|
| 3:26:50| When the first buyers bought their homes here in Edwards Place, they were promised a pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12410)|
| 3:26:54| clubhouse, common area, and walking trails of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12414)|
| 3:26:59| The developers let us down, and we hope you won't let us down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12419)|
| 3:27:03| On behalf of my neighbors and the hundreds of Corryton residents who have emailed you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12423)|
| 3:27:08| I am requesting that you deny the proposal and do not postpone it for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12428)|
| 3:27:12| Many residents have already lost sleep, and some have dealt with the physical effects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12432)|
| 3:27:17| of stress over these past two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12437)|
| 3:27:20| Stretching this out two more months would be devastating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12440)|
| 3:27:24| Any proposal needs to have a build-out of single-family homes for all of the remaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12444)|

| 3:27:35| complete the amenities that have been promised for 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12455)|

| 3:27:58| Commissioners, this proposal, this concept plan in front of you, it's got a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12478)|
| 3:28:02| issues that Misty just summarized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12482)|
| 3:28:04| The only reason to actually grant a postponement is if the applicant today can tell you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12484)|
| 3:28:08| they've been approached that will address access to the, or that they're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12488)|
| 3:28:11| able to address access to the apartments, preferably a separate street connection that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12491)|
| 3:28:15| doesn't connect the apartments to the housing development, a plan that shows you what they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12495)|
| 3:28:19| doing with the rest of the property, how they're going to finish the use-on-review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12499)|
| 3:28:23| condition to establish an HOA, establishing the common area that was required by the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12503)|
| 3:28:27| use-on-review, and doing connectivity to the schools and landscape screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12507)|
| 3:28:32| And then even if they can, if they're going to tell you today they can do all that, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12512)|
| 3:28:36| still have to grapple with the question of, is this fair to the residents who bought into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12516)|
| 3:28:40| a subdivision that was going to be single-family residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12520)|
| 3:28:43| So if you vote to postpone it, realize you'll drag it on even longer for residents who've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12523)|
| 3:28:47| already endured a lot, and you'll have to trust the applicant to just drastically expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12527)|
| 3:28:54| their proposal to address all these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12534)|
| 3:28:56| So I respectfully ask you to vote to deny this today, and tell the applicant that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12536)|
| 3:29:01| isn't the kind of proposal that will work here, and that you need to come back with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12541)|
| 3:29:05| a different proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12545)|
| 3:29:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12546)|
| 3:29:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12546)|
| 3:29:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12547)|
| 3:29:09| We're going to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12549)|
| 3:29:11| Commissioner Clancy, you have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12551)|
| 3:29:13| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12553)|
| 3:29:16| First of all, I'd like to say, Ms. Richards, it's horrible that you all have been stuck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12556)|
| 3:29:24| with inadequate development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12564)|
| 3:29:26| I think it's, I've seen the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12566)|
| 3:29:28| I think, I really feel for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12568)|
| 3:29:33| My biggest problem with this is not that it's apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12573)|
| 3:29:36| I think apartments have their place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12576)|
| 3:29:39| Maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12579)|
| 3:29:39| I think apartments have their place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12579)|
| 3:29:41| Maybe not behind this subdivision, and certainly not through this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12581)|
| 3:29:47| Finding a separate access would help a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12587)|
| 3:29:52| And as much as you want this denied, I think 60 days, giving 60 days to the applicant would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12592)|
| 3:30:03| help them come back with something better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12603)|
| 3:30:06| Granted, I won't have to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12606)|
| 3:30:07| But I think 60 days to get with the neighborhoods and say, what is a good use of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12607)|
| 3:30:15| I don't know why you all would have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12615)|
| 3:30:20| inkling to even negotiate with the developer at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12620)|
| 3:30:23| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12623)|
| 3:30:24| But my gut is telling me that a 60-day postponement would probably do a lot of good for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12624)|
| 3:30:32| So I'm going to make a motion that we postpone for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12632)|
| 3:30:35| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12635)|
| 3:30:38| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12638)|
| 3:30:43| Commissioner Kovelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12643)|
| 3:30:46| And I have a question that I'd like to direct to Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12646)|
| 3:30:50| If an application is denied, is there a time period by which it has to wait before it can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12650)|
| 3:30:58| come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12658)|
| 3:31:00| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12660)|
| 3:31:08| I had to unmute myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12668)|
| 3:31:09| Sorry for the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12669)|
| 3:31:13| Actually, I'm unclear on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12673)|
| 3:31:14| I know a rezoning request, a member request, there's a year delay on a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12674)|
| 3:31:24| I'm unclear, to be quite honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12684)|
| 3:31:26| That's a question I've never pondered before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12686)|
| 3:31:30| My inclination is they could address the reasons for denial and submit a revised plan as soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12690)|
| 3:31:39| as they have revised that plan to address the reasons for denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12699)|
| 3:31:45| So if there were a denial, you would have to be clearly specific as to the reasons for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12705)|
| 3:31:52| the denial for the applicant to be able to respond to it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12712)|
| 3:31:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12716)|
| 3:31:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12717)|
| 3:31:58| Okay, that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12718)|
| 3:31:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12719)|
| 3:32:02| Commissioner Eason next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12722)|
| 3:32:08| I have a question for the applicant in response to the opposition's list of items to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12728)|
| 3:32:14| I'd like to know if those are things that during this, if we do postpone it, if during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12734)|
| 3:32:19| this postponed period, those are items that they will be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12739)|
| 3:32:23| Yes, I think me being able to keep up with the entire list that was listed, I cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12743)|
| 3:32:32| recall those offhand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12752)|
| 3:32:33| Again, my involvement in this is really new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12753)|
| 3:32:36| We have an out-of-town developer, which the principal thing that seemed really a crux| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12756)|
| 3:32:44| on Tuesday was the access issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12764)|
| 3:32:46| So I can say that our initial step right now is to proceed with looking for alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12766)|
| 3:32:52| access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12772)|
| 3:32:54| I think that may help alleviate, from what I could gather, the principal concern on Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12774)|
| 3:33:00| and through a lot of the comments and objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12780)|
| 3:33:03| I would point out that even with this proposed development, if you recall from the objections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12783)|
| 3:33:09| and the challenges to it, there's some, there's an issue with the sewer drainage issue and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12789)|
| 3:33:16| the developer is proposing to come in and install an industrial system, you know, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12796)|
| 3:33:21| part of improving that for the residential development, you know, to work alongside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12801)|
| 3:33:28| and coexist with the proposed apartment development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12808)|
| 3:33:32| There are, you know, there's green spaces, there are sidewalks or sidewalk easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12812)|
| 3:33:37| that are proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12817)|
| 3:33:38| I know those are some of the things Mr. Murphy raised, but it's not simply a 60-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12818)|
| 3:33:43| postponement to sit on our hands and see, you know, what can come up or what can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12823)|
| 3:33:49| It's actively looking to alleviate the concerns and issues raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12829)|
| 3:33:55| And the question about what would happen with the rest of the property is the rest of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12835)|
| 3:33:58| property that's not part of the apartment complex development, is it proposed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12838)|
| 3:34:03| left undeveloped in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12843)|
| 3:34:07| Of this tract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12847)|
| 3:34:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12849)|
| 3:34:11| I don't know that information at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12851)|
| 3:34:13| That seemed to be kind of my, you know, from what I could understand to this point, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12853)|
| 3:34:19| I cannot confirm or deny exactly what that was proposed to be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12859)|
| 3:34:27| Again, you know, it's for an 80-unit apartment complex and I don't know how this may, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12867)|
| 3:34:33| know, shift or alter if we're looking for an alternative access and we get an alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12873)|
| 3:34:37| access, how does that impact or affect the current layout?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12877)|
| 3:34:41| I think that will obviously change a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12881)|
| 3:34:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12885)|
| 3:34:48| Commissioner Weston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12888)|
| 3:34:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12892)|
| 3:34:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12892)|
| 3:34:54| Mr. Forrester, you said that you guys were looking at a different access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12894)|
| 3:35:02| So, what is your plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12902)|
| 3:35:04| Where have you guys put any thought process into that in the last two days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12904)|
| 3:35:10| Where you would try to put your access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12910)|
| 3:35:15| Well, presumably, I'm assuming it would be between the parcels between Thompson School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12915)|
| 3:35:22| Road or potentially there's some research to be done into Twin Oak Lane as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12922)|
| 3:35:31| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12931)|
| 3:35:35| Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12935)|
| 3:35:36| Mr. Forrester, would the access also include pedestrian access to the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12936)|
| 3:35:45| I know right now we have the proposed sidewalk easement and the previous concept plan or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12945)|
| 3:35:51| use some review plan was for, you know, the sidewalks to be built out at Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12951)|
| 3:35:59| And so, you would intend to continue with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12959)|
| 3:36:03| That's why we would have, yes, the easements, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12963)|
| 3:36:06| No, the improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12966)|
| 3:36:08| The improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12968)|
| 3:36:10| Which actually improves the walkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12970)|
| 3:36:13| I don't believe there ever was a requirement or suggestion that the developer construct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12973)|
| 3:36:18| those sidewalks to connect to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12978)|
| 3:36:21| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12981)|
| 3:36:24| And Commissioner Dick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12984)|
| 3:36:28| I think that some of the concerns of the opposition is also how close the apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12988)|
| 3:36:34| buildings are to the backside of this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12994)|
| 3:36:38| I don't want to assume anything, but I can't imagine that this big of a parcel of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=12998)|
| 3:36:43| would be purchased for just two apartment buildings with nothing else phased for future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13003)|
| 3:36:50| development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13010)|
| 3:36:50| So, there is a strong possibility that this is phase one of many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13010)|
| 3:36:57| My question for Mr. Forrester would be that if a second access or an alternative access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13017)|
| 3:37:03| was considered, would there still be a connection into Edwards Place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13023)|
| 3:37:10| I don't have that information at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13030)|
| 3:37:11| I think based on the concerns that were raised at NPC Agenda Review meeting, that the access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13031)|
| 3:37:19| through Edwards Place did not seem to be a viable or preferred access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13039)|
| 3:37:24| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13044)|
| 3:37:33| Is there a motion on the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13053)|
| 3:37:38| There is a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Graf to postpone for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13058)|
| 3:37:45| 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13065)|
| 3:37:46| Could I call for the vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13066)|
| 3:37:49| In just one moment, because I had a question that I'm trying to remember what my question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13069)|
| 3:37:56| was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13076)|
| 3:38:03| Since I can't remember what my, oh, I do know what my question was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13083)|
| 3:38:08| I would like to ask County Engineering with regards to the sewer that has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13088)|
| 3:38:17| dysfunctional since 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13097)|
| 3:38:21| Are these public streets, Edwards Place, is that public streets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13101)|
| 3:38:25| And why has the sewer not been, has, why has it been in disrepair since 2018?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13105)|
| 3:38:34| They are, they are public streets and the sewers are out of our purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13114)|
| 3:38:39| That would be Allsdale Power Utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13119)|
| 3:38:44| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13124)|
| 3:38:47| So, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13127)|
| 3:38:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13129)|
| 3:38:50| Steve Elliott, 205 West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13130)|
| 3:38:53| I did speak with Allsdale Power and the initial, the original developer here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13133)|
| 3:38:59| didn't complete the sewer as it was required by Allsdale Power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13139)|
| 3:39:03| So, they have put a temporary fix in and the apartments will be required to upgrade the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13143)|
| 3:39:09| system to accommodate all the units within Edwards Place as part of the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13149)|
| 3:39:15| If the development is approved, they'll have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13155)|
| 3:39:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13158)|
| 3:39:20| So, it, the developer that did Edwards Place then is no longer in the picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13160)|
| 3:39:26| or is that the same developer that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13166)|
| 3:39:30| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13170)|
| 3:39:31| The bank, the bank foreclosed the development from the original developer and the banks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13171)|
| 3:39:36| then sold to D.R. Horton who built the homes and connected to the sewer system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13176)|
| 3:39:41| not realizing that it was never completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13181)|
| 3:39:44| I see that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13184)|
| 3:39:45| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13185)|
| 3:39:46| We do have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Graf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13186)|
| 3:39:50| to postpone this item for 60 days, which would also, just to clarify Commissioner Clancy that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13190)|
| 3:40:02| this would, this postponement that you are, is part of your motion of postponement to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13202)|
| 3:40:09| incorporate all four motions, all four votes that we would need to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13209)|
| 3:40:14| I just want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13214)|
| 3:40:15| Yes it is, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13215)|
| 3:40:16| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13216)|

| 3:40:40| Yes, but I also want to note that when this application returns, I'd like some information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13240)|
| 3:40:47| on whether Edwards Place was supposed to have sidewalks and if the bond includes that provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13247)|
| 3:40:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13253)|

| 3:41:03| Unanimous approval on agenda item number 16 to postpone for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13263)|
| 3:41:09| And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13269)|
| 3:41:12| No, I don't apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13272)|
| 3:41:13| I'm sorry for the community that there is an additional lag, but hopefully there will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13273)|
| 3:41:22| be some positive results from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13282)|
| 3:41:24| As Mr. Forster said, they're not going to just sit back for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13284)|
| 3:41:28| Hopefully they'll be working with the community to make some improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13288)|
| 3:41:35| That being said, we are going on to agenda item number 17, and I'm scrolling to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13295)|
| 3:41:45| Okay, this is a subdivision report concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13305)|
| 3:41:49| The subdivision is Cherokee Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13309)|
| 3:41:52| The applicant or developer is Cherokee Landing Development, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13312)|
| 3:42:01| Location is south of West Governor John Sevier Highway, east of Cotney Road, south of Graybrook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13321)|
| 3:42:11| Lane, north of Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13331)|
| 3:42:15| The approximate acreage is 25.59 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13335)|
| 3:42:19| The zoning is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13339)|
| 3:42:24| The existing land use is residences and vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13344)|
| 3:42:28| The proposed use is removal of a sidewalk requirement, a condition of the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13348)|
| 3:42:38| approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13358)|
| 3:42:40| There is no lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13360)|
| 3:42:41| There are no subdivision variances requested or required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13361)|
| 3:42:47| And the staff recommendation is to approve the applicant's request to remove the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13367)|
| 3:42:52| condition, condition number three of the concept plan approval of January 12, 2017, and replace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13372)|
| 3:43:01| it with the following condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13381)|
| 3:43:05| Before we go, and just because we want to give you as much opportunity to talk as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13385)|
| 3:43:12| Mr. Breschko, could you just give us a little bit of background on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13392)|
| 3:43:16| Madam Chair, Madam Chair, can I make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13396)|
| 3:43:23| Didn't we postpone this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13403)|
| 3:43:25| Wasn't this requested to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13405)|
| 3:43:28| It was requested to be postponed, but then it was also requested to be taken off postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13408)|
| 3:43:35| Okay, I'm sorry, I didn't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13415)|
| 3:43:38| Yes, and all the items that had been requested to be postponed, the community, there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13418)|
| 3:43:45| requests to take them off postponement, so we're hearing them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13425)|
| 3:43:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13430)|
| 3:43:53| Mr. Breschko, could you just give us a little bit of a background?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13433)|
| 3:43:56| Yeah, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13436)|
| 3:43:58| Chair, members of the Commission, when this subdivision was originally approved, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13438)|
| 3:44:03| was a condition that they installed the sidewalks that were shown on the original concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13443)|
| 3:44:11| And the plan that's before you right now, you can see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13451)|
| 3:44:16| sidewalks are highlighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13456)|
| 3:44:17| They're on one side of all the internal streets, and there is actually a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13457)|
| 3:44:23| that was required along the frontage on Coatney Road, the entire frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13463)|
| 3:44:29| The subdivision at this point in time, a little over half of it has been platted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13469)|
| 3:44:35| A number of homes have been built still, and there's a number under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13475)|
| 3:44:40| And the applicant has requested that the sidewalk requirement be removed on the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13480)|
| 3:44:47| We had discussed this with Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13487)|
| 3:44:51| Their recommendation, and I think they can respond more on that issue during the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13491)|
| 3:44:57| but was that they found the removal of that condition on the internal sidewalks was acceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13497)|
| 3:45:04| but were still requiring that the sidewalk along Coatney Road be put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13504)|
| 3:45:10| The property on the southern end on Coatney is approximately 600 feet from the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13510)|
| 3:45:16| with Tipton Station Road that actually has sidewalks along Tipton Station that take you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13516)|
| 3:45:21| to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13521)|
| 3:45:24| The property does back up to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13524)|
| 3:45:29| When we went through the original subdivision, we had discussion with the school board at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13529)|
| 3:45:34| that time concerning connection of the property, internal subdivision to the school property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13534)|
| 3:45:42| But at that time, the position had been that they didn't want that internal connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13542)|
| 3:45:48| I mean, it basically takes, would bring people out into the field behind the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13548)|
| 3:45:54| and I think the issue was more on security concerns for access into the school property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13554)|
| 3:45:59| So that is not a part of the original approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13559)|
| 3:46:02| There is a common area that adjoins the school in that area that connection could be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13562)|
| 3:46:11| in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13571)|
| 3:46:12| But again, there is nothing in the condition that's being removed that deals with direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13572)|
| 3:46:19| access to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13579)|
| 3:46:21| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13581)|
| 3:46:24| That's a nice house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13584)|
| 3:46:28| Is that your retirement house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13588)|
| 3:46:30| I'm already in my retirement house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13590)|
| 3:46:34| That may be Mike's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13594)|
| 3:46:36| Oh, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13596)|
| 3:46:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13597)|
| 3:46:37| Oh, oh, gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13597)|
| 3:46:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13600)|
| 3:46:40| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13600)|
| 3:46:41| I'm assuming that you, Mr. Harbin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13601)|
| 3:46:50| Mr. Harbin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13610)|
| 3:46:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13613)|
| 3:46:53| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13613)|
| 3:46:54| Yes, I can hear you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13614)|
| 3:46:56| Are you the, are you the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13616)|
| 3:46:58| I am the applicant, and I request, once again, is to postpone this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13618)|
| 3:47:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13625)|
| 3:47:06| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13626)|
| 3:47:09| Yes, Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13629)|
| 3:47:11| Yes, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13631)|
| 3:47:14| Thank you, Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13634)|
| 3:47:15| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13635)|
| 3:47:18| I sent an email in that summarizes most of the thoughts that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13638)|
| 3:47:22| We've talked about this at Knox County Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13642)|
| 3:47:25| And this one is, it's really confusing why to relieve the requirement, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13645)|
| 3:47:31| what's already been agreed to, to put the required, you know, sidewalks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13651)|
| 3:47:36| You know, sidewalks, you know, encourage, you know, residents to move and circulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13656)|
| 3:47:41| I think neighbors recently with the COVID-19 stay-at-home have been using their sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13661)|
| 3:47:47| a lot more often, and the neighborhoods that don't have sidewalks have found that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13667)|
| 3:47:52| a lacking thing that they've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13672)|
| 3:47:55| You know, sidewalks give children a place to play that's not in the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13675)|
| 3:47:59| One of the things that we've seen in Edwards Place is where they have streets and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13679)|
| 3:48:03| don't have the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13683)|
| 3:48:04| The kids are playing in the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13684)|
| 3:48:06| Sometimes even the adults are playing in the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13686)|
| 3:48:09| Sidewalks remove conflicts from people and vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13689)|
| 3:48:13| This is really, you know, this one, you know, especially, you know, it's in the parental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13693)|
| 3:48:17| responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13697)|
| 3:48:18| I mean, this is adjacent to South Doyle High School, so it seems really likely there'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13698)|
| 3:48:22| be some residents of the subdivision that would actually be able to walk to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13702)|
| 3:48:27| And then finally, just in general fairness, you know, developers and builders all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13707)|
| 3:48:33| time when standards are raised later or in progress, if they've already pulled their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13713)|
| 3:48:38| permit, you know, they can go with their lower standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13718)|
| 3:48:41| So, you know, you make stricter lighting standards or something like that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13721)|
| 3:48:45| they kind of get grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13725)|
| 3:48:47| On this case, you know, we've lowered the sidewalk requirement standards, and so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13727)|
| 3:48:52| not holding them to what they were previously accountable for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13732)|
| 3:48:54| So that just kind of speaks also to basic fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13734)|
| 3:48:58| On behalf of Knox County Planning Alliance, you know, we oppose this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13738)|
| 3:49:03| We think sidewalks are really good for neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13743)|
| 3:49:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13745)|
| 3:49:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13746)|
| 3:49:10| Mr. Harbin, you've got your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13750)|
| 3:49:12| I'd like to respond to that if I could, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13752)|
| 3:49:14| You certainly may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13754)|
| 3:49:15| Yeah, what's happened out here is the county commissioner, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13755)|
| 3:49:21| Carson Daly, has contacted my client, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13761)|
| 3:49:25| Perry Smith, concerning the sidewalks, and he has a meeting set up with the people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13765)|
| 3:49:30| live out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13770)|
| 3:49:31| I think there's some common ground that the county commissioner and my owner want to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13771)|
| 3:49:39| together and meet with that people that actually live out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13779)|
| 3:49:43| We can give an invitation to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13783)|
| 3:49:46| Murphy, and perhaps he can drive from his East Knox County home to help protect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13786)|
| 3:49:52| rights of the people he's concerned about in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13792)|
| 3:49:56| So I would ask this commission to give us 30 days to meet with our county commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13796)|
| 3:50:00| and the people that live out there so we can make some kind of an agreement with sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13800)|
| 3:50:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13805)|
| 3:50:06| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13806)|
| 3:50:06| Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13806)|
| 3:50:07| I think that the name of the commission or association that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13807)|
| 3:50:16| Murphy is referring to is the Knox County Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13816)|
| 3:50:23| It doesn't say East Knox County or South Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13823)|
| 3:50:26| So I appreciate that we do have a citizens group that is watchful of development in all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13826)|
| 3:50:34| areas of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13834)|
| 3:50:37| We're going to go to commission on this now, starting with Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13837)|
| 3:50:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13845)|
| 3:50:48| I'm going to make a motion to postpone for 30 days, but I'm going to preface that by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13848)|
| 3:50:54| saying that when a plan is approved and recorded in the Register of Deeds office, that allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13854)|
| 3:51:02| the developer to sell the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13862)|
| 3:51:05| Under the condition that improvements are made and the property owners are expecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13865)|
| 3:51:10| the improvements that are set up by the Planning Commission that the Planning Commission approves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13870)|
| 3:51:17| I will not support releasing the sidewalks on this development unless all the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13877)|
| 3:51:25| owners in the subdivision are accounted for and they agree to it in writing and meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13885)|
| 3:51:34| and release the Planning Commission and developer from installing sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13894)|
| 3:51:40| I think it's only right for the residents who probably paid for these sidewalks in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13900)|
| 3:51:49| acquiring the property, be reimbursed whatever money is in escrow in a bond or a letter of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13909)|
| 3:51:58| credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13918)|
| 3:51:59| Because this is surety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13919)|
| 3:52:00| It's surety that these people, residents of this neighborhood, are going to get the improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13920)|
| 3:52:07| that was guaranteed to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13927)|
| 3:52:09| And to come back at this later date and say, no, we changed our mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13929)|
| 3:52:15| To me, that doesn't cut it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13935)|
| 3:52:17| I think the county's a huge liability in situations like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13937)|
| 3:52:22| When they accept a letter of credit or a bond, they're acting like a pseudo-developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13942)|
| 3:52:28| In the event of the developer either defaulting on the project or not completing his requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13948)|
| 3:52:34| But I'll make a motion to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13954)|
| 3:52:38| I'll second, but I'd like to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13958)|
| 3:52:43| You can, just one second, Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13963)|
| 3:52:46| I just want to reiterate that we have a motion by Commissioner Phillips to postpone for 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13966)|
| 3:52:52| days and a second by Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13972)|
| 3:52:54| And now the floor is yours, Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13974)|
| 3:52:57| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13977)|
| 3:52:59| One, in the staff report, it calls for two-thirds or 50% of the lots have been platted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13979)|
| 3:53:08| Where the sidewalks are or where they should be, only four lots would be concerned, would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13988)|
| 3:53:18| be involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13998)|
| 3:53:19| And probably when they filed the application, there was probably only two that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=13999)|
| 3:53:26| had driveways poured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14006)|
| 3:53:29| Driveways are poured more on the outer band where the sidewalks aren't concerned, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14009)|
| 3:53:37| not on the inner band.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14017)|
| 3:53:38| There's only four bins poured there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14018)|
| 3:53:41| So 50, it might lead you to thinking there's a lot been done, but there hasn't been much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14021)|
| 3:53:49| done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14029)|
| 3:53:50| The other thing is I had a subdivision that we took the sidewalks out at the owner's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14030)|
| 3:54:00| And David Harbin was part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14040)|
| 3:54:03| We had to submit a plat with every homeowner signature on there that they agreed to removing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14043)|
| 3:54:13| the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14053)|
| 3:54:14| And in addition to that, I made a contribution to the homeowners association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14054)|
| 3:54:22| So that was their request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14062)|
| 3:54:27| As a matter of fact, the president of the homeowners association came down and appeared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14067)|
| 3:54:36| before commission when that came up and said that, yes, they did want them removed or removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14076)|
| 3:54:42| from the plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14082)|
| 3:54:44| The reason being they didn't want sidewalks too close to their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14084)|
| 3:54:48| They'd rather walk in the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14088)|
| 3:54:51| So that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14091)|
| 3:54:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14094)|
| 3:54:55| Make one more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14095)|
| 3:54:56| Yes, that's exactly why we're asking for the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14096)|
| 3:54:59| Mr. Daley is meeting with residents out there and himself to broker such a deal and contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14099)|
| 3:55:06| and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14106)|
| 3:55:08| That's why we need the 30 days for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14108)|
| 3:55:09| That's why we've asked for a 30 day postponement instead of just going ahead and accepting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14109)|
| 3:55:14| the staff conditions that we could have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14114)|
| 3:55:16| We asked for the 30 day postponement to meet with the neighbors out there and with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14116)|
| 3:55:20| Daley as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14120)|
| 3:55:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14128)|
| 3:55:38| I don't know if you can hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14138)|
| 3:55:42| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14142)|
| 3:55:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14144)|
| 3:55:45| Having problems with my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14145)|
| 3:55:52| Mr. Smith, you did have your hand raised, but we are, I see it's down now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14152)|
| 3:55:57| So we're going to go on to Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14157)|
| 3:56:00| Yes, I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14160)|
| 3:56:02| One question would be for the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14162)|
| 3:56:04| When was the sidewalk condition lifted from this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14164)|
| 3:56:14| The sidewalk condition still applies to this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14174)|
| 3:56:18| So, I mean, they're asking for that condition to be released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14178)|
| 3:56:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14181)|
| 3:56:23| And when was the first, this might be for Mr. Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14183)|
| 3:56:26| When was the first property started to be built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14186)|
| 3:56:29| Basically, that first lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14189)|
| 3:56:35| I'm not really sure when the first house was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14195)|
| 3:56:37| I do know about, I think it's 2018, 2019 is when construction of the subdivision actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14197)|
| 3:56:43| started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14203)|
| 3:56:44| So we've been under construction for a year and a half, two years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14204)|
| 3:56:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14207)|
| 3:56:47| I can't really tell you when the first house was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14207)|
| 3:56:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14210)|
| 3:56:51| My thought on this, because I think in our agenda review, a couple of commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14211)|
| 3:56:55| brought up the fact that it might be, a lot of homeowners may not want their front driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14215)|
| 3:57:01| torn up to have this installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14221)|
| 3:57:04| And my thought is that this started to be built without sidewalks, knowing the condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14224)|
| 3:57:10| was held with the potential for having to tear up someone's yard, and now they're wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14230)|
| 3:57:15| it lifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14235)|
| 3:57:16| So I don't know that this was ever planned to be installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14236)|
| 3:57:20| I can imagine that they never intended to do it because if they were going to, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14240)|
| 3:57:24| would have started by now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14244)|
| 3:57:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14246)|
| 3:57:29| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14249)|
| 3:57:30| Yeah, I was just going to say that a 30-day postponement with an applicant is a very reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14250)|
| 3:57:35| request, especially we have a county commissioner that wants to attend a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14255)|
| 3:57:39| Let's vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14259)|
| 3:57:41| I don't think there's any point in continuing discussion on something that's probably going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14261)|
| 3:57:45| to get postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14265)|
| 3:57:46| And if that vote fails, then we can get back into discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14266)|
| 3:57:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14271)|
| 3:57:52| Just always want to make sure that everybody's heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14272)|
| 3:57:56| Um, so we have a motion on the floor by Commissioner Phillips, a second by Commissioner Graff to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14276)|
| 3:58:01| postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14281)|
| 3:58:02| Mr. Wise, roll please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14282)|
| 3:58:05| Mr. Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14285)|

| 3:58:15| Mr. Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14295)|

| 3:58:17| Mr. Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14297)|
| 3:58:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14298)|
| 3:58:19| Mr. Graff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14299)|
| 3:58:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14300)|
| 3:58:21| Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14301)|
| 3:58:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14302)|
| 3:58:23| Mr. Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14303)|
| 3:58:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14304)|
| 3:58:25| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14305)|
| 3:58:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14306)|
| 3:58:27| Mr. Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14307)|
| 3:58:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14308)|
| 3:58:29| Ms. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14309)|
| 3:58:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14310)|
| 3:58:31| Ms. Stoker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14311)|
| 3:58:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14312)|
| 3:58:33| And that is the unanimous decision on item 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14313)|
| 3:58:37| Item 21 was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14317)|
| 3:58:39| So we're on to item number 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14319)|
| 3:58:48| This is a use on review report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14328)|
| 3:58:51| The applicant is Tom Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14331)|
| 3:58:54| The location is the north and south sides of Nixon Road at the intersection of Sevierville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14334)|
| 3:59:01| west side of John Norton Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14341)|
| 3:59:05| Approximate size of the tract is 41.45 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14345)|
| 3:59:10| The zoning is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14350)|
| 3:59:13| Existing land use is residential and vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14353)|
| 3:59:16| The proposed use is rural retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14356)|
| 3:59:20| And the staff recommendation is to approve the development plan for the rural retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14360)|
| 3:59:25| with an event facility pavilion building with approximately 8,000 square feet for up to 300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14365)|
| 3:59:32| guests and a maximum of nine overnight accommodations subject to 10 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14372)|
| 3:59:39| Mr. Breschko, I was asked previous to this meeting if you would give just a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14379)|
| 3:59:44| of background on this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14384)|
| 3:59:49| Thank you, Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14389)|
| 3:59:51| Members of the Commission, this request for a rural retreat had been before the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14391)|
| 3:59:57| Commission at their March meeting this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14397)|
| 4:00:01| At that time, there was a request to have the rural retreat to have special events such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14401)|
| 4:00:08| as weddings and other similar things like family reunions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14408)|
| 4:00:13| The proposal at that time originally included a tent structure for the special events and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14413)|
| 4:00:24| the original application actually had a permanent pavilion that was a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14424)|
| 4:00:29| When they made revisions prior to the Planning Commission's meeting, they removed the permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14429)|
| 4:00:35| structure and obtained approval for the event facility to be the 3,200 square foot tent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14435)|
| 4:00:43| They were proposing to be able to have up to 300 guests at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14443)|
| 4:00:47| The proposed location for access is off of Sevierville Pike, which has not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14447)|
| 4:00:54| And actually, the layout of the entire facility is on the north side of Nixon Road, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14454)|
| 4:00:59| pretty much the same in this new proposal level as it was in the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14459)|
| 4:01:05| In addition to that original tent structure for the special events, there was a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14465)|
| 4:01:11| a support building for the site that included office space, a staff area, a restroom and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14471)|
| 4:01:19| storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14479)|
| 4:01:21| And what they have done in the new request that they've submitted is to include all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14481)|
| 4:01:27| into this one proposed pavilion building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14487)|
| 4:01:31| It has gone from a 3,200 square foot tent to an 8,000 square foot facility, but it includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14491)|
| 4:01:39| all that within the pavilion, which is, again, the kind of a gathering area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14499)|
| 4:01:46| There's a kitchen proposed in the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14506)|
| 4:01:48| There's office and support area for staff, and there are restrooms that are all part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14508)|
| 4:01:53| of this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14513)|
| 4:01:55| So basically, the change is to go from the proposed temporary tent structure to a permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14515)|
| 4:02:02| pavilion for the rural retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14522)|
| 4:02:05| One issue that has been raised through this process, and my guess is there will be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14525)|
| 4:02:09| discussion on that, is that under the ordinance, although a part of this requires consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14529)|
| 4:02:16| as a larger retreat facility because of the accommodations, it has been staff's position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14536)|
| 4:02:27| that the Part B section regarding large retreats does not apply here because that refers to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14547)|
| 4:02:35| a facility for conferences and banquets, restaurant, or day spa, and there's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14555)|
| 4:02:42| restaurant or day spa proposed for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14562)|
| 4:02:44| There are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14564)|
| 4:02:45| This is not proposed as a conference facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14565)|
| 4:02:48| I know there's been issue raised that there are banquets that would be held here, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14568)|
| 4:02:53| therefore it's subject to those other standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14573)|
| 4:02:57| But part of the problem we're dealing with is that there's not definitions within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14577)|
| 4:03:02| ordinance for conference banquet facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14582)|
| 4:03:07| But when you look at that section of the ordinance, if you have one of those components| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14587)|
| 4:03:14| as a part of this, you have to meet all the criteria, which means you would also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14594)|
| 4:03:20| to provide a minimum of 30 guest accommodations on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14600)|
| 4:03:24| You'd have to have 50 acres where they have 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14604)|
| 4:03:28| And when you look at it, the staff's position, again, dealing, talking to county codes about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14608)|
| 4:03:36| this administration, that you have to look at that complete picture under Part B as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14616)|
| 4:03:44| all the facilities that would be provided or required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14624)|
| 4:03:46| And it is looking at a large facility that has, again, a minimum of 30 accommodations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14626)|
| 4:03:53| plus for restaurant and other components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14633)|
| 4:03:56| And we feel it doesn't qualify for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14636)|
| 4:03:59| The first rural retreat that was ever approved in the county was for a 10-acre site that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14639)|
| 4:04:05| had a 7,000-square-foot building that was being built for events such as weddings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14645)|
| 4:04:11| And we feel this is very similar to that type of facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14651)|
| 4:04:15| And just out of curiosity, the support building that is now going to be incorporated in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14655)|
| 4:04:22| pavilion building, was there a size on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14662)|
| 4:04:28| I'm not sure what the size wasn't identified as far as the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14668)|
| 4:04:34| The applicant may know what the size of that building was, but it was on the western end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14674)|
| 4:04:41| of the driveway access in the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14681)|
| 4:04:43| And again, it was for support staff, restroom and storage area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14683)|
| 4:04:50| And again, they've incorporated all that into this one building in the new proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14690)|
| 4:04:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14694)|
| 4:04:57| Thank you very much for that background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14697)|
| 4:05:00| I know that some of the commissioners may have additional questions, but for right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14700)|
| 4:05:04| we're going to go to the applicant, which I'm assuming is Daniel Levy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14704)|
| 4:05:10| I see that you're on board here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14710)|
| 4:05:15| And we have opposition, Corinne Rivetti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14715)|
| 4:05:19| Is there other opposition or are you the only one speaking today, Corinne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14719)|
| 4:05:24| I believe I'm the only one speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14724)|
| 4:05:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14726)|
| 4:05:28| Mr. Levy, do you want to go first or opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14728)|
| 4:05:33| I'll go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14733)|
| 4:05:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14734)|
| 4:05:36| Name and address for the records, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14736)|
| 4:05:38| Daniel Levy, 3523 Maloney Road, Knoxville, Tennessee 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14738)|
| 4:05:44| Just wanted to thank, start off by thanking the staff and the commission for their time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14744)|
| 4:05:51| in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14751)|
| 4:05:52| I know this has been a process and particular Tom Bretschko.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14752)|
| 4:05:57| And I know we've gone back and forth a lot and just for just the due diligence and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14757)|
| 4:06:03| the effort that's been put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14763)|
| 4:06:04| Just want to thank you and Art and Janice, thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14764)|
| 4:06:10| One of the things that came out of the March meeting was some good feedback and questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14770)|
| 4:06:14| that we wanted to address in this updated proposal, as well as some feedback we got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14774)|
| 4:06:20| from the property owners, as well as updated information from our civil and grading engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14780)|
| 4:06:26| teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14786)|
| 4:06:27| And so we really feel like the program and the square footages and what we were doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14787)|
| 4:06:34| on site hasn't changed, but the location has changed mainly due to site accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14794)|
| 4:06:41| It wasn't practical where the permanent tent structure was previously to have good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14801)|
| 4:06:47| accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14807)|
| 4:06:48| The other thing that we wanted to be sensitive to was the open air nature of our wedding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14808)|
| 4:06:56| venues was going to have some sound pollution and just other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14816)|
| 4:06:59| So by enclosing the structure, we were helping the surrounding properties with any potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14819)|
| 4:07:05| conflicts with sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14825)|
| 4:07:07| We think we've designed a very nice, beautiful building that looks like it's been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14827)|
| 4:07:11| for years and will fit nicely into the setting with a series of significant landscape buffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14831)|
| 4:07:17| to shield the properties and any parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14837)|
| 4:07:22| We've reduced the amount of parking spaces that are facing adjacent property owners and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14842)|
| 4:07:27| tuck them more into the woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14847)|
| 4:07:29| We think that that is a reflection of some of the comments we got from the previous meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14849)|
| 4:07:35| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14855)|
| 4:07:36| So overall, we think we've addressed some, like I said, the property owner comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14856)|
| 4:07:43| as well as some site accessibility issues that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14863)|
| 4:07:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14868)|
| 4:07:53| Before we go to the opposition, I believe Commissioner Roth, are you still there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14873)|
| 4:08:03| Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14883)|
| 4:08:04| Yes, but I'm going to have to go though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14884)|
| 4:08:06| I just needed you to state that publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14886)|
| 4:08:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14890)|
| 4:08:11| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14891)|
| 4:08:12| So Commissioner Roth is leaving the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14892)|
| 4:08:18| Been real, Jack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14898)|
| 4:08:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14899)|
| 4:08:22| So we are going to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14902)|
| 4:08:24| Ms. Rivetti?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14904)|
| 4:08:26| I think that we had received a notice from Mr. Murphy that he's going to be doing a screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14906)|
| 4:08:36| share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14916)|
| 4:08:37| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14917)|
| 4:08:38| That would be correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14918)|
| 4:08:40| I'm ready to share my screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14920)|
| 4:08:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14922)|
| 4:08:48| Okay, Ms. Rivetti, you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14928)|
| 4:08:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14931)|
| 4:08:52| Corinne Rivetti, 6925 Suberville Pike, Knoxville 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14932)|
| 4:08:59| I just want to start off by saying that I think this is a project with a lot of history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14939)|
| 4:09:04| that goes along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14944)|
| 4:09:05| We have some new folks that are on the commission, and I really suggest that they familiarize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14945)|
| 4:09:11| themselves with the history of boundary pushing, violations, and infractions that have defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14951)|
| 4:09:18| the Ancient Lore Village process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14958)|
| 4:09:20| So with that said, yet again, I appear before this body to represent and protect my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14960)|
| 4:09:29| As I recently wrote and reminded you all that after a long and contentious year and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14969)|
| 4:09:34| in March, a resolution was agreed upon and approved with 10 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14974)|
| 4:09:40| Peace has finally resided within our community, accepting Ancient Lore Village as a small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14980)|
| 4:09:47| rural retreat wedding and event venue with a 3,200 square foot temporary event tent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14987)|
| 4:09:57| Now, less than three months later, here we are again with yet another plan, and there have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=14997)|
| 4:10:03| numerous plans and zoning requests that's part of the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15003)|
| 4:10:07| And we feel that this request is pushing boundaries yet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15007)|
| 4:10:12| And so we're here to petition the commission to uphold the county's regulations and ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15012)|
| 4:10:18| and deny this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15018)|
| 4:10:21| Our community wants to put this project to rest in completion already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15021)|
| 4:10:26| Let's get a plan, stick with the plan, and be sure that the plan complies with the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15026)|
| 4:10:34| I don't think that's really too much to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15034)|
| 4:10:37| How many more times will there be a new plan that, and with major changes that will come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15037)|
| 4:10:41| before us, upsetting the community yet again when we thought we'd come to some agreements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15041)|
| 4:10:47| And when will it be submitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15047)|
| 4:10:49| Every three months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15049)|
| 4:10:50| Every six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15050)|
| 4:10:51| Yearly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15051)|
| 4:10:53| And then what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15053)|
| 4:10:54| Will we see this sort of slow and insidious piecemealing erosion of the regulations as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15054)|
| 4:11:02| they're intended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15062)|
| 4:11:03| So, you know, regulations are not a random thing that you get to pick and choose from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15063)|
| 4:11:09| So our group, the Keep the Urban Wilderness Peaceful, sent you a detailed letter enumerating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15069)|
| 4:11:15| the bending of the regulations that we see here and the clear violations contained in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15075)|
| 4:11:21| this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15081)|
| 4:11:23| The main and most obvious violation is the structural restrictions placed on land parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15083)|
| 4:11:29| whether they're less than 50 acres or more than 50 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15089)|
| 4:11:33| And that is in the Knox County Ordinance Item Number 4.104.03, the criteria for larger scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15093)|
| 4:11:42| retreats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15102)|
| 4:11:43| In conversation with Mr. Breschko, he has unsuccessfully explained the rationale for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15103)|
| 4:11:50| approving an 8,000 square foot pavilion with a catering kitchen for banquets on a 41.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15110)|
| 4:11:59| acre parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15119)|
| 4:12:01| That is quite a huge change from what was just approved for a 3,200 square foot temporary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15121)|
| 4:12:08| event tent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15128)|
| 4:12:10| I think the argument belies in the definition of the use of this pavilion and the definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15130)|
| 4:12:17| of a conference banquet facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15137)|
| 4:12:21| Given the farther stretch of interpretation of this ordinance, it's hard to justify the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15141)|
| 4:12:26| approval of this larger scale pavilion as anything but a conference banquet facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15146)|
| 4:12:33| appropriate only for a 50 acre parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15153)|
| 4:12:36| You know, this is kind of like the pink elephant in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15156)|
| 4:12:40| You can call it a blue elephant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15160)|
| 4:12:42| You can even call it a giraffe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15162)|
| 4:12:43| At the end of the day, it's a pink elephant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15163)|
| 4:12:47| At the end of the day, no matter how you try to split hairs, and I kind of feel like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15167)|
| 4:12:52| planning staff has split hairs here, on the definition between what is vaguely termed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15172)|
| 4:12:58| as an event venue versus a conference banquet facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15178)|
| 4:13:03| And I think we have some definitions that will be showing up here on what a banquet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15183)|
| 4:13:08| is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15188)|
| 4:13:09| Ms. Rivetti, you have about 30 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15189)|
| 4:13:11| Okay, well, I'm going to ask for an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15191)|
| 4:13:14| I've been on this call for a very long time, and I would like a little bit more time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15194)|
| 4:13:18| Every one of us has been on this call for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15198)|
| 4:13:21| I understand, but extension of time has been given to several other people, so I'm hoping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15201)|
| 4:13:25| that I can also get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15205)|
| 4:13:28| Yes, so anyway, so this pavilion is clearly a conference banquet hall, which is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15208)|
| 4:13:33| for a larger scale rural retreat and should be best subject to the 50 acre rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15213)|
| 4:13:39| Okay, is this an attempt to bypass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15219)|
| 4:13:43| And this is where we have not a lot of trust with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15223)|
| 4:13:47| Is it an attempt to bypass what would be other restrictions if it's considered a larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15227)|
| 4:13:53| retreat, which for one thing would be a traffic impact study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15233)|
| 4:13:56| So we have some concerns there and some of the other issues that Mr. Breschko clarified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15236)|
| 4:14:03| as far as what would be part of a larger retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15243)|
| 4:14:07| And then, you know, I have to ask the question, if this is approved, where is the oversight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15247)|
| 4:14:16| I think there's a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15256)|
| 4:14:17| If you go back and look at when this rural retreat ordinance was approved, it was stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15257)|
| 4:14:23| at that point that there's very little oversight that we see in this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15263)|
| 4:14:29| And so, you know, we basically have a facility that's designed and equipped as a banquet hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15269)|
| 4:14:38| Looks like a banquet hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15278)|
| 4:14:40| So who's going to monitor what these other events, wedding events are pretty clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15280)|
| 4:14:46| These other events, which can easily include conferences, and we have a banquet facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15286)|
| 4:14:54| capability here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15294)|
| 4:14:56| Who is going to monitor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15296)|
| 4:14:57| Who's going to oversight that these events are in compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15297)|
| 4:15:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15302)|
| 4:15:04| I know Mr. Breschko keeps citing the 7,000 square foot building on 10 acres approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15304)|
| 4:15:09| several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15309)|
| 4:15:10| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15310)|
| 4:15:11| That seems like that was a pretty bad decision and that that violated the ordinances and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15311)|
| 4:15:17| we're setting that as a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15317)|
| 4:15:19| So that's a clear danger of setting bad precedents and the continuing eroding sequelae that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15319)|
| 4:15:26| We're saying don't correct a bad decision with yet another bad decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15326)|
| 4:15:32| And if the rural retreat ordinance needs cleaning up improvement, as both Mr. Breschko and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15332)|
| 4:15:40| Green stated in Tuesday's agenda review meeting, then we say clean up the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15340)|
| 4:15:47| If there's too much ambiguity, which there certainly seems to be in many cases, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15347)|
| 4:15:52| fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15352)|
| 4:15:53| But we also contend that there is no ambiguity in the criteria laid out for the larger scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15353)|
| 4:15:59| rural retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15359)|
| 4:16:00| The only ambiguity we are discussing today is one of definition of this proposal's vague| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15360)|
| 4:16:06| use of a vent venue and the proposed pavilion's intended use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15366)|
| 4:16:13| Okay, Ms. Rivetti, we had given you two minutes extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15373)|
| 4:16:17| Are you wrapping up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15377)|
| 4:16:20| Yeah, I just have my closing statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15380)|
| 4:16:22| So it doesn't seem like there's much choice here, but to reject the staff's approval of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15382)|
| 4:16:27| this project, clean up and improve the rural retreat ordinance, and then invite projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15387)|
| 4:16:34| to submit plans that meet the newly revamped ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15394)|
| 4:16:38| We, the surrounding community, strongly encourage this body to use its oversight authority to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15398)|
| 4:16:44| uphold the standards of land use regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15404)|
| 4:16:46| Thanks so much for the extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15406)|
| 4:16:48| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15408)|
| 4:16:48| I appreciate not only your comments, but also the fact that, yes, this has been a longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15408)|
| 4:16:55| than normal planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15415)|
| 4:17:00| Yeah, and I'm available to answer any questions or any other input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15420)|
| 4:17:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15424)|
| 4:17:05| As is Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15425)|
| 4:17:07| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15427)|
| 4:17:09| I think that we, I don't see Mr. Levy's hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15429)|
| 4:17:13| So, Commissioner Hill, we're going to go with you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15433)|
| 4:17:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15440)|
| 4:17:21| I'm just wondering how we got back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15441)|
| 4:17:24| I thought we were done with this some months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15444)|
| 4:17:27| I think we're all a little fatigued from it, but nonetheless, I want to ask Mr. Breschko,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15447)|
| 4:17:33| how do we differentiate from this banquet hall event thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15453)|
| 4:17:41| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15461)|
| 4:17:42| It just seems so easy to get around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15462)|
| 4:17:45| And this feels like such more of a permanent kind of a restaurant use facility than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15465)|
| 4:17:53| was imagined or agreed upon by the neighborhood, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15473)|
| 4:17:58| So, I'm just trying to get to the fact of what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15478)|
| 4:18:02| And has the construction begun on this facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15482)|
| 4:18:09| Mr. Breschko?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15489)|
| 4:18:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15490)|
| 4:18:16| They've been doing some work on site, but it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15496)|
| 4:18:18| Well, actually, I'll let the applicant respond as far as what they may be doing on that prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15498)|
| 4:18:23| approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15503)|
| 4:18:26| One of the things I've mentioned before is that some of the language in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15506)|
| 4:18:31| creates issues on interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15511)|
| 4:18:36| But the intent of this, when we had originally proposed the rural retreat, was to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15516)|
| 4:18:44| special event facilities in rural areas where they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15524)|
| 4:18:48| And in a lot of cases, we had requests that people wanted to use existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15528)|
| 4:18:52| structures or barns and stuff for special events such as weddings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15532)|
| 4:18:59| I'm not sure how you can have a wedding event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15539)|
| 4:19:02| That was the intent when this came up originally, how you can have a wedding and expect that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15542)|
| 4:19:08| there's not going to be some food prepared or available for a reception with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15548)|
| 4:19:13| The idea was also whether there were family reunions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15553)|
| 4:19:19| I know that the facility that exists out off the North Shore, that they've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15559)|
| 4:19:28| you know, one of the political parties may have a kind of reception for candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15568)|
| 4:19:34| There have been a number of things that have been done under these special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15574)|
| 4:19:38| So I don't know that you could say that because there's a kitchen associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15578)|
| 4:19:44| food preparation, whether it's catered or if you had a family reunion that your family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15584)|
| 4:19:49| came in and prepared food in the kitchen for the event that you're having at that facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15589)|
| 4:19:54| that you can't have one of these without a kitchen as part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15594)|
| 4:19:59| And, you know, they've incorporated, you know, facilities within here that support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15599)|
| 4:20:07| special events such as weddings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15607)|
| 4:20:10| There's a condition recommended in the approval that this would not be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15610)|
| 4:20:16| it's not being approved as a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15616)|
| 4:20:20| They are not proposing to have a sit-down restaurant where you can come in and order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15620)|
| 4:20:25| food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15625)|
| 4:20:25| I mean, this is to be utilized for special events that are scheduled at this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15625)|
| 4:20:31| What's on the second floor there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15631)|
| 4:20:33| Is that for the wedding gathering or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15633)|
| 4:20:37| The applicant needs to probably respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15637)|
| 4:20:41| Mr. Levy, can you address two issues, which is what is being built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15641)|
| 4:20:48| what is in current stages of development and actually just Commissioner Hill's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15648)|
| 4:20:56| Yeah, so currently on site under the grading permit that we've received from Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15656)|
| 4:21:03| the village dwellings which were approved, the eight additional dwellings which were approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15663)|
| 4:21:09| under the last rural retreat application that grading and site retention and environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15669)|
| 4:21:15| work is being currently worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15675)|
| 4:21:18| The second story that you see, this is a thatched roof, heavy timber structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15678)|
| 4:21:24| And those are clear story windows and a loft level that will have seating overlooking the main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15684)|
| 4:21:32| dance floor for the wedding venue space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15692)|
| 4:21:35| That's what you're seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15695)|
| 4:21:36| Those are the clear story windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15696)|
| 4:21:40| And I kind of go back just briefly speak to some of the concerns that were brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15700)|
| 4:21:47| And, you know, this has been a lengthy process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15707)|
| 4:21:50| This started at over 100 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15710)|
| 4:21:54| And then in January, it was shrunk to 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15714)|
| 4:21:56| And we really tried to work as much as we could, as much as we would let us and incorporate their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15716)|
| 4:22:03| ideas and concerns into the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15723)|
| 4:22:05| And now we've gone from over 100 to 30 down to eight or nine dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15725)|
| 4:22:10| And I think some of the intent is confusing from the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15730)|
| 4:22:15| what they're really pushing for with getting a larger retreat designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15735)|
| 4:22:20| on this site would bring us up to needing to build 30 dwellings, which we'd love to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15740)|
| 4:22:28| That was one of our initial concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15748)|
| 4:22:30| But I don't think the opposition really wants more dwellings on this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15750)|
| 4:22:34| unless they're telling us differently today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15754)|
| 4:22:38| So if we do go with a large retreat and a restaurant and a traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15758)|
| 4:22:43| which we've done a traffic study before, we would then get to do the additional dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15763)|
| 4:22:49| So I think this is what we have here is a really good compromise and a win for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15769)|
| 4:22:55| And this venue will really be an asset to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15775)|
| 4:23:01| It's going to be a beautiful structure and a beautiful place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15781)|
| 4:23:04| There's a ton of landscaping and natural elements and walking trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15784)|
| 4:23:08| And I think the community as a whole will benefit from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15788)|
| 4:23:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15790)|
| 4:23:14| Commissioner Corbelic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15794)|
| 4:23:18| I'm quite torn regarding the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15798)|
| 4:23:21| And I think maybe it's actually helpful that I'm so new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15801)|
| 4:23:25| I don't have much history to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15805)|
| 4:23:26| So I'm looking at it fresh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15806)|
| 4:23:29| I echo the same question that Commissioner raised before to the staff, to Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15809)|
| 4:23:35| I, we've got four words floating around event, conference, banquet facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15815)|
| 4:23:42| and then the webpage advertises the place as appropriate for business meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15822)|
| 4:23:48| I have no idea how staff would be able to enforce any of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15828)|
| 4:23:54| To me, if I have a family reunion and I'm having a banquet, I mean, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15834)|
| 4:24:01| And I also understand that the criteria state that if you meet any one of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15841)|
| 4:24:09| so whether you're an event or a conference, you're serving in a banquet facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15849)|
| 4:24:17| I'm torn because I like the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15857)|
| 4:24:20| I think it encloses some of the noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15860)|
| 4:24:23| They've done a good job on buffering from the perimeter of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15863)|
| 4:24:28| I don't see any problem with the property itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15868)|
| 4:24:32| But I am concerned about the definitions and the process and the perception of the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15872)|
| 4:24:40| that they're getting tired of feeling that this is a never ending struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15880)|
| 4:24:47| I just wanted to express that I'm torn both ways here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15887)|
| 4:24:51| I don't know what I think yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15891)|
| 4:24:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15893)|
| 4:24:54| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15894)|
| 4:24:58| Yes, I have to say I'm surprised this is back before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15898)|
| 4:25:03| in just three months after we approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15903)|
| 4:25:06| When back when we approved this previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15906)|
| 4:25:08| I was really torn at that point with the 3200 square foot event tent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15908)|
| 4:25:14| And the thing that convinced me to support that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15914)|
| 4:25:17| was because the neighborhood had worked with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15917)|
| 4:25:20| There were conditions that were put on to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15920)|
| 4:25:23| They had the dark sky lighting provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15923)|
| 4:25:26| And they told us it was the tent would only be up when rented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15926)|
| 4:25:30| And it was just a 3200 square foot tent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15930)|
| 4:25:33| So I think for this to come back so soon to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15933)|
| 4:25:36| it doesn't really matter to me what we call this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15936)|
| 4:25:40| I think the jump to 8000 square feet is not appropriate for this particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15940)|
| 4:25:46| Can I speak to that just for a minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15946)|
| 4:25:51| Is that you, Mr. Levy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15951)|
| 4:25:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15953)|
| 4:25:54| So I want to make sure that we understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15954)|
| 4:25:56| in the previous approved rural retreat application was not just a tent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15956)|
| 4:26:02| but there was also a 1200 square foot admin building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15962)|
| 4:26:05| that contained a kitchen, restrooms, offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15965)|
| 4:26:09| And that program is now inside the pavilion building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15969)|
| 4:26:15| So it's what you see, the 40 by 30 structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15975)|
| 4:26:19| that is at the end of the cul-de-sac there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15979)|
| 4:26:22| That's no longer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15982)|
| 4:26:24| That program is now inside the pavilion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15984)|
| 4:26:27| So it wasn't just a 3500 square foot tent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15987)|
| 4:26:31| And that was clearly documented in our narrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15991)|
| 4:26:35| under the previous application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15995)|
| 4:26:37| Yes, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=15997)|
| 4:26:40| But let me ask a follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16000)|
| 4:26:42| Does that mean that you are not going to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16002)|
| 4:26:44| any outdoor weddings or any rental tents on site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16004)|
| 4:26:55| This is Melissa Blattner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16015)|
| 4:26:57| I'm the general manager for Ancient Law Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16017)|
| 4:27:00| And I'm just speaking on behalf of Daniel here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16020)|
| 4:27:06| Could you give us your address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16026)|
| 4:27:07| Yeah, my address is 453 Union Road in Brooklyn, Wisconsin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16027)|
| 4:27:11| 53521.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16031)|
| 4:27:16| I've been working on this project also for over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16036)|
| 4:27:19| I'm working with Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16039)|
| 4:27:20| So I understand all the iterations that have gone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16040)|
| 4:27:24| And really, one of the things that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16044)|
| 4:27:26| just from an operational standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16046)|
| 4:27:28| one of the reasons why we got to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16048)|
| 4:27:31| and why we're here in front of you again today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16051)|
| 4:27:33| is because as we got into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16053)|
| 4:27:36| once we had the approval in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16056)|
| 4:27:39| and then we engaged with our civil engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16059)|
| 4:27:43| and looked at things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16063)|
| 4:27:44| it really became clear, as often projects do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16064)|
| 4:27:48| and to try and work as much as we can with the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16068)|
| 4:27:52| to be able to enclose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16072)|
| 4:27:53| And that was the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16073)|
| 4:27:55| of one of the commissioners back in March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16075)|
| 4:27:57| that we should have an enclosed pavilion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16077)|
| 4:28:00| So that's really why we're here in front of you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16080)|
| 4:28:03| We haven't begun work on this pavilion at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16083)|
| 4:28:06| We're trying to stay in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16086)|
| 4:28:08| with all of the permits and ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16088)|
| 4:28:13| to make sure that we're not trying to sneak something by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16093)|
| 4:28:18| but we really feel that this is in the best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16098)|
| 4:28:20| So the question was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16100)|
| 4:28:25| is there going to be a tent or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16105)|
| 4:28:27| that could be put up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16107)|
| 4:28:30| I think that there's locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16110)|
| 4:28:33| like for outdoor weddings and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16113)|
| 4:28:35| in the woods that a ceremony would take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16115)|
| 4:28:39| And that I don't think is uncommon of those rural retreats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16119)|
| 4:28:42| So yes, there would be not receptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16122)|
| 4:28:46| but definitely ceremonies that could take place outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16126)|
| 4:28:51| But the pavilion, our goal is to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16131)|
| 4:28:54| to keep sound pollution, noise pollution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16134)|
| 4:28:58| inside of that structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16138)|
| 4:29:01| Yeah, this is Corinne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16141)|
| 4:29:04| I have two points I need to make, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16144)|
| 4:29:08| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16148)|
| 4:29:09| It seems that it's very clear for weddings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16149)|
| 4:29:12| What's unclear are all those other event venues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16152)|
| 4:29:15| that remain undefined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16155)|
| 4:29:18| The other thing is now twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16158)|
| 4:29:20| I've heard both Melissa and Daniel talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16160)|
| 4:29:25| since the March approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16165)|
| 4:29:27| that there's been community input for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16167)|
| 4:29:30| There has been absolutely no communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16170)|
| 4:29:32| with the community to discuss this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16172)|
| 4:29:36| In fact, the first thing we knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16176)|
| 4:29:37| is when that planning commission sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16177)|
| 4:29:41| for use on review went up a few weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16181)|
| 4:29:45| was the first inclination that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16185)|
| 4:29:47| that there was another plan on the table yet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16187)|
| 4:29:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16191)|
| 4:29:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16192)|
| 4:29:54| At this point, I think that I'd kind of like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16194)|
| 4:29:57| to keep the conversation within the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16197)|
| 4:30:01| If you do have any direct questions, then ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16201)|
| 4:30:05| Otherwise, Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16205)|
| 4:30:12| I think Commissioner Graff had his hand up at one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16212)|
| 4:30:15| Commissioner Graff, did I miss, did I overlook it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16215)|
| 4:30:18| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16218)|
| 4:30:19| I don't have the microphone button| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16219)|
| 4:30:22| or raise your hand on my screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16222)|
| 4:30:25| I have to kind of interrupt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16225)|
| 4:30:27| but I just have a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16227)|
| 4:30:31| The compromise that they spoke of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16231)|
| 4:30:35| that we made a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16235)|
| 4:30:39| with the surrounding neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16239)|
| 4:30:44| that was three months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16244)|
| 4:30:46| And it's like we're chasing a moving target here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16246)|
| 4:30:51| We agree to one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16251)|
| 4:30:53| The neighborhood agrees to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16253)|
| 4:30:56| We get it settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16256)|
| 4:30:57| But three months later, we're back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16257)|
| 4:31:00| and we're going to double the size of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16260)|
| 4:31:03| or we're going to incorporate the administration building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16263)|
| 4:31:07| Well, that only adds up to about 4,400 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16267)|
| 4:31:13| And you're asking for 8,500 permanent square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16273)|
| 4:31:17| You just pick at the corners all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16277)|
| 4:31:20| And I can't believe that anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16280)|
| 4:31:24| that is as organized as you seem to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16284)|
| 4:31:30| don't realize that when you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16290)|
| 4:31:33| oh, we didn't realize that we needed a larger facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16293)|
| 4:31:38| We didn't realize we needed that three months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16298)|
| 4:31:43| I don't accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16303)|
| 4:31:45| I think that you just get what you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16305)|
| 4:31:49| and we'll come back in two or three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16309)|
| 4:31:51| and pick away and see what we get then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16311)|
| 4:31:55| I'm not in favor of this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16315)|
| 4:31:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16318)|
| 4:32:00| Thank you, Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16320)|
| 4:32:02| Commissioner Vint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16322)|
| 4:32:05| Yes, I agree with Commissioner Graf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16325)|
| 4:32:07| in that this proposed facility is double| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16327)|
| 4:32:11| even the combination of the tent and the admin building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16331)|
| 4:32:16| Also, I understand that the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16336)|
| 4:32:19| doesn't have a definition of banquet hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16339)|
| 4:32:21| But if this were to be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16341)|
| 4:32:23| the next step might be plans review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16343)|
| 4:32:25| When you go to plans review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16345)|
| 4:32:26| chapter three of the IBC classifies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16346)|
| 4:32:31| what a banquet hall is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16351)|
| 4:32:33| And it is an occupancy in which people congregate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16353)|
| 4:32:36| in high densities for social entertainment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16356)|
| 4:32:38| including drinking and dancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16358)|
| 4:32:40| And in parentheses, it says nightclubs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16360)|
| 4:32:42| banquet halls, cabarets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16362)|
| 4:32:45| or food and drink consumption restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16365)|
| 4:32:47| Under that chapter, restaurants, cafeterias,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16367)|
| 4:32:50| and similar dining facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16370)|
| 4:32:52| And in parentheses, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16372)|
| 4:32:53| including associated commercial kitchens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16373)|
| 4:32:55| which the catering kitchen would be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16375)|
| 4:32:57| a commercial kitchen occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16377)|
| 4:33:00| So if the idea is that this is not a banquet hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16380)|
| 4:33:04| so we're not going to have any facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16384)|
| 4:33:06| When you go to plans review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16386)|
| 4:33:08| this would be considered a banquet hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16388)|
| 4:33:10| Then you could check that box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16390)|
| 4:33:12| And I heard Mr. Levy say that the intention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16392)|
| 4:33:14| was originally to have more than nine facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16394)|
| 4:33:17| I think you could check those boxes and then say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16397)|
| 4:33:20| well, now we do have a banquet hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16400)|
| 4:33:22| So now we can have 30 facilities, just to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16402)|
| 4:33:25| I think at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16405)|
| 4:33:28| then the requirement for the 50 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16408)|
| 4:33:32| would come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16412)|
| 4:33:34| And from my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16414)|
| 4:33:36| there is more than Ms. Boyd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16416)|
| 4:33:39| or maybe it's Boyd Hollow Resorts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16419)|
| 4:33:43| owns more property than is being incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16423)|
| 4:33:47| Is that correct, Mr. Levy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16427)|
| 4:33:55| Anyway, Commissioner Corbelli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16435)|
| 4:34:01| Yes, I had a question for Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16441)|
| 4:34:04| I don't know, is the applicant able to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16444)|
| 4:34:08| for a variance to lot size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16448)|
| 4:34:12| Is that an avenue to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16452)|
| 4:34:19| It could request a variance to lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16459)|
| 4:34:23| Do you think that's merit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16463)|
| 4:34:28| I have not looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16468)|
| 4:34:30| I have not looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16470)|
| 4:34:33| In regard to the lot size and the 50 acre requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16473)|
| 4:34:37| the property owner does have an additional nine acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16477)|
| 4:34:40| that would take him over 50 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16480)|
| 4:34:44| which is what would take us into that larger retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16484)|
| 4:34:47| and allow the additional dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16487)|
| 4:34:49| But again, I think the intent and where the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16489)|
| 4:34:55| where we had agreed to and what we all felt good about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16495)|
| 4:34:59| was the lower density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16499)|
| 4:35:02| If we need to go back to the 30 accommodations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16502)|
| 4:35:06| that works great for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16506)|
| 4:35:07| but I don't think it works as good for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16507)|
| 4:35:09| So I think this is a win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16509)|
| 4:35:11| Addressing the size and how the pavilion got bigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16511)|
| 4:35:17| and going to the building code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16517)|
| 4:35:18| when you have an outdoor tent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16518)|
| 4:35:20| you don't have to deal with things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16520)|
| 4:35:22| like wheelchair accessibility and space between tables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16522)|
| 4:35:26| and walking space and access to bathrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16526)|
| 4:35:29| the same way you would inside a conditioned building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16529)|
| 4:35:33| So the square footage of the building got bigger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16533)|
| 4:35:38| not because we increased the occupants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16538)|
| 4:35:40| It's still based on the same 300 person max event space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16540)|
| 4:35:44| It's just based on the basic quality of care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16544)|
| 4:35:48| and building standards now that it's an enclosed structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16548)|
| 4:35:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16553)|
| 4:35:54| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16554)|
| 4:35:56| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16556)|
| 4:35:58| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16558)|
| 4:36:01| for the rural retreat with an events facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16561)|
| 4:36:04| with approximately 8,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16564)|
| 4:36:06| for up to 300 guests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16566)|
| 4:36:07| and a maximum of nine overnight accommodations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16567)|
| 4:36:10| subject to the 10 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16570)|
| 4:36:12| I second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16572)|
| 4:36:16| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16576)|
| 4:36:18| a second by Commissioner Phillips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16578)|
| 4:36:21| to approve the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16581)|
| 4:36:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16583)|
| 4:36:24| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16584)|
| 4:36:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16586)|
| 4:36:29| I see no more hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16589)|

| 4:37:17| Passes 7-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16637)|
| 4:37:20| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16640)|
| 4:37:21| I urge the commissioners to, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16641)|
| 4:37:29| it sounds like the things that changed here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16649)|
| 4:37:32| was the size of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16652)|
| 4:37:37| same number of guests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16657)|
| 4:37:39| but and same number of overnight accommodations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16659)|
| 4:37:44| Mr. Levy, I just am hopeful that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16664)|
| 4:37:47| this is the end of your requests on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16667)|
| 4:37:54| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16674)|
| 4:37:56| I enjoy talking with you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16676)|
| 4:37:58| but hopefully we don't do it anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16678)|
| 4:38:00| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16680)|
| 4:38:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16682)|
| 4:38:03| We are going to move on to agenda item number 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16683)|
| 4:38:13| And I'm scrolling to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16693)|
| 4:38:17| So use on review report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16697)|
| 4:38:21| The applicant is East Knoxville Stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16701)|
| 4:38:25| The location is the south side of Julian Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16705)|
| 4:38:28| north side of Flint Gap Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16708)|
| 4:38:31| east side of Kennedy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16711)|
| 4:38:34| Approximate size of the tract is 31.9 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16714)|
| 4:38:39| The zoning is A, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16719)|
| 4:38:42| Existing land use is vacant and house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16722)|
| 4:38:45| The proposed use is a mining operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16725)|
| 4:38:49| Staff recommendation is to deny the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16729)|
| 4:38:51| for a mining and mineral extraction operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16731)|
| 4:38:54| and the associated mining plan of operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16734)|
| 4:38:58| because the use will have an adverse impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16738)|
| 4:39:00| on the character of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16740)|
| 4:39:02| in which the site is located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16742)|
| 4:39:04| and significantly injure the value of adjacent property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16744)|
| 4:39:07| by noise, lights, fumes, odors, vibration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16747)|
| 4:39:12| traffic congestion and other impacts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16752)|
| 4:39:16| which may detract from the immediate environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16756)|
| 4:39:20| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16760)|
| 4:39:24| That you, Mr. Tucker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16764)|
| 4:39:28| Unmute, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16768)|

| 4:39:36| Yes, I'm representing the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16776)|
| 4:39:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16778)|
| 4:39:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16779)|
| 4:39:40| I'm assuming that Ms. Verklis and Mr. Kline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16780)|
| 4:39:45| are both part of opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16785)|
| 4:39:47| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16787)|
| 4:39:48| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16788)|
| 4:39:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16789)|
| 4:39:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16791)|
| 4:39:51| Mr. Tucker, do you want to go first or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16791)|
| 4:39:54| They can go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16794)|
| 4:39:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16796)|
| 4:39:58| Mr. Kline and Ms. Verklis, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16798)|
| 4:40:02| if I'm mispronouncing your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16802)|
| 4:40:04| You're close enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16804)|
| 4:40:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16805)|
| 4:40:06| If one of you wants to go first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16806)|
| 4:40:09| we'll time you and let you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16809)|

| 4:40:18| May I go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16818)|
| 4:40:20| That is quite all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16820)|
| 4:40:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16822)|
| 4:40:23| Good afternoon, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16823)|

| 4:40:31| I represent the Marbledale community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16831)|
| 4:40:33| with support from adjacent communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16833)|
| 4:40:35| including Riverdale, Ramsey, Kodak, and the Dora Kennedy community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16835)|
| 4:40:40| all in opposition to East Knoxville Stone's application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16840)|
| 4:40:44| for a mining and mineral extraction operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16844)|
| 4:40:47| at this Julian Lane, Flint Gap Road, and Kennedy Road site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16847)|
| 4:40:52| Marbledale is a strong and vibrant residential community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16852)|
| 4:40:56| mostly single family and rural residential homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16856)|
| 4:40:59| developed in the RA and A zones that surround this parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16859)|
| 4:41:04| which is covered by the East Knox County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16864)|
| 4:41:07| However, adjacent to the applicant's 31.98 joint parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16867)|

| 4:41:17| To the north of the applicant site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16877)|
| 4:41:20| several residences, including the house of Janice Verklis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16880)|
| 4:41:25| whom you have specific correspondence from in your pocket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16885)|

| 4:41:36| and the associated mining plan of operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16896)|
| 4:41:39| because of the adverse impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16899)|
| 4:41:41| on the character of the neighborhood in which the site is located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16901)|
| 4:41:44| and the significant injury to the value of adjacent property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16904)|
| 4:41:48| from noise, lights, fumes, odors, blasting, vibration, traffic congestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16908)|
| 4:41:54| all which come along with a mining operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16914)|

| 4:42:59| have developed since the shutdown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16979)|
| 4:43:01| of mining operations of this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16981)|
| 4:43:03| Residences, newly built homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16983)|
| 4:43:05| and lots of investment in existing homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16985)|
| 4:43:08| to modernize and bring them up to current living standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16988)|

| 4:43:16| have encouraged this residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16996)|
| 4:43:19| through sector plans and the zoning of RA adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=16999)|

| 4:43:26| To now reintroduce mining at this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17006)|
| 4:43:29| is contrary to residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17009)|
| 4:43:31| that has grown through the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17011)|
| 4:43:32| to make this a vibrant local community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17012)|
| 4:43:35| and an asset to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17015)|
| 4:43:38| Inadequate roads for the heavy truck traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17018)|
| 4:43:40| that must travel from a major arterial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17020)|
| 4:43:43| that's John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17023)|
| 4:43:45| through a minor collector street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17025)|
| 4:43:47| Flint Gap Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17027)|
| 4:43:48| which is not always 20 foot wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17028)|
| 4:43:50| and doesn't always have shoulders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17030)|
| 4:43:52| is another important reason to deny this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17032)|
| 4:43:56| The interception of Thorn Grove Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17036)|
| 4:43:59| and Flint Gap Road can be presently dangerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17039)|
| 4:44:02| let alone introducing heavy truck traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17042)|

| 4:44:07| from the proposed mining site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17047)|
| 4:44:10| Flint Gap Road and to some degree Thorn Grove Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17050)|
| 4:44:13| are not suited for frequent trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17053)|
| 4:44:15| by large heavy trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17055)|
| 4:44:17| because of this minimally satisfactory road width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17057)|
| 4:44:20| and the lack of adequate shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17060)|
| 4:44:22| Kevin Murphy's letter to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17062)|
| 4:44:25| provides specific illustrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17065)|
| 4:44:27| of the inadequacy of the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17067)|
| 4:44:29| as it relates to blasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17069)|
| 4:44:31| I will add that the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17071)|
| 4:44:33| in no way takes into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17073)|
| 4:44:36| the community in which its land is located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17076)|
| 4:44:39| or the effect the proposed mining operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17079)|
| 4:44:41| will have on the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17081)|
| 4:44:43| which is not the way neighbors should behave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17083)|
| 4:44:47| In summary, there's good reason to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17087)|
| 4:44:49| the Marble Dove community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17089)|

| 4:45:15| would have an adverse impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17115)|
| 4:45:17| on the character of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17117)|

| 4:45:23| of the Marble Dove community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17123)|
| 4:45:24| we respectfully request you deny this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17124)|
| 4:45:27| And if the applicant's reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17127)|
| 4:45:29| for requesting postponement for 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17129)|
| 4:45:32| is to initiate discussions with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17132)|

| 4:45:43| Ms. Verklis, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17143)|
| 4:45:45| Mr. Klein took up the entire five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17145)|
| 4:45:48| Did you have anything very quickly to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17148)|
| 4:45:52| or did he pretty much state the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17152)|

| 4:46:08| of this mining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17168)|
| 4:46:09| I just like to add that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17169)|
| 4:46:13| not only are our homes and our whales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17173)|
| 4:46:17| could possibly be affected by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17177)|
| 4:46:19| but we have a lot of wildlife out here also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17179)|
| 4:46:22| I work with young Williams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17182)|
| 4:46:25| Spain community cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17185)|
| 4:46:27| We have deer, turkey, possum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17187)|
| 4:46:30| I mean, it's a wonderful, peaceful place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17190)|
| 4:46:33| I've been here three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17193)|
| 4:46:36| and I beseech on you to please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17196)|
| 4:46:40| deny the request for the mining operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17200)|
| 4:46:43| Thank you, Ms. Verklis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17203)|
| 4:46:46| Mr. Tucker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17206)|
| 4:46:49| Yes, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17209)|
| 4:46:51| Yeah, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17211)|
| 4:46:52| Yes, Garrett Tucker, 7523 Taggart Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17212)|
| 4:46:57| First of all, thank you, Ms. Tucker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17217)|
| 4:47:00| and ARC for your service and Tom Bretko.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17220)|
| 4:47:05| Tom's been doing this 20 years at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17225)|
| 4:47:08| That's about how long I've been doing subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17228)|
| 4:47:12| and site development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17232)|
| 4:47:13| Before that, I was actually working in coal mining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17233)|
| 4:47:17| for another 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17237)|
| 4:47:19| the first part of my career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17239)|
| 4:47:21| And so I know a little bit about mining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17241)|
| 4:47:26| and you just bring up the word mining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17246)|
| 4:47:28| and of course it's a negative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17248)|
| 4:47:30| you know, most people have a negative thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17250)|
| 4:47:31| right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17251)|
| 4:47:32| So, but the fact is we do benefit from mining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17252)|
| 4:47:37| These computers and cell phones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17257)|
| 4:47:40| and stuff that we're using are made from materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17260)|
| 4:47:43| that are mined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17263)|
| 4:47:43| The copper wiring in our houses comes from mining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17263)|
| 4:47:47| Our electricity is produced from mining, most of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17267)|
| 4:47:51| So, and of course, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17271)|
| 4:47:52| this operation is for a limestone mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17272)|
| 4:47:55| which goes into housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17275)|
| 4:47:57| goes into a lot of road building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17277)|
| 4:48:00| And so what we're wanting to do here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17280)|
| 4:48:01| is to create a small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17281)|
| 4:48:03| it's not a huge mining operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17283)|
| 4:48:07| I don't think it will last a tremendous long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17287)|
| 4:48:10| And our belief is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17290)|
| 4:48:14| it won't be such an impact to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17294)|
| 4:48:16| I think that's a knee-jerk reaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17296)|
| 4:48:19| that everybody jumps to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17299)|
| 4:48:20| because you say the word mining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17300)|
| 4:48:23| We're leaving these gigantic buffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17303)|
| 4:48:26| around the property for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17306)|
| 4:48:30| you know, and for that reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17310)|
| 4:48:31| I think it will be virtually unnoticeable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17311)|
| 4:48:37| and I think that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17317)|
| 4:48:38| it can actually be a benefit to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17318)|
| 4:48:42| We were asked to have a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17322)|
| 4:48:44| and I understand that the people didn't want to attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17324)|
| 4:48:45| and I'm very sensitive to everyone's concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17325)|
| 4:48:50| that live nearby this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17330)|
| 4:48:51| I totally understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17331)|
| 4:48:55| And we tried to have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17335)|
| 4:48:57| We were asked to by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17337)|
| 4:48:59| and we scheduled one and we put notice up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17339)|
| 4:49:02| and only one person showed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17342)|
| 4:49:05| which was Mr. Mike Harper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17345)|
| 4:49:07| who lives on the other side of Flint Gap Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17347)|
| 4:49:10| And there is some drainage problems that he has in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17350)|
| 4:49:14| and we believe that this mining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17354)|
| 4:49:16| would actually help solve that drainage problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17356)|
| 4:49:20| You know, I mentioned I worked in coal mining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17360)|
| 4:49:23| Part of the coal mining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17363)|
| 4:49:25| was to establish a post-mining land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17365)|
| 4:49:28| of what this is gonna be when the mining is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17368)|
| 4:49:31| And like I said, it's not gonna last that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17371)|
| 4:49:34| We're giving up only about 30% of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17374)|
| 4:49:37| is actually gonna be mined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17377)|
| 4:49:39| by the time you leave these buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17379)|
| 4:49:43| And that's gonna go a long way toward providing sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17383)|
| 4:49:46| insulation from sound and dust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17386)|
| 4:49:48| And, you know, there's a ton of permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17388)|
| 4:49:50| you've got to get to be able to get a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17390)|
| 4:49:54| with the Mine Safety and Health Administration with TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17394)|
| 4:49:58| So there's a lot of approvals that will address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17398)|
| 4:50:01| As far as blasting, that will not be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17401)|
| 4:50:04| But, you know, once or twice a month at the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17404)|
| 4:50:08| there will be monitors set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17408)|
| 4:50:10| at every house will be offered a pre-blast survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17410)|
| 4:50:13| There would be monitoring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17413)|
| 4:50:16| seismographic monitoring done at each dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17416)|
| 4:50:19| Anytime there was a shot put off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17419)|
| 4:50:22| it would be scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17422)|
| 4:50:23| It would be done for all the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17423)|
| 4:50:28| So, you know, we had asked to postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17428)|
| 4:50:30| We were kind of late in getting our request in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17430)|
| 4:50:32| but I understand maybe the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17432)|
| 4:50:35| don't wanna talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17435)|
| 4:50:39| But we feel like, you know, the post-mine land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17439)|
| 4:50:42| this could be a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17442)|
| 4:50:43| this could be a swimming hole, a fishing hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17443)|
| 4:50:47| We feel like it could be a benefit to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17447)|
| 4:50:51| These are fairly major roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17451)|
| 4:50:52| They're 20 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17452)|
| 4:50:55| I'm just kind of surprised that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17455)|
| 4:50:56| there's just no discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17456)|
| 4:51:00| It's just, hey, there's no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17460)|
| 4:51:03| And, you know, one consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17463)|
| 4:51:09| there could be a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17469)|
| 4:51:10| that the roads have to be widened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17470)|
| 4:51:13| That would be something that could be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17473)|
| 4:51:16| But we are gonna widen at the entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17476)|
| 4:51:18| and provide some decel lanes and an acceleration lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17478)|
| 4:51:22| So we would just request at the least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17482)|
| 4:51:29| that we could postpone this for 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17489)|
| 4:51:31| or we could maybe work with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17491)|
| 4:51:35| if they're willing to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17495)|
| 4:51:36| if they're willing to meet us at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17496)|
| 4:51:40| you know, make some concessions or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17500)|
| 4:51:42| But we would ask at least for a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17502)|
| 4:51:46| as we'd originally requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17506)|
| 4:51:48| You're requesting a postponement, not a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17508)|
| 4:51:51| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17511)|
| 4:51:52| Okay, that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17512)|
| 4:51:53| It's been a long day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17513)|
| 4:51:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17516)|
| 4:51:57| We're gonna go to commission now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17517)|
| 4:52:02| Okay, Mr. Tucker, your hand's still up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17522)|
| 4:52:04| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17524)|
| 4:52:06| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17526)|
| 4:52:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17528)|
| 4:52:09| And Mr. Tucker, I'm not opposed to mining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17529)|
| 4:52:12| I'm just opposed to mining in inappropriate places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17532)|
| 4:52:16| with inadequate infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17536)|
| 4:52:19| and then just the negative impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17539)|
| 4:52:21| it has on the surrounding neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17541)|
| 4:52:24| In the application, I think you all illustrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17544)|
| 4:52:26| three other mines in the general area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17546)|
| 4:52:30| and there are substantial differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17550)|
| 4:52:35| when you compare those mines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17555)|
| 4:52:37| Two of those mines have direct access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17557)|
| 4:52:40| to a major road, John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17560)|
| 4:52:44| which then could either hit Asheville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17564)|
| 4:52:46| or go up Charle Plains Pike and hit the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17566)|
| 4:52:50| The third one that you illustrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17570)|
| 4:52:52| has basically its own dedicated road called Cinder Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17572)|
| 4:52:56| which is just probably 300 yards or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17576)|
| 4:53:00| from John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17580)|
| 4:53:02| So, those are important factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17582)|
| 4:53:05| when you look at the transportation infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17585)|
| 4:53:09| for these heavy trucks going in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17589)|
| 4:53:12| Now, let's look at this particular one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17592)|
| 4:53:13| that you're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17593)|
| 4:53:15| It is more internal to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17595)|
| 4:53:19| and most likely a good part of the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17599)|
| 4:53:23| will leave and get on Flint Gap Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17603)|
| 4:53:26| and then if they're headed toward the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17606)|
| 4:53:29| the best path is really to Wayland Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17609)|
| 4:53:32| Those are two very inadequate roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17612)|
| 4:53:35| very winding roads to get where they need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17615)|
| 4:53:40| I just don't see anything that could...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17620)|
| 4:53:43| You couldn't widen enough roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17623)|
| 4:53:45| to make this satisfactory in my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17625)|
| 4:53:48| because the roads that you're taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17628)|
| 4:53:50| are all of these two lane narrow roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17630)|
| 4:53:54| to either get to John Sevier Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17634)|
| 4:53:56| or to get to Charle Plains Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17636)|
| 4:53:58| which would then lead you to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17638)|
| 4:54:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17640)|
| 4:54:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17641)|
| 4:54:03| Commissioner Corbelic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17643)|
| 4:54:06| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17646)|

| 4:54:10| and I'd like to point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17650)|
| 4:54:12| I don't see a need for a 60-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17652)|
| 4:54:16| Regardless of discussions with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17656)|
| 4:54:20| the amount of truck traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17660)|
| 4:54:22| dust, potential water pollution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17662)|
| 4:54:24| noise and vibration will are part of mining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17664)|
| 4:54:29| And if you're going to mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17669)|
| 4:54:30| you're going to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17670)|
| 4:54:32| You can't not have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17672)|
| 4:54:34| So I see no need for the postponement myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17674)|
| 4:54:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17678)|

| 4:54:54| The use will have an adverse impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17694)|
| 4:54:56| on the character of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17696)|
| 4:54:59| in which the site is located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17699)|
| 4:55:01| and significantly injure the value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17701)|

| 4:55:25| Seeing no other hands up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17725)|

| 4:56:20| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17780)|
| 4:56:26| The next item on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17786)|
| 4:56:29| I was really kind of excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17789)|
| 4:56:32| I still am excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17792)|
| 4:56:35| One of the elements within the news voting ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17795)|
| 4:56:41| is plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17801)|
| 4:56:44| And part of the options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17804)|
| 4:56:47| that when someone has planned development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17807)|
| 4:56:50| is to be able to present a preliminary plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17810)|
| 4:56:53| to the commission to get vote, not votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17813)|
| 4:56:58| to get feedback and impressions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17818)|
| 4:57:01| and things that the commission feels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17821)|
| 4:57:05| they would like to see within the preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17825)|

| 4:57:18| but I hope that each of us can give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17838)|
| 4:57:20| just a little bit more time and energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17840)|
| 4:57:25| and attention to taking a look at this plan development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17845)|

| 4:57:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17859)|

| 4:57:43| That's my loved wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17863)|
| 4:57:44| So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17864)|
| 4:57:45| don't want to confuse looks and the crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17865)|
| 4:57:47| Bless your heart for saying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17867)|
| 4:57:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17872)|

| 4:58:20| And the proposed use is a pocket neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17900)|
| 4:58:22| with passive recreational land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17902)|

| 4:58:29| Staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17909)|
| 4:58:31| This plan is being submitted under the optional concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17911)|
| 4:58:35| section of plan development procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17915)|

| 4:58:40| but should provide feedback and comments for the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17920)|
| 4:58:44| to use in further developing his plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17924)|

| 4:59:02| just kind of give us an overview or before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17942)|
| 4:59:06| maybe give us an overview for what this is the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17946)|
| 4:59:12| If you can give us an overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17952)|
| 4:59:13| of the next steps on plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17953)|
| 4:59:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17956)|

| 4:59:25| in a preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17965)|

| 4:59:28| to the planning commission for review and recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17968)|
| 4:59:32| Following review by the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17972)|
| 4:59:34| the preliminary plan goes on to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17974)|
| 4:59:37| for final approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17977)|
| 4:59:39| After approval of the preliminary plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17979)|
| 4:59:42| a final plan then incorporates any conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17982)|
| 4:59:44| placed on the preliminary plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17984)|
| 4:59:47| and also provides more construction details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17987)|
| 4:59:50| such as stormwater grading, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17990)|
| 4:59:52| is brought back to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17992)|
| 4:59:54| for final approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17994)|
| 4:59:55| Following final approval of the final plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17995)|
| 4:59:59| the applicant can proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=17999)|
| 5:00:01| with obtaining construction permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18001)|
| 5:00:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18005)|
| 5:00:07| Ms. Fortune, do you want to talk to this plan at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18007)|
| 5:00:12| or do you want to just hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18012)|
| 5:00:14| perhaps talk to this plan a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18014)|
| 5:00:17| and then I'm sure commission will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18017)|
| 5:00:19| some questions and feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18019)|
| 5:00:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18021)|
| 5:00:23| Well, basically, I do a lot of research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18023)|
| 5:00:25| into different types of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18025)|
| 5:00:27| and I've done, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18027)|
| 5:00:30| about seven or eight residential developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18030)|
| 5:00:32| mostly condos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18032)|
| 5:00:34| but I saw this property as a unique opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18034)|
| 5:00:37| to be able to develop something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18037)|
| 5:00:39| that I'd kind of seen before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18039)|
| 5:00:43| not harping on my Pinterest addiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18043)|
| 5:00:45| but I had seen some stuff on Pinterest before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18045)|
| 5:00:47| that's along these lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18047)|
| 5:00:50| and I just thought this would be a beautiful place for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18050)|
| 5:00:52| It's an all wooded site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18052)|
| 5:00:53| It's a very secluded spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18053)|
| 5:00:57| but very, very close to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18057)|
| 5:01:00| I can incorporate the modern farmhouse designs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18060)|
| 5:01:05| in the houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18065)|
| 5:01:06| but the other thing I like about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18066)|
| 5:01:08| once we played around with the actual design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18068)|
| 5:01:10| of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18070)|
| 5:01:11| instead of doing something sort of standardized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18071)|
| 5:01:13| where you come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18073)|
| 5:01:14| and just have like a little dead end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18074)|
| 5:01:15| or cul-de-sac at the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18075)|
| 5:01:17| I thought it'd be really fun to develop something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18077)|
| 5:01:20| where it developed more of a sense of community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18080)|
| 5:01:23| where if you come out your front porch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18083)|
| 5:01:26| you enter into a big common area instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18086)|
| 5:01:29| and I anticipate seeing a lot of gardens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18089)|
| 5:01:31| and trees and sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18091)|
| 5:01:34| and walking paths through the whole property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18094)|
| 5:01:37| Also, we're planning on doing a small dog park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18097)|
| 5:01:41| and sort of a fire pit gathering area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18101)|
| 5:01:45| that neighbors could come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18105)|
| 5:01:47| and just meet and mingle and talk about things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18107)|
| 5:01:52| So I just thought it's a unique piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18112)|
| 5:01:56| It's surrounded basically on all sides by woods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18116)|
| 5:01:59| and it's just gorgeous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18119)|
| 5:02:00| and I just thought this would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18120)|
| 5:02:02| just an opportune spot to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18122)|
| 5:02:06| I think I love the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18126)|
| 5:02:09| and I think that that'll be a very fun addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18129)|
| 5:02:16| and very creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18136)|
| 5:02:17| This is kind of the idea of planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18137)|
| 5:02:21| where it's creative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18141)|
| 5:02:22| but do any commissioners have any feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18142)|
| 5:02:27| any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18147)|
| 5:02:32| I know we're worn out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18152)|
| 5:02:34| Commissioner Eason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18154)|
| 5:02:40| You're muted, Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18160)|
| 5:02:42| Thanks, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18162)|
| 5:02:45| I do think this is a fun concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18165)|
| 5:02:47| I like the idea of a pocket neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18167)|
| 5:02:49| and some common areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18169)|
| 5:02:51| With this being a heavily wooded site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18171)|
| 5:02:53| and with it being hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18173)|
| 5:02:55| I think a couple of things that may be tricky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18175)|
| 5:02:58| making sure that the grading works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18178)|
| 5:03:00| without disturbing too much the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18180)|
| 5:03:01| and without losing too many of the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18181)|
| 5:03:04| So that's the only concern I have right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18184)|
| 5:03:05| and I know you probably haven't gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18185)|
| 5:03:07| into your civil engineering and grading plans yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18187)|
| 5:03:11| but looking at the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18191)|
| 5:03:14| that's one thing that made me think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18194)|
| 5:03:16| it'd be great to see how many of those trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18196)|
| 5:03:19| and how much of that area could be undisturbed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18199)|
| 5:03:22| especially if it has nice native plants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18202)|
| 5:03:24| versus some invasive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18204)|
| 5:03:26| Bless you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18206)|
| 5:03:27| Sorry, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18207)|
| 5:03:31| Commissioner Eason, just to respond to your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18211)|
| 5:03:34| what we've done, there are spots on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18214)|
| 5:03:37| that are less steep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18217)|
| 5:03:38| and so what we have done is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18218)|
| 5:03:40| I mean, we have looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18220)|
| 5:03:41| we've already designed the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18221)|
| 5:03:42| I actually had this project designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18222)|
| 5:03:45| quite a while back under the previous zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18225)|
| 5:03:47| and we just got caught up in the mass rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18227)|
| 5:03:51| that was done here recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18231)|
| 5:03:52| without ever passing the plan through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18232)|
| 5:03:56| but what we've done is concentrated the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18236)|
| 5:03:59| and the houses into the areas that are less steep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18239)|
| 5:04:01| and I'm not planning on touching any of the trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18241)|
| 5:04:05| that I don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18245)|
| 5:04:07| One of the things that we've pitched as a part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18247)|
| 5:04:10| is being able to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18250)|
| 5:04:13| it's sort of a, it's a gravel grid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18253)|
| 5:04:15| I don't know if you're familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18255)|
| 5:04:16| with a project down the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18256)|
| 5:04:18| called Richmond Orchard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18258)|
| 5:04:19| the little tiny house development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18259)|
| 5:04:22| yeah, but one of the things that they introduced me to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18262)|
| 5:04:26| just by going over there and take a look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18266)|
| 5:04:28| they've done a gravel grid system on their road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18268)|
| 5:04:31| and I did not know that that was available to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18271)|
| 5:04:36| but of course what that does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18276)|
| 5:04:37| is allow you to reduce the amount of non-permeable surface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18277)|
| 5:04:42| which reduces your stormwater detention requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18282)|
| 5:04:47| The second thing that my engineer and I have talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18287)|
| 5:04:50| to also reduce the stormwater requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18290)|
| 5:04:53| or not requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18293)|
| 5:04:54| but the amount of area that we would have to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18294)|
| 5:04:56| for detention is doing individual house detention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18296)|
| 5:05:02| underground within the common areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18302)|
| 5:05:04| and so what we would do would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18304)|
| 5:05:06| to catch the gutters on the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18306)|
| 5:05:11| into an underground system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18311)|
| 5:05:12| which would feed into almost like a septic field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18312)|
| 5:05:16| except it's strictly for rainwater in the common areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18316)|
| 5:05:19| So it would serve two purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18319)|
| 5:05:21| One, it would reduce the amount of area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18321)|
| 5:05:22| that we're going to have to disturb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18322)|
| 5:05:24| on the total development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18324)|
| 5:05:25| Second thing it would do would be to keep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18325)|
| 5:05:27| you know, all the areas well watered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18327)|
| 5:05:31| and so I think we are trying to creatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18331)|
| 5:05:33| think our way through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18333)|
| 5:05:34| to try to use as little of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18334)|
| 5:05:37| as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18337)|
| 5:05:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18338)|
| 5:05:39| I think those are great ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18339)|
| 5:05:41| and I'm familiar with both of those systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-200611?start=18341)|
