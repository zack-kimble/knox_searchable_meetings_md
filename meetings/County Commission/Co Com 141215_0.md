| 0:09:00| I'm here to complain about the school board and you guys for not returning phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=540)|
| 0:09:07| My kid is at West High School and another one at Bearden High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| and the school lunch program is charging us $70 for the first month of school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=552)|
| 0:09:19| that we didn't even, the kids haven't even been to school, and they charge us that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| and then they call in on Thanksgiving Day begging for the money that we owe them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| I call Jeff, I call a couple more of you commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| you guys don't want to return my phone calls, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| I just went to Nashville and complained to the Department of Education there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| Some guy named Clint, he returned my phone call, said he was going to work on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| try to figure out what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| He never called me back. I didn't expect him to call me back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| I didn't call on any doctor in D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| For some reason I got a response from D.C. but not from Knox County, but it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| I just wanted to let you guys know that, and I'm going to still support these teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| Let the teachers teach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| That's going to be my voice for the rest of, as long as my kids are in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| because these teachers are doing a great job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| and somebody needs to give them some credit for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| McIntyre doesn't want to give them credit for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| I call and try to get on his agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| They had the meeting set up in this building rather than the school board building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| Didn't tell me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| He didn't want me to be in front of him just to complain about these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| and to get a teacher some compliments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| We got a fifth-grade daughter at West Hills Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| She took their star reading test, and it says they were able to read at a grade level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=634)|
| 0:10:42| higher than 90% of all students nationally in the same grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=642)|
| 0:10:49| She's reading on a ninth-grade level, and she's only fifth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| I want to give credit to Ms. Countess, the teacher at West Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=654)|
| 0:11:01| and give Ms. Schoenleber and her current teacher, Ms. McKinn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| This is the only teacher that's challenging her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| She missed 28 days out of school last year because she was bored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| This year she has a teacher that's trying to push her to the extreme, and it's paying off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| Give the teacher some credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| But as long as Dr. McIntyre is trying to get money and take money, it ain't going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| I complained two years ago when that guy John Dickles took the job at a nutrition program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=685)|
| 0:11:33| I called downtown to the school board complaining about him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| and I even called him and talked to him and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| please come to this school today while I'm here and eat lunch with these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| Show them that the food is fit to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| He lied to me and told me he was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| I'm sitting at the school waiting until 115.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| He's still didn't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| I told him then he was a crook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| I told McIntyre they didn't want to listen to me then, but look what happened now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| And he sent me a letter with his signature on it two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| Right before he resigned, he sent me a letter with his name signed on the letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| begging for the $70 we owe them from West High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| and the $58 we owe them for Bearden High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| What he was going to do with the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| That's all I asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| Somebody got to look into this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| If you're supposed to go on to represent us in our district, return some phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| Lynn Fugate, she's in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| Never heard from that lady in the whole time she's been on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| And they say Jeff is our commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| I got in touch with Tony Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| He told me, yeah, he's your representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| He'll call you back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| I never heard from that guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=761)|

| 0:18:16| There's the handshake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| And I like to second everything Commissioner Wright said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| And also, you know, I think it's a testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| In fact, I think we're up to nine folks that are wanting to sit in your seat and take your place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| I'd say six years and 10 months ago, 11 months ago, that probably wouldn't have been the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1116)|
| 0:18:43| People were looking at us like, are you crazy for wanting to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| Now, I think you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| I don't think you've done a whole lot to restore the trust in Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| and county commission in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| and we look forward to the work you're going to do in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| in representing a majority of our county constituents as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| So thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| I'll just take a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| And I really do want to thank everyone for those kind words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| And I think Dave and Sam and many of you that were here almost seven years ago knows what a tough job it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1153)|
| 0:19:21| And right now, I think all of us are very proud to say we have served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| and that we are serving on the Knox County commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| The commission, you know, it's always been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| there's an old adage that the best government is the government that's closest to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| But it doesn't get any closer than it does when you're a city councilman or a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| And the things that we do that are good for people, you see every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| I mean, yeah, we do fix potholes and put up signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| but the things that affect people's lives every day, whether it's in the schools, how we live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| the law enforcement, how the counties run, really makes a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| And as I go to Nashville, I'm not going to forget that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| Too often in Nashville or at the federal level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| we're pushing regulations down on local people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| but it's the local people sitting right there in the seats where you're sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| and where I used to sit that affect people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| You know what's going on in the community, and we can't forget that you're closest to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| I'm going to stop right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| I've said enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| But it's the biggest honor that I've ever had to sit in the seats that you're sitting in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| and with these guys right here, and I want to thank everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| One more moment of personal privilege I would like for you to allow us to have our picture made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1236)|
| 0:21:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1261)|
| 0:21:19| Anything else for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| If not, I call this regular session meeting of the December Knox County Commission meeting to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1282)|

| 0:21:49| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| Eight members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| Commissioner Charlie Bussler, I call on you for today's devotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| I am proud to introduce one of the best people I've ever known, and he's been a mentor to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| His name is Dr. Jim Robertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| He's the ex-pastor emeritus from Sharon Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1327)|
| 0:22:15| Thank you, Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| Esteemed members of the commission, I'm honored to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| I was born and reared in Knox County, graduated from Fulton High School, three-time state champs now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1341)|
| 0:22:29| and for the last 43 years I've been a pastor in Knox County, and so I'm very grateful for your leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1349)|
| 0:22:41| We're in the season of Christmas, and you see all the decorations, and you could not escape it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1361)|
| 0:22:49| And I'm very mindful that, as a government body, you cannot endorse any particular religion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1369)|
| 0:22:58| and as a descendant of those Baptists who were persecuted, I'm very grateful for that and approve of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1378)|
| 0:23:08| Today we come in this season of the year where many will celebrate the birth of Jesus our Christ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1388)|
| 0:23:21| I've known Charlie for 32 years, and just a disclaimer, he's not responsible for what I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| and I'm not responsible for what he says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1407)|
| 0:23:34| At this season of the year, it seems that our hearts are warmer, our smiles are brighter, our spirits are lifted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1414)|
| 0:23:43| and we greet one another with such generosity and kindness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| And at the same time, we're mindful of the needs in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| We're mindful that we have the Empty Stocking Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| We have the Milk Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| We have all kinds of helps for the people in our community, many, many benevolent activities at this season of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1441)|
| 0:24:10| and people are generous and kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| And we remember the words of Jesus whose birth we celebrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| As he taught his disciples the golden rule, that whatsoever you would have men to do unto you, do ye also unto them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1461)|
| 0:24:30| He restated an old truth, and perhaps it's a truth that we need to hear again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| Because, you know, at its best, Christianity lives out that truth and lives out that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1476)|
| 0:24:43| At its best, Christianity is compassionate and kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| At its best, it builds schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| At its best, it builds orphanages that care for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| At its best, it builds hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| At its best, it lifts up people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| At its best, it's for the oppressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| At its best, it's for those who are often neglected and forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| So we're grateful today for Christianity at its best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| while we're mindful that sometimes Christianity is not at its best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| And for that, we do not give praise, but rather we hope that we may be bearers of that which will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1525)|
| 0:25:38| Christianity, at its worst, tries to impose its will and its interpretations on other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1538)|
| 0:25:47| At its worst, it entangles itself with governments, either trying to control governments or being a tool of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1547)|
| 0:25:58| At its worst, it abuses people, women and children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1558)|
| 0:26:05| At its worst, it amasses wealth and forgets others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| At its worst, it applauds hatred, prejudice, greed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1571)|
| 0:26:18| At its worst, it endorses war and killing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1578)|
| 0:26:25| That is not what we emphasize in the Christmas season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| What we emphasize are those things that we think are high and noble in Christ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1590)|
| 0:26:39| You know, all of us stand under this mandate of Jesus, do unto others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1599)|
| 0:26:47| It means that we think about others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| It means that others come first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| You've been elected to put others first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| And so this commandment, this teaching, falls on all of us, citizens and elected officials as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1616)|
| 0:27:06| And so as we come in this season, let us think about the noble parts of what we have been taught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1626)|
| 0:27:15| and that we may continue that and that we may leave behind those things that have been so destructive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1635)|
| 0:27:23| and let our leaders be fair and just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| Let us seek not the privilege of a few but to think wholly of all whom we serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1649)|
| 0:27:39| and that we may treat them with justice and kindness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| I was here the day that some of you were installed in your office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1664)|
| 0:27:52| and was here with Charlie, and I wrote a prayer for Charlie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| and with some modifications, I want to offer this prayer for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1678)|
| 0:28:08| Our Father in Heaven, on this day of new beginnings, new responsibilities, and new opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1688)|
| 0:28:16| we give you thanks and praise for your mercies and grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| We thank you for your patience, for your presence, and your guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| May you be honored by this commission's life and witness in the political arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| We pray that they will humble themselves to the sacred task of governing for all the people of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| Give them wisdom to be fair and true without regard to persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| Give them the power to resist every temptation and every pressure which will be presented to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1725)|
| 0:28:52| Help each one to do what is best, not what is expedient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| Help each to have a vision of community which enhances the brotherhood of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1737)|
| 0:29:03| Lord, please help each commissioner to measure their words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| Help them to speak with clarity and compassion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| Keep them from being sabotaged by well-meaning friends or opponents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| Give them the resilience to bear every criticism that will come their way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| Let them be free from personal agendas or vendettas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| Our Father, you have brought these commissioners to this moment to give a genuine Christian witness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| and to build a stronger world, inspire them, and protect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1774)|
| 0:29:41| We humbly ask all of this in the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Thank you, Pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| Commissioner Owen, you will lead the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| Everyone please stand and give the Prophets' salute to our nation's flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| Do I hear a motion to approve the minutes of the previous meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| Motion and second is properly before us to approve the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| Amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| Now, this is going to be somewhat complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| in that I'm going to read off the official record those that have been deferred until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1848)|
| 0:30:59| We're going to do deferreds first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| On page 6, 14-12-303, deferred to January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1863)|
| 0:31:16| Page 10, 14-12-901, deferred to January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1876)|
| 0:31:25| And page 11, 14-12-903, deferred to January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1885)|
| 0:31:36| That takes care of the deferrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| And one other deferral at the end in the discussion items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| the discussion regarding the Knox County Schools Activity Funds and PPU audits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| as I have placed on for discussion, will be deferred until the next work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1911)|
| 0:32:02| The next work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1922)|
| 0:32:11| Mr. Chair, I think you also wanted to bring an ordinance to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| The ordinance is going to come front as soon as we can get the agenda set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1935)|
| 0:32:23| Okay, now we're going to have withdrawals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| 14-12-902 on page 10 is the only withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1946)|
| 0:32:35| And now everyone else will have to take on their own additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| And there are several additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| The additions on page 13 we will cover first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1965)|
| 0:32:52| A discussion regarding the TCCA appointment and also is this in the form of a resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1972)|
| 0:33:05| As a discussion item, we'll discuss it now and we'll discuss it again at the end of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| that the commission on January the 12th, excuse me, yes, a special session will be held by commission January the 12th, 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=1990)|

| 0:33:39| representing the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| I'll make that motion. Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| It's been properly motioned and seconded that we have a meeting established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| to hear publicly those people that are seeking the 5th District seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2034)|
| 0:34:02| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| Do we have a second meeting following that that has been properly noted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| You have one notice for the public hearing, you have one notice for the actual session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| There are two separate meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| There is a notice for the public hearing and there is a subsequent notice for the called meeting to make the selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2057)|
| 0:34:30| What we're placing as an official record right now is that January the 12th at 4.30 is the public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2070)|
| 0:34:39| followed by the meeting, which will be the selection of the person to fill the seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| It's been properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| Is there further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| Yeah, that was kind of what I was getting at there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| Is it the presentations are going to start at 4.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| The special called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| Four o'clock is what the notice said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| Four o'clock is the notice for the hearing of people to speak, public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2103)|
| 0:35:11| This is a special called meeting to make the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| One is at four and one is at 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| Is that your light, Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| I need to add a discussion item, please, regarding breastfeeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| We need to get this one discussed and the vote taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2132)|
| 0:35:39| Is there a time limit on the time that the candidates will be able to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2139)|
| 0:35:45| Usually, it is give your name and address and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| But at the request of an individual commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| there may be circumstances that may allow for more minutes of talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2152)|
| 0:35:59| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| I guess kind of in that same line, I understand immediately after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| but I'm betting we're going to go way past 4.30 with this many candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2165)|
| 0:36:12| We can leave it at 4.30 because we say immediately afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| We'll have to leave it at the set time because that's the announcement in the media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| where we have to make the announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| Other discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| On this appointment, Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| you had raised the question that you hoped there would be a public forum presented by someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| which may allow for the presentation of people making the request for the appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2196)|
| 0:36:43| other than here in county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| If you recall, the Board of Education appointment was for three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| and there could have been a couple of different meetings for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| The only reason I bring it up is not because we will not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| We have our two meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| and I just want to make public attention to the fact that local groups in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| may want to establish meetings and wish to consider the candidates and form an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| As you're looking at me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| would you like me to contact the League of Women Voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| and see if they would be interested in hosting a public forum for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| That's entirely up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| Commission is not requesting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| It should be coming from the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| It should, but I know that Dr. Briggs is very busy right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| and may not have the time to put that together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| and the League would be a good second option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| So I'll ask them if they'd be willing to do that unless there are any objections from anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| I agree that it should come from the 5th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| but it might not be possible this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2274)|

| 0:38:46| Do you wish to pull that from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| I would like that question answered before I vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2329)|
| 0:38:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| Item on Page 4, R14-12-201, is removed from consent by Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2337)|
| 0:39:08| Now then, as I had said a moment ago, all that to be added, removed, and withdrawn, deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2348)|
| 0:39:16| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| And without objection, I move the ordinance on the Audit Committee to the first order of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2362)|

| 0:41:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| Motion and second is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| Chris Caldwell, Mr. Elmore, please give your names and addresses for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2507)|
| 0:42:00| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| I'm going to turn it over to Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| Mr. Elmore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| Larry Elmore, 1634 Wembley Hill Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2529)|
| 0:42:15| Also vice president of Pew CPAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| I'd first like to say that I was a member of the leadership Knoxville class that Dr. Briggs graduated from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| and I was in the meeting when he decided to go into politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| He started this leadership Knoxville training class with no intention at all of going into politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2552)|
| 0:42:39| About the middle of the way through the year, he stood up one day and said he had decided to go into politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2559)|
| 0:42:46| So he's a good man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| The reason I'm here today is I made some comments to the audit committee in their last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| about the ordinance that you're going to vote on today on internal audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2577)|
| 0:43:04| And my purpose of those comments was to stress from the perspective of the external audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| which is a whole different perspective than the internal audit department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| our intent or our purpose is to opine on the fairness of your financial statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| Now, in the process of doing that, we evaluate your controls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| and we evaluate your things that go on during the year that may affect the financials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| But alternatively, the internal auditor's purpose is to look at operational type things, internal operating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2609)|
| 0:43:37| internal controls specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| So the way that department is set up affects us to a large degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| because we many times try to rely on what the internal auditor does in doing our work for the external audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2627)|
| 0:43:55| So the more things that they do that we can rely on, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| The better for us because it cuts our work down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| The better for you because it holds your costs down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| So I feel very strongly that you should, in discussing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| and deciding what you're going to do on this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| feel very strongly that you should not tie the hands of the internal auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| and that you try to give them as much free reign as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| in deciding when, where, and how to go about their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| For example, I think the middle of September was when the discussion started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2669)|
| 0:44:36| about who was going to do the work in the schools related to the credit cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2676)|
| 0:44:44| Discussion went back and forth, back and forth from the audit committee to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| the audit committee to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| A lot of discussion, a lot of voting, a lot of putting it back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| We're in mid-December now, and it's not been more than a week to ten days ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| that that finally was decided that she could go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| and Andrea Addis could go ahead and pursue that and how to pursue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| So it kind of gives you an example of what happens if you get too many levels of authority involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| in what she can or cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| What I would suggest, just in setting up internal audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| is that the internal auditor, at the beginning of each year, submit a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2725)|
| 0:45:32| a plan that says, during the coming 12 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| I'm going to plan to do specific audits on these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| And those areas would be defined in that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| Between those priorities would be some time that could be allowed for other things that come up during the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2743)|
| 0:45:51| In other words, you don't want her time to be so full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| and complete that every day of every hour is tied up on a specific project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2754)|
| 0:46:01| Now, there's been a lot of discussion about who should give the internal auditor the authority to go off on other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2761)|
| 0:46:09| investigate other things, come up and look at things that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| Someone calls the hotline, gets turned over to her, she has to decide whether to pursue it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2773)|
| 0:46:20| If there's too many levels of authority involved in whether she can or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| you're going to take away the element of surprise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| and you're going to take away the fact that she should be proactive as opposed to reactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| So you don't want to slow that process down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| So, in other words, back to my plan, I think her plan should be submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| It should be accompanied by a risk assessment each year that involves every area of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2799)|
| 0:46:45| every department that says, here's my risk areas, here's where I'm going to focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| Any variances from that plan should be approved by going either to the audit committee first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2809)|
| 0:46:56| which I think would be the best, and get that approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| But things that come up that are unproven yet, things that come up that are turned in through a citizen report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2820)|
| 0:47:08| or a leak or something that just looks funny, a concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| should be able to be investigated by her on a preliminary basis without having to go get approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2834)|
| 0:47:21| If you require approval on everything that she wants to look into or go into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| it's just going to slow the whole thing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| The evidence is going to be cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| The trail is going to be cold, and it just messes everything up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| So the element of surprise is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2853)|
| 0:47:41| So anyway, I guess I'm just addressing commission and making a suggestion that as you consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2861)|
| 0:47:47| as you discuss this ordinance, that you consider all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| Thank you, Mr. A. Morton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| Please remain in place for just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| My fellow commissioners, what is technically before us for a starting point, let me read this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2875)|
| 0:48:03| so we can start our discussion from what's technically in front of us right now, reading from today's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2883)|
| 0:48:12| Now then, I have to preface it with a couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| Mr. Elmore is saying that the internal auditor, the county auditor, has two ways about going to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2895)|
| 0:48:24| One, we may have a plan for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| That is the plan for the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| The other fork in the road is to things that come to the fraud, waste, and abuse hotline, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2910)|
| 0:48:38| through any means that might come to the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| Now then, here's where the verbiage starts in the ordinance that we have before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2924)|
| 0:48:53| Should the county auditor receive any information which would give rise to the initiation of an audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2933)|
| 0:49:03| and the professional judgment of the county auditor, the county auditor has the authority to pursue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2943)|
| 0:49:13| and then there are three words here, assess, investigate, or commence an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2953)|
| 0:49:21| These are parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| Has the authority to pursue the issue and shall immediately inform the chairman of the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2966)|
| 0:49:33| and the chair of the audit committee, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| That's the verbiage that's before us, and it has only in my mind one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2977)|
| 0:49:43| I think we heard it in the audit committee, the word investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| Our county auditor is here in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| I believe the word investigate is not a word that should be there, and we should choose a different word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2992)|
| 0:49:58| She may come and opine to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| No, she's just going to smile at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| But that opens the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| So when you say notify, I guess, you know, my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3014)|
| 0:50:21| Immediately inform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| Inform, yeah, not even notify, inform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| Two questions for you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| You said that too many levels, and I agree with you, too many levels of approval is a hindrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3030)|
| 0:50:38| This would have no levels of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| Is that a dangerous situation for us to get into, in your professional opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| Just to cut to the chase, I think one of the concerns that some people have is that she would be sent off on witch hunts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3047)|
| 0:50:56| somebody turns in a report to look into things that maybe not have any merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3056)|
| 0:51:03| I think the key is you're going to have to rely on a certain amount of her professional judgment to make those decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3063)|
| 0:51:13| because if she has to come to a governing body to get everything approved before she can pursue it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| it's going to slow everything down to where it's not effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| Now, the word investigate, I think, is a very loose term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| I don't think investigate is a professional term that would be anything other than look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3084)|
| 0:51:34| And I think at the level that you're investigating a complaint or investigating a concern, that's not really an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3094)|
| 0:51:43| That's just looking into something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| And I went on to say in the audit committee meeting, and I don't know how much time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| you don't have the five-minute clock on me, so I guess I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| We've got an hourly clock on you, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| I think the long-term goal that you should have, the long-term three- to five-year goal you should have for internal audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3118)|
| 0:52:06| in that department is to have some software in place that they can use to evaluate things that are looked at every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3126)|
| 0:52:15| In other words, there should be exception reports that print out every day that show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| here's an outlier in the types of transactions that normally happen in this department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| This looks funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| Let's go look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| Let's question that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| I don't think the formal plan that's being submitted right now that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| here's what I'm going to do that tells the whole world what you're going to do every day is the way to go about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| because everybody has time to, if a particular department knows that in June we're going to do an audit on that department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3156)|
| 0:52:45| what do you think they're going to do between May and June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| Get ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| I agree with that, but I don't know if you've answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| Should there be a level of approval for those things that pop up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3175)|
| 0:53:03| Or if not approval, should there be, by either one of these chairs, a veto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| If the chair of the audit committee or the chair of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| I would just think, if I'm professional, that there would be some checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| This, to me, seems the way it was read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| It's, I can move forward, I'm just telling you that I'm moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| So is that a good place to be in the long term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| I think if you're talking about an audit, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| If she's going to go do an audit that's a project, an area of, but if she's just noticed, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3213)|
| 0:53:42| that someone in a particular department is, I don't know, I can't think of a good example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3222)|
| 0:53:49| but if she just notices something going on that just doesn't look right, doesn't smell right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| she shouldn't have to call the audit committee chairman to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| is it okay if I go look at some disbursements in the trustee's office this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| and see if there's anything out of line in their travel and entertainment budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| That shouldn't have to get any kind of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| However, if she says, okay, I want to do a three-week look-see in the trustee's office for a particular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3249)|
| 0:54:17| sure, it should be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| Okay, so then should we put, I like what you just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| so should we put, but it sounds like from what we just read, the ordinance, that second hook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| say there's smoke and I've gone to whatever office and started, should there be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3269)|
| 0:54:36| I think what I hear you saying is at some level, okay, it seems like there's a flame here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| then I'll need to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| Yeah, but if you're that guy that she's coming to and asking for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| you're going to ask a few questions like, well, what do you know, what have you found, what have you seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| So she's got to do a little bit of front-end work to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| Yeah, I agree with that, but I don't know if our ordinance reads that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| Now then, having said that, you're asking me to read some relevant term again out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| The county auditor has the authority to pursue the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3305)|
| 0:55:11| and shall immediately inform the chairman of the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| and the chairman of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| Okay, now that's just a smoke thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| I'm going to someone's office and do some investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| I believe in our chain of command, the county auditor works for county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3327)|
| 0:55:35| and if there's not enough smoke, she could be held in check until we found if there was enough smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3335)|
| 0:55:44| Now I'm just talking to you in terms of conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| So I guess my, I'll pull back to this school thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3348)|
| 0:55:54| We got a letter asking for an audit, right, or asking the internal auditor to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3354)|
| 0:56:03| And so I'm trying to understand how would we respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| That could have come in via, you know, a hotline or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| So she should, in this particular case, start the investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| and determine whether an audit is needed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3377)|
| 0:56:24| I guess I'm trying to get to a point before we go through with an audit that there is approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| And that's how this whole thing started, I think, when we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| who can tell our internal auditor to conduct an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| And so if this ordinance doesn't change our processes, then I guess I'm okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| But if it's creating a different avenue to get an audit done, I'm not in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3402)|
| 0:56:50| And it sounds like from a professional, but I think I heard him saying he's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| investigate whatever word we want to throw out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| Those are fine, but audits need to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| If I'm not mistaken, I haven't read that in the last ten minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| but I think the spirit of that is if she's going to do an audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3428)|
| 0:57:15| not if she's just going to go look into something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| The purpose of this has the authority to pursue the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3439)|
| 0:57:27| I hope I've read the pertinent term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| Has the authority to pursue the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| I don't think you ought to have to have approval to go pursue every issue that comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| And that's actually what I think this is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| She has authority to pursue, investigate, whatever, just by telling the chairs of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3459)|
| 0:57:47| and audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| It doesn't stop her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| Yes, it does stop her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| The chair of commission, the reason she's notifying the chair of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| or the chair of the audit committee is to be stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| There's no reason to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| I don't see anything in notified that says stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| Could you read that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| Yes, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| Read it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| The county auditor has the authority to pursue the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| and shall immediately inform the chairman of the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| and the chair of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| So I guess I'll look to the law department at that point to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| I would think a notification is not a stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| I'm letting you know what I'm going to do and continuing, which I'm in favor of, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| But I'll ask the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| What's wrong with the sentence we had in before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| Before I've asked the legal department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| Right now there's probably some vagueness to the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| You all need to define what you're meaning by notice because you all, what I'm hearing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3531)|
| 0:58:58| there's not an agreement to what notice means and what the effect of being notified results in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| And so you need to provide some clarity as to what the intent of the ordinance means to the auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| so there's no ambiguity for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| If you're saying that she can investigate it and do it, you know, as Mr. Elmore has presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| then we need to probably state it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| And then if it's going to lead to a full-blown, and I'm not an auditor for your words, Larry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3562)|
| 0:59:29| but some level above a cursory or initial investigation, then you may need to get permission or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3569)|
| 0:59:38| I would say if it led to, if it was more than just pure investigative inquiry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3578)|
| 0:59:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| Investigative inquiry would just be, I'm going to go look into this matter, get some questions answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| I'm going to go down and ask the person in charge of that department a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| I'm going to pull out, and based on what I found out, if I want to go do a full audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| I'll go back to the audit committee or commission to get approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| Now, that's another question that was discussed in audit committee was whether that approval should be from audit committee or commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3603)|
| 1:00:12| If you read the audit committee's charter, I think it says that the internal auditor is supervised, monitored, I forget what the wording is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3612)|
| 1:00:29| but the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| I think commission names audit committee, and audit committee is in charge of the internal auditor on an administrative basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3634)|
| 1:00:43| And this would be an administrative type thing, deciding what she audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3643)|
| 1:00:50| I'm in agreement with everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| Otherwise, what if she comes to the commission and gets approval to go do this audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3653)|
| 1:00:59| and the audit committee is sitting there saying, we didn't know anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| The audit committee has got three commissioners on it, so I assume that they'll be coordinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| She only has to go ask the chairman of the, she doesn't have to come to the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| She has to go to the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| I think that this sentence, this is me as an individual commissioner saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3677)|
| 1:01:23| I think that what is happening is that we're wanting to make sure that when the fraud, waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| and abuse hotline receives a valid tip, that the person answering the phone knows that if it goes to the internal auditor for review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3688)|
| 1:01:38| that the internal auditor can basically pick up a pad of paper and go begin to assess risk and possibly plan an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3698)|
| 1:01:52| But it's a two, well, this is a bad stool if it's just got two legs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3712)|
| 1:01:59| The other side of it is that, no, it's three-legged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| The county commission chair has to know about it, and the chair of the audit committee has to know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| Did you say both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| And I'm just reading from the verbiage that's here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| Moving the conversation on just a second, I'm a little bit out of order on letting people speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| Yeah, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| From my understanding, the reason this was brought forward was because to get the element of surprise to the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3746)|
| 1:02:34| But we didn't want to create, or I didn't want to see created, an inspector general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3754)|
| 1:02:41| someone that just kind of does what they want to and doesn't really have to report to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3761)|
| 1:02:48| The way I read this, and what I felt that the audit committee was trying to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| is that the chairman of the commission and the chairman of the audit committee has to approve her doing this for her to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3774)|
| 1:03:04| That way it's not right now, it takes three, four months before we can even do an audit on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3784)|
| 1:03:12| And if something breaks in September, here it is December, and we're finally approving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| And you're right, the element of surprise is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| So they've had three months to, and I'm not saying they have, but get their ducks in a row and do what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3800)|
| 1:03:28| And it's anybody that we audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3808)|
| 1:03:33| Yeah, that's just an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| It could be schools, it could be trustee, it could be anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| The thing is, is we've got to give her element of surprise without making it to where she is an inspector general type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3820)|
| 1:03:47| The way I read this, and maybe we need to put the wording in there so that it is very clear, that says they have to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3827)|
| 1:03:55| These two people have to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| If they say no, we don't think that there's enough there, then it's a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3838)|
| 1:04:05| And it's not my role as the external auditor to tell you how to set up your internal audit department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3845)|
| 1:04:13| That's not my role, that's not my job, that's not my responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| But I'm just advising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| I'm just saying if I were you, this is the way I would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| But I have to step back at some point and say this is Knox County's internal audit department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3862)|
| 1:04:29| I don't want to lose my independence in telling you how to set up your department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| And I agree with what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| Right now, there's probably five or six steps that she has to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| or whoever sits in that position has to go through to get approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| And this at least gives it a two-step process or a three-step process that we can kind of get some element of surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3884)|
| 1:04:53| It's not like the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| If they want to do one, they can just go in there and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| They don't have to get permission from their main boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| But it shouldn't require another whole month of waiting for the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| And I think that's right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| We don't have it set up to where there's conflicting laws really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3907)|
| 1:05:12| Her guidelines, what she has to go by, and what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| And right now, we need to have to where an emergency or something comes up that needs to be investigated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3916)|
| 1:05:24| or looked into, whatever word we want to use, that she can call the chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3924)|
| 1:05:31| whoever may sit in that seat and say, look, there's smoke here and I believe there's fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3931)|
| 1:05:39| And then he or she that's sitting in that chairman's seat can go, yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| And then after she's already started, then we can bring it to the full commission and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3944)|
| 1:05:50| look, this is what I did and this is why I did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| And we go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| But that's what I think this ordinance was intent was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| There will be times when possibly the internal auditor may want to do some look-see in an area without everybody knowing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3959)|
| 1:06:09| So she can come to the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| And I think given that, by notifying the chairman of both committees, she would be able to do that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3971)|
| 1:06:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| Without notifying the whole everybody out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| I mean, we have to keep it as public as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| But there's some element that we have to have surprise here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3988)|
| 1:06:35| I mean, I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| And if it means putting in here that she needs approval from both these chairmen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=3996)|
| 1:06:44| then if that's the language we need to inject, then we need to inject that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| I would say the more you stir a pot, the more it stinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| What came out of the audit committee was pretty darn simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4015)|
| 1:07:03| The bottom line was after she received the information, she notified both chairmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4023)|
| 1:07:10| Then this last sentence should be enough to take care of the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| Upon consensus of the internal auditor and the Knox County Commission chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| the auditor shall commence an audit within the scope defined by the professional parameters defined by the AICPA and the GAGAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4041)|
| 1:07:30| Now, this gives the chairman of the commission the freedom to cuss and discuss with the chairman of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4050)|
| 1:07:39| But bottom line is the internal auditor works for the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4059)|
| 1:07:45| and the chairman of the commission can give the auditor the authority to go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| That's pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| A couple of things come to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| It seems like we're trying to figure out the definition of an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| If an auditor does any work, are they doing some sort of an audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| And a couple of other things that come to my mind is I don't want any person to have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4085)|
| 1:08:12| to produce whatever without any checks and balances like Commissioner McKenzie was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4092)|
| 1:08:17| I'm a little uncomfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| And I also would like to add a third person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| If there's any notification, right now it's chairman of the commission and chairman of the audit committee, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4101)|
| 1:08:28| I would feel more comfortable if the law director was also on this, make you a three-legged stool there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4108)|
| 1:08:34| so that all three of those are in this notification process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| And possibly there's something like the auditor has 48 hours to assess any situation or any call that comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4119)|
| 1:08:45| and there's a time limit of 48 hours they have to notify these three people and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| hey, this is what I'm doing, or they don't notify them at all because after 48 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| the auditor says, it looks fine to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| I don't think there's a problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| And then one other thing we brought up, if the auditor works for a commission and they notify us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4140)|
| 1:09:08| then I think commission can stop them whenever we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| So I would be comfortable with maybe 48 hours, do an assessment of whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| but you have to let somebody know after 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| Commissioner Bessel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| We're in a situation right now that we shouldn't be in at all, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4165)|
| 1:09:30| And that's because we don't have certain things set in place right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4170)|
| 1:09:37| And what we need to do is set parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4177)|
| 1:09:44| Let me get this off with right here because I had something I was going to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4184)|
| 1:09:49| But we ought to have parameters set to where when the auditor goes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| because we're talking about disbursements right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| Disbursements were made wrongly, I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| or should be tested if they're making disbursements of our monies out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| And we ought to have some sort of guideline set up within these different departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| of how disbursements were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| We should have a program set up in the IT department where they can monitor these disbursements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| And when the disbursements fall outside, I guess what was suggested in the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| that we could monitor those disbursements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| If something doesn't look right, we can go right to it right then and find a problem out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| without somebody coming from outside telling us that there's something going on wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| We need somebody in the audit committee that can help Ms. Addis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| She's got two big elephants she's trying to corral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| She's the county government and the school board of disbursements that are large sums of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4243)|
| 1:10:51| And there's a lot of transactions going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| We probably need somebody that can, I guess what was suggested to us was PIN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| Well, you're talking about what I said in the audit committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| I was talking about PIN testing, which is penetration testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| PIN, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| That was when I was talking about the audit committee or internal auditor of the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| what you should be shooting for, what your long-term goals should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| and have at least one well-trained IT examiner on the internal audit staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4277)|
| 1:11:26| because that's where 90% of your issues are going to come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| And probably somebody that works, you know, another auditor that can work in that field under Ms. Addis out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4290)|
| 1:11:38| But what we've got to do right now is we've got to correct the problem of monitoring these large disbursements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4298)|
| 1:11:45| The number of disbursements we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| So the first thing we're trying to do is find out how we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| And my suggestion is, hey, let's cure the, let's treat the symptoms right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| and let's cure the illness later on with some guidelines that we give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4317)|
| 1:12:03| or Ms. Addis could give us of what parameters we need to set for each department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| and how the disbursements are to be made so we can monitor it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| Right now, I don't think we have anything set on how our disbursements are made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| and where they can report back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| So my suggestion is, is let's get rid of this problem right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| and make sure we don't have a future problem by getting some extra help in here in technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4341)|
| 1:12:27| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4347)|
| 1:12:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| One of the reasons there's so much concern about this is because the history we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4354)|
| 1:12:40| with our former internal auditor, and we didn't have the audit committee in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4360)|
| 1:12:46| and individual commissioners could send the internal auditor out basically to look into anything they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4366)|
| 1:12:52| And the internal auditor was often used for someone's political agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4372)|
| 1:13:00| rather than what they should have been used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| So that's part of where a lot of this excessive concern comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| And I'm not, frankly, sure it's excessive, but there are a couple of problems that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| with the way this is written that I think need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| The internal auditor is an employee of the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| but the county commission works through the audit committee to direct the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| It's not a five-step process to get an audit started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| Basically, the audit committee meets every other month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| and all the audit committee has to do is direct the internal auditor to start an audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| and that's how it gets started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| So if there is something that comes up unexpectedly or that needs to be handled right away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| it absolutely makes sense to let our internal auditor go ahead and pursue that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| without approval from the audit committee because of our extended meeting schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4428)|
| 1:13:55| However, one of the problems I have is where it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| any information which would give rise to the initiation of an audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| and the professional judgment of the county auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| the county auditor has the authority to pursue the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| When we were talking, having this conversation about smoke versus fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| the way that sounds to me is that the authority to pursue the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| after it's been mentioned, the initiation of an audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| it sounds to me like we're giving the IA the authority to go ahead and start an audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4461)|
| 1:14:27| when I think what everybody is talking about is that they just want the IA to have the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| and the freedom to check and see if there's truly smoke there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| I think that needs to be addressed so that that is a little more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| And also a notification is different than approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4481)|
| 1:14:46| and I do have a problem with the IA only informing the chairman of the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4486)|
| 1:14:54| and chairman of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| That needs to, I think, be changed to they inform them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| and the chair of those two bodies has the authority to put the brakes on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4501)|
| 1:15:07| if they feel like it's inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| And that's not only for best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| It's also for the protection of the IA because if a commissioner tries us in the IA out on a witch hunt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4513)|
| 1:15:22| we will be putting our IA in the position of having to turn that commissioner down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| and this is a person who holds a certain amount of power over this person and their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| whereas if it has to be approved through the chair of the audit committee or the chair of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4533)|
| 1:15:40| then that gives our internal auditor a certain amount of cover or protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4540)|
| 1:15:47| And I think that that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| I like the idea of also adding the law director to that list as a person who should be notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4552)|
| 1:15:59| Neither chair of either bodies is necessarily an attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4559)|
| 1:16:06| and I think having an attorney look over something is always in your best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4566)|
| 1:16:12| I also really like Bob's idea that the IA has a 48-hour limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4572)|
| 1:16:18| that the IA needs to, after 48 hours, go ahead and make these notifications and seek this approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| I think there's a great deal of merit in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| So those are the things that I would like to see changed where it says the authority to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4587)|
| 1:16:33| We clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| What exactly do we mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| And shall immediately inform the chairman of the county commission, the audit committee, and the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4598)|
| 1:16:44| and that one of those three also has the authority to veto whatever thing she or he is pursuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4604)|
| 1:16:59| I think those are the three things that need to be changed in order for me to be comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| And my understanding was that in the audit committee meeting and the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| that part of that had been decided upon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| and I don't know why it didn't wind up in the written ordinance somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| I think it probably went through two or three different writings before it got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4636)|
| 1:17:23| But those are the things that I think need to be changed before I could be comfortable with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| and that's more in line with what I think the audit committee had discussed at their meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4647)|
| 1:17:32| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| Let me interject a couple of points here, one in defense of Mr. Elmore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4653)|
| 1:17:39| I let this slide a second ago, and I see it came back to be a concern of his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4659)|
| 1:17:45| Our external auditor, the county auditor, has a dilemma, as he stands here facing and presenting to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4665)|
| 1:17:56| He cannot, now these are my words, not auditor words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| These are my words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4680)|
| 1:18:01| He can't tell us what to do and then come back next year and see if we did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4681)|
| 1:18:07| He has to advise us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| He has to give us some sound advice about what he sees us doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4689)|
| 1:18:16| We have to come up with a program plan or paragraph here and implement it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4696)|
| 1:18:22| and then he can come back next year and tell us what a good job we've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| or what a poor job we've done as far as his expertise will allow him to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4706)|
| 1:18:35| The second point is that this is a county ordinance on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4715)|
| 1:18:43| so we've about read it 40 times here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| and we need to understand that we may not come to something that we agree upon today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4727)|
| 1:18:54| I believe Commissioner Brown pointed that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| We need to have something in front of us that we can move with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| but we may not have everything firmly implanted in the ordinances that we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4740)|
| 1:19:05| and we may have to spend more time at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| So this is a first reading of a two-reading ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| and now I'd like to recognize the law director to address a couple of three questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| that have been presented that he might like to comment on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4756)|
| 1:19:23| First off, I'd like to bring an understanding of really the function as it exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4763)|
| 1:19:29| what we really have on our plate before we even get to this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| because I think there's been some lack of understanding of the power that is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4773)|
| 1:19:39| First off, the county commission does hire, and all that employment issues are true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| In fact, you do hire the internal auditor, and there's ways you get rid of the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| And this body does create and establish the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| And in so doing, you gave the audit committee very specific powers and duties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4794)|
| 1:20:00| and they were basically oversight and direction of all audit functions, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4800)|
| 1:20:06| Not this body, that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| Also, they have the power to oversee all audit activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4808)|
| 1:20:14| Not this body, that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| That was the separation of powers you created because, as Commissioner Royals brought up, the whole history of why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4817)|
| 1:20:24| That removed commission directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| Now, from the law director's perspective, and this is just a personal observation to add to the mix, there are times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4827)|
| 1:20:37| and we have seen them in this government, and Mr. Elmore has been part of those times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| whereby we needed auditors, and we needed them yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| And they have come in in the middle of the night to close books, set books, reorganize, I mean, get things in order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4846)|
| 1:20:53| so that potential criminal investigations, potential whatever it is, issues, and we, as a government, don't have time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4853)|
| 1:21:03| and neither did he need permission to come in and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| And we all know of that history and issues where Mr. Elmore's firm has come in on behalf of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4867)|
| 1:21:13| and stopped the clock, if you will, and froze our books in a moment of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4873)|
| 1:21:18| and gave us and the lawyers and everybody else what we needed to know to properly represent Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4878)|
| 1:21:26| Now, all of the auditing functions of the internal auditor are to be coordinated through the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4886)|
| 1:21:34| That's the power you also have already given them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| I think the real question before this body is, and let me clarify the step on further down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4897)|
| 1:21:44| the auditor has certain professional responsibilities in these activities and auditing functions that she or he already has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4904)|
| 1:21:53| And I'm not so sure that what we're asking them to be able to do they cannot do already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4913)|
| 1:21:59| The thing that I see what I think this body is dealing with is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4919)|
| 1:22:08| If the auditor is doing an audit, then it may lead to something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| Well, that's to be coordinated through the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| It should never be bothered with this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| However, there are times when things specifically that has happened in the recent future should be brought to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4938)|
| 1:22:25| and then may be referred to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| That could happen directly and let the audit committee worry with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| Their request shouldn't be do an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| The request should be here are the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| Let's refer this to the audit committee and let the professionals decide whether you, as I would say, pursue the case or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4957)|
| 1:22:45| And I think that generally falls within the professional guidelines of being an auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4965)|
| 1:22:51| I mean, Mr. Elmore comes into my office and says, Bud, we need to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| We need to do this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| I'm pretty well listening to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| And, you know, I may send my investigator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| We may call an internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| We may call finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| But we need to get a snapshot of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| I think what you're asking for to make commission happy is does the chairman of the audit committee have the authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4988)|
| 1:23:16| because everything you've given is to the committee itself, have the authority to allow the pursuit of a full-blown audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=4996)|
| 1:23:28| I really personally believe professionally the auditor, if we got, as Mr. Elmore brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5008)|
| 1:23:35| if we got our software together and they can look and say, well, you know, money, this is an outlier right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5015)|
| 1:23:41| I need to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| There could be something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5022)|
| 1:23:43| There may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| That's their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| They should be able to, as part of their function, go look at that and say, oh, if they have a real heartburn over it, they may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5026)|
| 1:23:54| Now, here's the step I think you're wanting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| They may need to contact the chairman of the audit committee and say, do we proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5036)|
| 1:24:01| Here's what I found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| And they say yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5043)|
| 1:24:04| Then they can proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| Then when it's time for the audit committee to meet our auditors way down the road, they've got the facts they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5046)|
| 1:24:13| They coordinate it through the audit committee and you can get the formal stamp of approval or say we need to stop it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5053)|
| 1:24:21| I think that's the way the function was set up originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| I think you pretty well have that in place except for that interim piece if you want another check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5064)|
| 1:24:30| and balance which the auditor may feel more comfortable with rather than pursuing it independently until that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5070)|
| 1:24:37| That's what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| But right now, let me clarify what the law is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| The law is we have an audit committee whereby they have oversight in all direction of all audit functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| in Knox County Internal Auditor, period, that you've given them that power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| They also have the oversight of all audit activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| You've given them that power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| That's currently on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| The auditor has professional responsibility whereby they've taken oaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| and licensuring to do what they deem necessary as an auditor to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5100)|
| 1:25:06| That's already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| If you want this extra step somewhere in between of the audit meetings quarterly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| whereby there's more communication back that can come to the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5112)|
| 1:25:17| then I think that may be what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| But right now, I don't, I guess from a legal standpoint, I think it got convoluted somewhere along the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5121)|
| 1:25:28| that the auditor didn't have certain authorities and we need to be able to give them that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5128)|
| 1:25:34| This body is to refer issues to the audit committee as it relates to audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5134)|
| 1:25:40| The audit committee is in charge of all audit functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5140)|
| 1:25:44| And they can direct the auditor as they see fit and have oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5144)|
| 1:25:49| including her work papers and work product according to what is currently there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5149)|
| 1:25:55| So back to this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| The ordinance, I'm trying to put it in the context of the overall legal picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5157)|
| 1:26:04| is something to allow the auditor to pursue an audit once the smoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5164)|
| 1:26:12| I think she has the directions and authority to smell out the smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5172)|
| 1:26:17| But once that smoke looks like it's a fire, what I think you're asking is that she can call the, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5177)|
| 1:26:25| it would be the chairman of the audit committee and get interim permission until the full-blown audit committee meets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5185)|
| 1:26:32| And then she can come and develop where she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| And they can either say go ahead or kill it right then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| So it's outside the political process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| And I don't mind as the law director being involved when I need to be involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5201)|
| 1:26:46| but I'm not too sure I want to be a witness in the auditing process as far as our office is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5206)|
| 1:26:54| Anyway, I just wanted to share that with you so you'd know what powers you've already given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| and where you're really sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5218)|
| 1:26:59| And I think the auditor has some pretty strong power to do, as Mr. Elmore said, smell out the smoke already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5219)|
| 1:27:06| The question is, when does the audit begin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| And can we start an audit without having to have all these public hearings and put people on notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5228)|
| 1:27:14| If a phone call would do that, I think that's what this ordinance is trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| is give her the power to start a full-blown audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| I may be wrong, but that's what I'm trying to hear from everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| If you have any questions, I'll try to clarify all that rhetoric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| But I think I'm just going back to the time when we really needed auditors and they've been able to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5248)|
| 1:27:33| Mr. Elmore and his company have served Knox County like in the frigging middle of the night on issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5253)|
| 1:27:42| And our auditor needs to be able to respond accordingly, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| And if it means a phone call to the chairman, if that's what you all want to do to cover that deficit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5266)|
| 1:27:52| until a full-blown meeting can be made, then that may be what you're addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| I think we've got it way out there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5275)|
| 1:27:59| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5279)|
| 1:28:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| I think the element of an audit is the surprise, and I think we're tying their hands so much in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5282)|
| 1:28:11| of notifying so many people that it will be well known that there's going to be an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| Since I've been on commission, the audits that I have seen have been after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5296)|
| 1:28:21| The newspaper had it before we even started an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| That's not the way it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| There's no reason to do an audit after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| And, of course, an audit can be stopped at any time during the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| It's not a court of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| I support the resolution as Chairman Brown read it, and I think we should enact it on the first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5315)|
| 1:28:42| and move on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| Just for information, this is the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| We can change the verbiage before the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5331)|
| 1:28:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| As long as it's not substantively changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| To a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5339)|
| 1:29:00| And, again, I'm asking you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| You've been dancing around it all afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| Keep it simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| Keep it simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| Yeah, I agree with Bud that Shardie has the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5354)|
| 1:29:22| If what we're doing is saying Shardie has the authority to look into what she needs to look into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5362)|
| 1:29:27| and we're just giving her the authority to go ahead and begin an audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| then I don't think there's any reason for the words in the parentheses at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5371)|
| 1:29:37| But, again, I do think that she needs to go beyond, and I really like Bob's suggestion of the 48 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5377)|
| 1:29:46| because that puts an expectation of how long the IAs got to make those notifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| But there does need to be a check and a balance there to make sure that what's happened in the past doesn't happen again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5391)|
| 1:30:02| and to also provide some protection from our IA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| And right now we've got a fabulous chairman of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| We've got a fabulous chairman of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| We've got a fabulous internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| But we need to be thinking beyond what's going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5413)|
| 1:30:17| That certainly wasn't the case in the past, and it may not be the case in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5417)|
| 1:30:21| So just because everything is working wonderfully well right now with great people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5421)|
| 1:30:26| we need to write this ordinance or craft this ordinance so that it provides protection when that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5426)|
| 1:30:33| Commissioner Boyles, did I hear you offer an amendment to this to remove the assess, investigate, or commence an audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5433)|
| 1:30:42| Sure, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| We have before us an amendment to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5443)|
| 1:30:49| Read it again, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5449)|
| 1:30:50| That's what I'm getting ready to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| We have before us an amendment which would remove the parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5453)|
| 1:30:59| Parentheses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| The part in parentheses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5460)|
| 1:31:01| Assess, investigate, or commence an audit, and the section would read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5461)|
| 1:31:11| Let me read the entire thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| Should the county auditor receive any information which would give rise to the initiation of an audit in the professional judgment of the county auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5473)|
| 1:31:22| the county auditor has the authority to pursue the issue and shall immediately inform the chairman of the county commission and the chair of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5482)|
| 1:31:35| That is the amendment that is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| Did I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| Well, I guess you have to go back to your original makers and see if they accept that amendment, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5500)|
| 1:31:46| Well, I'm one of the original makers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5506)|
| 1:31:47| Okay, so who was second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5507)|
| 1:31:48| I'm on the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| The motion and second is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5511)|
| 1:32:04| First question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5524)|
| 1:32:05| The people that the individuals that made and seconded the motion, do they accept the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5525)|
| 1:32:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| Yes, yes, and yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| The alternative would be to vote on the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| Substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5542)|
| 1:32:23| The amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5543)|
| 1:32:24| On the what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5544)|
| 1:32:25| They have accepted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| Now I have read it once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5547)|
| 1:32:28| Should I read it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5548)|
| 1:32:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5549)|
| 1:32:30| Should the county auditor receive any information which would give rise to the initiation of an audit in the professional judgment of the county auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5550)|
| 1:32:39| the county auditor has the authority to pursue the issue and shall immediately inform the chairman of the county commission and the chairman of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5559)|
| 1:32:54| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| We're going to pause here for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| I'm going to ask for the advice of the external auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5581)|
| 1:33:05| Do you like the removal of that parenthesis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| Well, I don't remember what was in the parenthesis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| The words that were inside that, assess, investigate, or commence an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| So we're leaving pursue as opposed to all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5598)|
| 1:33:21| The pursue, the issue, is the black print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| The only suggestion I would make is instead of using the word would give rise, say could give rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5605)|
| 1:33:31| Because you don't know if it would or not until you investigate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| True.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| Any information which could give rise to the initiation as opposed to any information which would give rise to the initiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5616)|
| 1:33:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| I see a lot of nodding heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| Owen B seconded and Brown moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| Could we change that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| Any information which could give rise as opposed to any information which would give rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5645)|
| 1:34:18| The advice of external.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5658)|
| 1:34:23| This is in the motion as it now is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5663)|
| 1:34:30| Do I see other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| Is there any discussion about the last two phrases informed the chairman of the county commission and the chairman of the audit committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5672)|
| 1:34:45| Commissioner McKenzie, I think, was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| And I think this is something that we can clarify on second reading without substantial changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5687)|
| 1:34:55| But I would like a little more clarification on what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5695)|
| 1:34:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5699)|
| 1:35:00| We definitely need to discuss this in this same depth at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5700)|
| 1:35:07| Motion is properly before us and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| Do I see other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5710)|
| 1:35:13| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| I was just going to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| The audit committee is going to meet again before our next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| So it might be a good idea because I agree with Sam that there needs to be greater clarification there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5718)|
| 1:35:24| The audit committee can take a run at it before it comes back before us for second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5724)|
| 1:35:29| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| Commissioner Brown, are you okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| Since you're going to have an audit meeting, my biggest concern is not where we're at now, but where we could be at in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5737)|
| 1:35:44| What can we do to keep us from being in this same position two or three years down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5744)|
| 1:35:49| And maybe the audit committee could give us instructions and suggestions on how we're not to be sitting in this same position again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5749)|
| 1:35:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| And I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| I want to make sure I'm clear what Commissioner Brolls and Commissioner McKenzie are talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| I think if, and I'm not on the audit committee, so that's why I want to say this so they can take it back when they meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5766)|
| 1:36:12| The notification part does kind of bother me as well because you can say, well, I sent you an e-mail or I sent you a text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5772)|
| 1:36:19| You didn't get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5779)|
| 1:36:20| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5780)|
| 1:36:21| You know, there needs to be some clarification there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5781)|
| 1:36:22| I think, is that what you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5787)|
| 1:36:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| I think Commissioner Thomas just hit the nail on the head where I had a little issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| My clarification was the word inform and what does that really mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5793)|
| 1:36:38| The other thing, too, that I want you to be aware of what you're doing, which is totally your prerogative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| but you've gone to all the trouble to remove commission from the auditing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| And by inserting the chairman of commission, you're inserting commission into the audit committee again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| And you may want to consider what you're doing with that second informational piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5813)|
| 1:37:01| because everything is to be coordinated through the audit committee the way the current law exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| Everything is to be directed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| All functions are to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| All supervising roles are through that committee as you've created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| Therefore, it makes legal sense that if she needs to inform someone about a potential audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5834)|
| 1:37:22| it would be the chairman until the board can meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| So I'm just leaving that for you all to ponder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| But if we change that next month, that's not a significant change, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5849)|
| 1:37:33| Well, that might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| Is there a significant change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| If you're removing somebody out of the process and it's the chairman of commission, I'd say it'd be pretty significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5858)|
| 1:37:44| I'd agree that's significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| I would want to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| Well, you can address it if you want to read it in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| All I'm saying is currently right now you have a system where everything is coordinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| Everything has oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| Everything has direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| Everything has all of the responsibilities with the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| Now you're inserting county commission back into the process that is currently totally with the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5881)|
| 1:38:09| Not that you all can't at any time, you know, say call the chairman in, give a report, give direction, you know, do your thing from over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5889)|
| 1:38:19| But this is a day-to-day function decision you're making now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| This is a procedural every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| This could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| I'm not an auditor, but it could happen five, ten times a week where she could go and see things that needed to be discussed and a decision made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5906)|
| 1:38:36| And does county commission need to be a part of that equation or do you want to leave the oversight direction of the audit activities and function to where you have it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5916)|
| 1:38:45| That's the question I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| It looks like, guys, we need to have this discussion today about whether or not we want the county commission chair involved in that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5926)|
| 1:38:53| Or if we just want to leave it up to the chair of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| If you read the charter of the audit committee, it's pretty clear that, and it might be wise to give all the commissioners a copy of that charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5937)|
| 1:39:08| it's pretty clear what the responsibilities of that audit committee are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| And they are to, in the wording of Mr. Armstrong a while ago, supervise, direct, and lead the activities of the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5952)|
| 1:39:21| And let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| If the only thing the internal auditor does during the year is what was given to be approved in January as a formal planned program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5962)|
| 1:39:34| that's not a very effective internal auditor because they should be able to respond to this, what happened today, what happened next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5974)|
| 1:39:42| On a daily basis, they should be able to respond and move to certain things going on within the county that don't necessarily result in an audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5982)|
| 1:39:51| but they result in some investigative procedures, some looking into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| Then I'm going to ask that we amend it by removing the chair of the county commission from that sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=5997)|
| 1:40:02| I think legally that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| According to the charter of the audit committee, that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| And frankly, it makes sense because it removes a potential source of politicizing something that might be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6007)|
| 1:40:19| So I think it makes a great deal of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| So let's go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| The maker of the motion, do you accept this friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6023)|
| 1:40:28| Yes, but let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| I still think, I mean, it could be worded that she notified both, the auditor, in this case, she notified both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6032)|
| 1:40:46| and upon the consensus of the auditor and the chairman of the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6046)|
| 1:40:52| but I think that the chairman of the commission needs to be kept in the know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6052)|
| 1:40:59| He might not have, I mean, he's not making that decision, but he's in the know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6059)|
| 1:41:05| and I think the commission needs to know what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| I was actually going to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| That gets into that notification piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6075)|
| 1:41:16| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6076)|
| 1:41:17| You can tell them, text and email, in this case, he, but the approval process is between the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6077)|
| 1:41:24| That's already on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| You mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| So you accept the friendly amendment that the chair of Knox County Commission not be in that sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6089)|
| 1:41:36| It does place us in a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6098)|
| 1:41:39| No, I don't accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6099)|
| 1:41:40| It sounds like he wants to reword it to say, if I might speak for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| to say basically the chair of the audit committee is going to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6104)|
| 1:41:50| but you're going to notify the chair of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| You're going to tell, whatever word you want to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| How many amendments can you back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| On the advice from the law director, that can be the way the motion is worded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6117)|
| 1:42:05| The second, except that is an amendment that the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| And I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| Now, what do we take it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| Because county commission chair will know, but it's the audit committee chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| And it says it right here, they will be informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6139)|
| 1:42:22| So he's not heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| We're not getting approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6144)|
| 1:42:25| They're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| I don't think we need to take the chairman out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| It says we're going to have four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| It's not going to be taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| It's going to be informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6153)|
| 1:42:34| But the there needs to be then a different word used with the audit committee chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6154)|
| 1:42:39| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6160)|
| 1:42:41| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| And it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| Law director is going to work on what that word will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6165)|
| 1:42:46| So you'll come back with that with us next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6166)|
| 1:42:49| Well, I'm going to try to say what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| I think the motion said that the approval will be from the audit chair and the chair of commission will be informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6172)|
| 1:42:59| I think that's perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6179)|
| 1:43:00| I think you can leave that where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| It says immediately inform the chairman of the county commission and approval from chairman of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6182)|
| 1:43:08| That would be the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6188)|
| 1:43:09| You're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| He's not given approval, but he's going to be in the loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| The maker of the motion and the second are in agreement on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6193)|
| 1:43:17| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6197)|
| 1:43:18| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| Just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6199)|
| 1:43:20| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6200)|
| 1:43:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6201)|
| 1:43:22| I got a suggestion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6202)|
| 1:43:23| Listen, everybody on the audit committee is on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| I wouldn't want to be the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6209)|
| 1:43:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6210)|
| 1:43:31| I mean, they're representative on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| If I was the chairman of the audit committee, I would not want to have the sole power to stop an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6213)|
| 1:43:40| Because somebody I don't want to be accused of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| I think you have to second person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| It's the chairman and the vice chairman that are notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6225)|
| 1:43:50| Based on our setup, I don't think that if the chairman decided to stop one and the members disagreed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6230)|
| 1:44:01| they probably would have a new chairman the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| The motion that's before us agreed to by the maker of the motion and the second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6244)|
| 1:44:10| and this being first reading and with the agreement of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6250)|
| 1:44:17| Motion has been properly made and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6264)|
| 1:44:25| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6265)|
| 1:44:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| And this ordinance will be up for second reading at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6269)|
| 1:44:36| Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| We're going to pause for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| But what we're going to do first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6282)|
| 1:44:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6290)|
| 1:44:51| We're going to take a ten-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| It says 329.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| Now it says 330.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| So at 340, without objection, we're in recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6301)|
| 1:45:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| If everyone will take their place, we're now about ready to start the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6312)|

| 1:56:15| I believe it's by resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| not ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| but I believe by resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| of the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6980)|
| 1:56:21| the chair of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| is that delegated name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6983)|
| 1:56:25| and why it might not be listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| on their paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6987)|
| 1:56:29| we'll ask the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| if they can assist us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| in making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6993)|
| 1:56:34| that gets properly named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| And I just wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| that if that's the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6998)|
| 1:56:39| that we're being represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| at all these committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=7001)|
| 1:56:42| and the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=7002)|
| 1:56:45| And I will pass that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| concern through the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=7007)|

| 1:57:13| when I first came on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=7033)|

| 1:57:24| while they were at work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=7044)|
| 1:57:25| and we had a nice room set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=7045)|
| 1:57:27| and it was well received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| by city and county employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom141215?start=7049)|
