| 0:05:26| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=326)|

| 0:05:43| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| This particular location, has beer been sold there before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| It was previous owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| OK, has the license been turned in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| The application is for on-premises, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| Do you own this particular location, or are you renting it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| We own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| You own it, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| Does anyone else have in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| This is a corporation, National Fitness Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| Does anyone else other than the National Fitness Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| have an interest in this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| Who will actually be operating this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| It would be David Beardsley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| David Beardsley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| He's an employee of the corporation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| Are you familiar with the Knox County and Tennessee beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| laws and regulations, and do you agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| to conduct your business in conformity with these laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| Have you and or Mr. Beardsley, or the people working there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| have they completed their server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| They have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=407)|
| 0:06:47| We'll be starting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| OK, I'm going to ask the staff some questions now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| Health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| Fire marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| Sheriff's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| Can you bring your mic to you there, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| It's at the pool, outdoor pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| They have a concession stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| And my question is that I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| they can have glass bottles or anything there at the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=438)|
| 0:07:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| We don't have any glass bottles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| He swore that he was familiar with the laws and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| of the serving in conformity with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| And he would conduct his business accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| So Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| We have a motion, a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| Just curious, and I hear this existed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| and I'm hearing now that it's at the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| How's that going to look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| Is this going to be every day, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| kind of a general summer months, spring months, kind of a beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| We're open Memorial Day through, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| this year will be closed when Knox County goes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| But in the future, it'll be Memorial Day to Labor Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| It's seven days a week, which is 10 o'clock AM to 6 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| PM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=496)|
| 0:08:16| Do you do like a wristband kind of ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| Because pool people generally don't take driver's licenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| to pool or to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| So I'm just, again, as Commissioner Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| said, to keep you from coming back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| under adverse circumstances, how's that look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| As far as the beer sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| We've not really talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| We're going to have to come up with how we're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| I mean, right now, we'd follow normal policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| Every time they come up, they're going to have to bring their ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| We've talked about what you're talking about as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| as the band stuff, but we're not sure right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| how we're going to operate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| That does concern me at the pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| because you've got kids at the pool, probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| 70% kids versus 30% adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| So my question was, is it only at the pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| or in the restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| You don't have a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| It's just a snack bar type thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| Yeah, it's a concession stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| So it's just with the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| Concession stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| Commissioner McKenzie brought out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| you need to get some definite ID mechanism set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| And I like your idea of bring it with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| I mean, everybody takes a tote bag with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| when they go to the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| Certainly adults that would be buying the beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| and nothing to keep their ID in it, because to have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=585)|
| 0:09:55| around kids, it's going to take some monitoring too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| How many is too many for me, or you, or whoever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| So I would admonish you to be very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| careful in the administration of this product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| I would add on to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| I mean, yeah, you're in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| there where people can drown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| But what I didn't understand, I thought maybe it was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| like a snack bar, and you sat there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| But they can buy the beer in a cup and then walk away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| They could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| I mean, there's a snack bar there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| but there's nothing tying them in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| So they could go back to wherever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| they're sitting at their lounge chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| They just can't leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| They can't leave the fenced-in area with the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| All right, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| Yeah, I was out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| You've got to get the, once you turn in your training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| you'll get your beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=660)|
| 0:11:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=660)|
| 0:11:08| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=668)|
| 0:11:08| We didn't add the discussion item in regards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| to the Metropolitan Drug Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| and also trying to facilitate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| When Wolfie goes out and does a beer sting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| he takes money out of the vice operation fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| And he would like to, since we went up on our fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| and I don't disagree with going up on our fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| but I would like to allocate and have Bud draw up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| a resolution stating Wolfie's purchase cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=692)|
| 0:11:39| and be reimbursed through that fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| and also 20% go to the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| Does anybody else have anything to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| I thought you said 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| Well, 20 or 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| We can adjust that as we get the, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| it's unbudgeted money is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| I know that being on the Metropolitan Drug Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| that they're doing a tremendous amount of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| through the schools and teens and all this kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| And we talked about this once before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| We never did do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| So I would like to make a motion that we pay Wolfie's expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| and then 25% of the fine goes for the prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| through the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| And with the caveat that Wolfie can't purchase a case of beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| it just has to be six packs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| That's the Bud Lights, Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| You've got to be up to 21 to make a smackdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| There's no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| So in other words, what you're saying is 25% would go towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| the purchases or towards the purchases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| No, 25% goes to the Metropolitan Drug Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| and Wolfie's given back his expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| which is the retail, whatever he pays for the beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| no cost of personnel or anything, just the product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| And then the balance goes to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| No caseloads or kegs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| Commissioner Oldman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| I'm just curious out of a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| What happens to the beer that's purchased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| We can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| Just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| No, it's held in evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| Held in evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| It's my understanding that the Sheriff's Department supplies him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| with his vehicles and the on-staff Sheriff people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| but he has to get people that are not on the Sheriff's payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| He has to pay them to do this process too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| Are we able to reimburse him for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| I think he uses jailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| Do you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| Some are civilians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| I mean, they're already employed by the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| Not always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| Do you pay them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Yeah, but that should be covered with this amendment, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| No, I was just thinking of the retail part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| I wasn't thinking about the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| I want to cover everything that the Sheriff's Department doesn't pick up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| because I'd like to see more of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Well, we can draw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| They get comp time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Let's not get into reimbursing employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| Let's just do whatever they purchase, the beer, the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| whatever they need to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| and we'll continue doing the employees with the comp time and in-house stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| What about employees that aren't employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| Well, there are actually some of them working juvenile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| and then we make sure that they get comp time back for that time that they spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| But where do they come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| This is the first time I ever heard a head of a department come in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| and not want to take money we're trying to give to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| Do we need to check J.J. out for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| No, it's because he's getting new vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| Oh, is that why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| Yeah, we'll trade that for cars, new cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| That's where the beer goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| It has to be liquidated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| Yeah, let's not go with reimbursement for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| Let's just do the standard things that we have a bill for that we purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| That he has a receipt for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| That makes it easier and cleaner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=919)|

| 0:20:47| resolution shall be presented to the family of Charles Ross. Be it further resolved that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage as provided by the Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| of Knox County, Tennessee, the Public Welfare requiring it. Is there a motion? Motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1255)|
| 0:21:02| approve. Second. We have a motion to second. Any discussion? All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| Any opposed? The ayes have it. Commissioner Schoonmaker. Thank you. I had the privilege| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| to serve on a Knox County board for five years before I had the opportunity to serve on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| Knox County Commission, but Mr. Ross's service to our community pales in comparison to his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| almost 30 years of being on a board representing the citizens of Knox County. And we have Linda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1283)|
| 0:21:32| Ross and Kelly Ross here today and also Dwight Vandervate and Bill to say a few words about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1292)|
| 0:21:40| Mr. Ross. Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker, Mr. Chairman, members of the body. The resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1300)|
| 0:21:49| does a nice job capturing Charlie Ross's skill in design and architecture. We saw a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| different side of him. We saw the people skills in the setting of the Board of Construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| Appeals and the first time I had the privilege was probably around 2010 and I attended a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1321)|
| 0:22:08| particularly contentious meeting and I remember leaving and asking both Roy Braden and Bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| Pierce who is with me here today, who was the gentleman that presided over that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| that was just artful. And they said, that is Charlie Ross. And Charlie Ross served not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| only as the longest serving chair of this body, he served as the only chair of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| body for 29 years. And as you know, these are sometimes difficult positions to populate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1350)|
| 0:22:36| Not everybody has the skill and aptitude to be on the Board of Construction Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| and these were difficult meetings. You would have both, frankly, county officials and fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1360)|
| 0:22:47| officials who had an interest in certain things duking it out with folks in the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| trades. And no matter who was speaking, whether it was one of our folks or somebody from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| construction trades, Mr. Ross had a gift. He had the ability to really ferret out what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| the true facts were and get to the heart of the argument and what was going to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| a safer community. So for those 29 years, I can tell you without hesitation that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| construction practices are better, our construction is safer and we owe a large debt of gratitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1394)|
| 0:23:22| to somebody that operated very quietly in the background for many years but did it very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1406)|
| 0:23:36| This is your chance. Well, on behalf of the Knox County Commission, we are very honored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| to present this to you in service of Charlie Ross. It was outstanding. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1421)|
| 0:23:57| We had somebody sign up for public forum and I don't know if they're here yet or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1437)|
| 0:24:17| Steve Rogers, are you here? You want to speak? We can do it now or at the end of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1457)|
| 0:24:26| we can do it. Steve Rogers, 3150 Washington Ridge Way, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1466)|
| 0:24:57| Good afternoon. Thank you for affording me the opportunity to speak today. I was able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1497)|
| 0:25:04| to attend the joint session of the School Board and County Commission meeting last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| which I assume is as arduous for you to go through as it is to attend just as a spectator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| so thank you for bearing with it. I am a school teacher with Knox County Schools, so I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| have some vested interests in the discussion. As a teacher, I'm a big fan of rhetoric and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| logic in the old school Greek sense of the words. Logical fallacy wrongs really untrue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| to me. I find that it clouds the argument. With that being said, here are some points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| that I heard discussed that I think need to be clarified so that all parties can better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| understand and therefore approach the discussion with the appropriate information informing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| everyone's opinions. First and above all, most importantly, schools are not businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1541)|
| 0:25:48| Period. There is no discussion of this. The running of schools is complex and requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| an insane amount of money. I get that, but that doesn't make it a business. I heard the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| pot brought up point brought up numerous times and it makes my blood boil. One of our commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| is very proud that he never once or only once had to shift the price point of his product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| after many successful years in the business community, but I have to ask, did you ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| have trouble selling a washing machine because it was dealing with addiction and domestic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| violence at home? Did you have a washer dryer that was having a hard time doing laundry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| because it hadn't eaten the night before? Did you have a blender that was terrified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| of dealing with adults because it had been abused? Or a refrigerator living out of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| car which you would have to admit limits its potential? When you were picking the appliances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| that you were going to offer in your store, did you pick the best quality appliances that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| you could offer to your customer base? Well, I don't get to do that. I teach every single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| kid that comes in through my doors. I don't reject them because the label is scratched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| I don't reject them because their wiring isn't completely hooked up. I don't reject them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| because a newer, flashier version came out. I teach them all. And if you'd rather look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| at the kids as employees instead of appliances, because the metaphor is kind of wearing out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| fine. I can't fire my kids. I can't fire my kids' parents. I can't fire poverty. I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1619)|
| 0:27:05| fire hunger. I can't fire generations of discrimination and unequal treatment. Schools don't pump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1625)|
| 0:27:11| out a product. We create citizens. We are not capital as teachers. We're miracle workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| And you wouldn't know by the way we're treated, but we have amazing teachers in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| whose students, parents, and colleagues vehemently support and defend them from all sorts of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| attacks. These teachers are paid less than their peers in surrounding counties. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| assaulted by privatization and business interests at the state and the national level. Let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| not pile on business philosophies that ignore the humanity of my students and my peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1654)|
| 0:27:40| We don't talk about our students that way. So when you guys do it in the meetings, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| a disservice to us. No matter how small the meeting, the way you talk about my students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| impacts the way you're going to make a decision that affects them. So I would appreciate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| if you would consider that aspect. Secondly, there's mentioning of test scores. I am tired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| of hearing about how America is failing compared to other countries. PISA or PISA, however| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| it's pronounced, P-I-S-A, scores are touted, shockingly enough, by business-affiliated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| reform groups as an example of American schools failing. Well, here's a fine bit of data analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| there. Take into account that they don't teach every kid and we do. Compare you with schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| that have less than 10% of their students in poverty and compare them to countries who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| have only 10% poverty rates for their children and guess who's on top? America. If you break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| it down by 10% to 25% poverty in American schools in countries that are 10% to 25% America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| comes out on top. It goes all the way down with the exception of a country that is actively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| being bombed currently. There's no one that has the level of poverty affecting their students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| in the developed world and it's not being taken into account. So a test score is only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| as good as the content that it's testing or it's only as good as the PR person spinning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| it. Teachers and their supporters are fighting these testing battles right now because our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| students deserve to be accurately assessed by professionals in the field of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| and the results of those tests need to not be used to sell a narrative by someone who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| is clearly looking to invest in anything but public education. When you guys are discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| test scores look at the validity of the test and get a real breakdown of the numbers. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| your professional responsibility. And this is my last point I promise. I don't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| transcript from last week but there was an absence of one word that really stuck out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| to me. Trust. I know last week wasn't a huge night for policy making because it's a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| informal and it's with the dinner part going on and it's mostly people just getting their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| sound bites but no one talked about a core issue between the two bodies. Trust. I like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1768)|
| 0:29:35| that there are Board of Education and County Commissioner meeting, Commissioner members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| of each district sitting down together and talking or at least a plan to do so. I love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| that idea. But the County Commission is kind of the elephant in the room, doesn't trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| our superintendent and it may be a very prevalent thing that's out there and you don't say it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1786)|
| 0:29:53| outright but it's there. You say things that indicate it, it just doesn't get flat out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| said. I get where you're coming from. It's not a unique opinion in the county but you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| have to work with them and if you won't come out and just say that there's a trust issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| you're not going to get honest two-way dialogue between the two bodies. So you have hang-ups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| for paying about things because you don't know if it's imperative for student growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| or if you think it's just something that's on his agenda. It needs to be talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| and that's one thing that has to happen before we can get that dialogue going. So thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| for your time. Does anybody have any questions? Mr. Rogers, thank you for coming. Appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| it. Anybody else for public forum that did not sign up? All right, we'll go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1826)|
| 0:30:33| move into the devotional time and Pledge of Allegiance and Commissioner Olinby has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1833)|
| 0:30:40| devotional. Thank you, Chairman. I'm going to read something from Mother Teresa. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1840)|
| 0:30:48| shown to me last month and I've come to read it every day to try to help guide us as me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1848)|
| 0:31:01| and hopefully to help guide everybody else when dealing with other people. People are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1861)|
| 0:31:09| often unreasonable and self-centered. Forgive them anyway. If you're a kind, people may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| accuse you of utter alternative motives. Be kind anyway. If you're honest, people may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1874)|
| 0:31:22| cheat you. Be honest anyway. If you find happiness, people may be jealous. Be happy anyway. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1882)|
| 0:31:31| good you do today may be forgotten tomorrow. Do good anyway. Give the world the best you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| have and it may never be enough. Give your best anyway. For you see, in the end, it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1897)|
| 0:31:44| between you and God. It has never been between you and them anyway. I'd like to pray now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1904)|
| 0:31:52| Thank you. Dear God, thank you for this day. Thank you for bringing us together. I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| that we can sit back and make decisions that are best for our community and our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1918)|
| 0:32:06| and that we respect other people's opinions and views, even if we may not agree, but that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| we hold each office and each position with respect as we guide ourselves through these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1932)|
| 0:32:20| days and the days to come. I thank you in Jesus Christ. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1940)|
| 0:32:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I apologize for everyone standing for just a moment, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1951)|
| 0:32:39| let me say something. Commissioner Owenby and I had a chance meeting Saturday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| We were at the Veterans Cemetery with a group of Boy Scouts placing flags at the tombstones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1965)|
| 0:32:53| of deceased veterans. It's a pretty important day for the both of us. Anyone who has previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1973)|
| 0:33:01| served or is currently serving in the Armed Forces, I'd like for you to join Jeff and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1981)|
| 0:33:09| I here at the podium for just a moment. Colonel Julian would be one. See, if I call you by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1989)|
| 0:33:16| name, you've got to come here. So whoever may have served in the Armed Forces or is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| currently serving, please join me here. Now then, what I've done is I've really got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2001)|
| 0:33:28| the one I wanted to hook for just a second. Come here. Come here. It's you, it's not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2008)|
| 0:33:35| This is Mike Steely, and where are we, Mike? We're at the most important place you should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2015)|
| 0:33:41| be today. I saw Mike yesterday at a Veterans Memorial Day celebration out toward Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2021)|
| 0:33:49| The thing of the day was to speak about small things. Everyone knows the important story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2029)|
| 0:33:59| about an uncle or a brother or a daddy or a mama or a sister or some family member that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2039)|
| 0:34:06| served in the military that did something heroic. That's not the opportunity of most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2046)|
| 0:34:14| veterans. The thing that we really need to know, understand, and realize is they stood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| in harm's way. Well, here's the funny story on Mike. He showed up, he had on a Coast Guard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| hat. Now that's not bad. A Coast Guard's okay. They're in the song. Coast Guard's okay. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2067)|
| 0:34:34| he had a Vietnam ribbon on it. Now, that's not a bad thing. But he had a Vietnam ribbon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2074)|
| 0:34:43| on it. Now, that then raised the question to me. I did not serve in Vietnam just during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| that era. And I asked about the Vietnam ribbon. He said, yep, I was in Vietnam. And I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2087)|
| 0:34:54| in the Coast Guard? He said, yeah. On a wooden boat? Yeah. Now, did anything significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2094)|
| 0:35:05| happen to him? Didn't have to ask that question. Because he had passed the test. He had been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| there. He stood in harm's way. He did his job. That's all that counts. That's all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| counts for anyone who's been a veteran. I just wanted to relay that story to you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| so that you realize on Memorial Day, it's not all the important things that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2124)|

| 0:35:36| every day with the blocks of our life. Now then, I'm going to ask the Colonel Julian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2136)|
| 0:35:45| to make sure that what I'm about to request is proper. By an act of Congress, I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| it appropriate that anyone that has served can render a hand salute when giving the Pledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2152)|
| 0:36:00| of Allegiance in civilian clothes. And he's added that little phrase and made that appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2160)|
| 0:36:10| So I say to the military veterans or servers, attention, hut! Present arms, joining the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=2170)|

| 0:51:45| We have a motion and a second. Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| I realize that this is going to be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| but I just feel like that part of the public is not aware of some of the things that have occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3112)|
| 0:52:00| over the last couple of months with the chair, which is Rebecca Landmeier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| taking, in my opinion, a little excess authority and putting things like the severance package for Donaldson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3125)|
| 0:52:15| in on the consent item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| And I'm not sure whether they read consent items there like we do here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| but at least the public out here has a chance, if they want to pull a consent item for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3141)|
| 0:52:29| they can, just like we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| And also in taking the liberty of hiring a replacement without going through proper channels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3153)|
| 0:52:44| I just think that she's not been acting in the best interest of Knox County as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3164)|
| 0:52:55| and I think that this public acknowledgment of that hopefully gets to her and that we can get things turned around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3175)|
| 0:53:04| I don't know whether she'll be elected chairman again this next term, but it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3184)|
| 0:53:12| I don't know, Mr. Law Director, since they operate under state statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3192)|
| 0:53:19| is there any way that the county and the city can control the term limit situation with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3199)|
| 0:53:25| or they can stay on there forever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3205)|
| 0:53:33| I believe that they are, I'm trying to think what your resolution said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| Reappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| I think they're reappointed. I think they are term limited by your resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| I think this is probably her last term, if I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| Forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| Two more? She has two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| When your resolution went into effect, it affected county appointees, even to these boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3232)|
| 0:53:58| Prior terms before that do not count into the formula, so she has, they will be term limited, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3238)|
| 0:54:06| to answer your question, but it's not in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| Well, the decisions made by that body, and we've been having some discussions on some of them lately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3249)|
| 0:54:15| at our zoning meetings, but affect all of the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| not just one or two that are sitting around the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| and I think they need to be open and above board just like we do them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| So, as I say, hopefully this information gets passed along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3268)|
| 0:54:35| All right, we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| One pass. Any discussion? All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| We are done. Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| 203, approving a sub-grant agreement with Achieve Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| in the amount of $40,000 for support of work to complete a student assessment inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| for August 30, 2015. No local match required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| Commissioner Busser?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| The reason why I wanted this pulled off, and just to say something about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| there are certain processes that we go through here on the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| that we are required to do certain things in a certain order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| and I understand that this one right here was already accepted and gone through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| and it had to go back before the school board to make legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| It had to go back and re-vote on it to make it legal before they could send it to us for a consent item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| And it sort of got me to a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| I wasn't going to say anything about it, but it's like running a red light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| and telling a policeman, well, I'll just back up and go back through the red light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| and wait until it changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| And I think when we're accepting grants and money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| it's got to go through the purpose that the school board has out there to approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3355)|
| 0:56:02| and then send it to us instead of accepting it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| and then send it to the school board for their approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| So I just thought it came out of order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| and I thought we needed to just know that it came out of order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| and it was sent to us in a roundabout way to make it even more legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| But we have to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| I know it's on a consent agenda and it has to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| I just wanted to make that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| It was out of order, and it wasn't done in the proper process of the way it was supposed to be handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| What does Knox County get for the $40,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| I know it's not coming out of our pocket, but what do we get for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| It comes out of the taxpayers' pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| Dr. Mike, do you want to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| I thought the jobs of the teachers and supervisors were assessment of student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3414)|
| 0:57:01| You know, we talked the other night about money and where it's going to come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| and how we're spending it, and I'll reiterate what I said the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3425)|
| 0:57:11| We didn't get in the position we are right now fund-wise overnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3431)|
| 0:57:16| and we're not going to get out of it overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| While this is not our money, is this not a process that cannot be done in-house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3439)|
| 0:57:27| What are we going to get out of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| Jim McIntyre, superintendent of schools, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| Commissioner Brown, it is indeed a grant of resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| so it's $40,000 that will be given to the Knox County schools by a chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| and I think it's a set of resources that's in support of some work that we need to do anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3463)|
| 0:57:52| With these dollars, we are supporting a comprehensive student assessment inventory and analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| and essentially we've had a lot of conversation about testing of students and assessments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3478)|
| 0:58:04| and this is for us to do some work to really take a hard look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| and to make sure that every assessment that we give to students in the Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| is either required by the state or federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| or it's valuable and useful to our teachers in informing instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3495)|
| 0:58:21| So I think it's a great opportunity for us to have some resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| to support a piece of work that we need to do anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| So it's nice that the grant-making aligns with our needs and with what we want to be able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3507)|
| 0:58:36| Does this assessment include current test scores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3516)|
| 0:58:44| So it's essentially an analysis of all of the assessments that we're giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3524)|
| 0:58:50| in the Knox County schools in all of our 90 schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| and to look at those to say what's required by the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| what's required by the state government, what are we saying we need to do as a district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| what are local schools doing, and in each classroom, what are we requiring in terms of assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| There's been a lot of talk about assessment of students and are we testing too much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| and this is really to take a look at the testing landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| and the assessment landscape across our school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| and to really take a hard look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| It's actually driven by a steering committee of educators, of teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| who will help us take a look at this work and make some recommendations to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| about where we need to go in the future in terms of assessments that we do in our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3563)|
| 0:59:28| Is this something that you do every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| We have not done it ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| I mean, we take a look at, generally speaking, what the assessment landscape looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| and certain tests are just required by the state or federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| But I think what this is allowing us to do is really take a deep look at each and every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| We're literally going to have some folks with the resources that are here go out to each school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| have conversations with teachers and principals about what happens at each individual school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3588)|
| 0:59:53| within our school system, and also just in terms of the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| and are there assessments that overlap or that we don't need to be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3598)|
| 1:00:05| and that we can not do in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| So I think it's a really positive piece of work that we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| and I think it's really important, and it's great to have the resources to help us do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| Well, you say it's going to be completed by August 30th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| and they're going to go talk to principals and teachers who are going to be out for the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| That's going to be a little difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| But maybe this is something that needed to be done some time back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| because from what I hear of preliminary reports that some of the test scores are down this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3630)|
| 1:00:38| Which preliminary reports are those, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| Math, to be specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| Some of the math scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| On what assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| I don't know what assessment you use. That's not my purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| I'm just wondering where that's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| We're trying to figure out, do you know what, in reference to what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3652)|
| 1:00:58| because it could be determined by school, by its test, by...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| Overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| I think, yeah, we're outside of the achieve thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| Dr. McIntyre, so this is an assessment of the assessments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| It is an inventory and analysis of our assessment, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| Does achieve provide any of the testing that's being assessed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| Achieve is not, to my understanding, a testing company, per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3682)|
| 1:01:26| They've done a lot of work around standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| In fact, they were instrumental in the Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| helping develop the American Diploma Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| which was also adopted here as the Tennessee Diploma Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| They have five board members, one of whom is Governor Bill Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| They're a very, I think, credible organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| They have some resources and some protocols and some tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3707)|
| 1:01:53| that we can use in this process if we wish to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| but really the design and the implementation of the inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| and analysis is our choice of how we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| They're just providing some resources and potential support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| Robert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| Yes, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| This right here, as I think Charlie and Commissioner Bussler said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3734)|
| 1:02:21| was one of two that were approved without going through school board first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| So current school board policy that was approved by the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| in previous years states that under certain circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| the superintendent of schools can accept grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| for example if they're under $50,000, on behalf of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| Now the law director has opined that that school board policy needs to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| to make it coincident with current state statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| but current board policy allows for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| So we've gone back and we're looking to remedy those situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| where it followed board policy, but apparently not the current state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3778)|
| 1:03:05| Okay, because it sounds like the current board policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| because the state statute always supersedes everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| So this one doesn't concern me as much because there's no funds matched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3796)|
| 1:03:23| It's the one that's going to be coming, I guess, to us next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| that has matching funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| It's kind of like what Mr. Bussler said, it's kind of like you rob a bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| but just because you get the money back doesn't mean you didn't rob the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| You know, you still robbed the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| And by approving that, we basically broke the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| The state statute says you have to get it approved by the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| and we can't just unilaterally approve contracts without their approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| So now we're trying to fix something that was already broken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| that we already violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| So a previous law director interpreted the law as to being able to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3838)|
| 1:04:05| that authority, the school board being able to delegate that authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| to the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| The current law director does not agree with that position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| and of course he's the authority at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| And so I believe the school board is working toward rectifying that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| Mr. Chairman, I believe what we have here is a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| between the commissioner and the superintendent of the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| and I'd like to ask the law director his opinion of the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| that's taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| First and foremost, number one, there is no other opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| There has never been an opinion written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| There is no opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| There's only one opinion on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| That's the current opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| That's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| What we have before us here is the school board has the opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| under law, to rectify any mistake that could have been legally done prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3896)|
| 1:05:03| The school board is trying to do that and has sent this over to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| and this particular one is under the agreement on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3907)|
| 1:05:13| And so it's my advice to this body to pass this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3913)|
| 1:05:19| and help the school board take care of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| that they're trying to deal with across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| This initial conversation, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| what Commissioner Bussler had to ask was fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| but if we're talking about people may disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| but we have an agreed order of consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| and we'll put these things on our consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| which means we don't discuss them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| So are we breaking the law right now as we discuss this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| I think we can throw words out there that are fairly inflammatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| that I don't think builds the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| or builds what this gentleman talked about during public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| that T word, trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| It's like we're playing gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| The law director came out with an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| The school board wasn't aware of the opinion or of the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3971)|
| 1:06:17| Now they're cleaning it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| We have this happen a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| We have resolutions come before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| one today for the senior citizen center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| They hadn't worked it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3986)|
| 1:06:27| If we looked at the words that's printed here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| that's not what we passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| I mean, we clean things up as they come before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| but this seems to be something, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| like we're trying to make something sinister out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| This isn't a sinister issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| The school board's going to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| Officially we're supposed to vote on it on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| We're not supposed to have this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| We agreed to have this conversation during the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| We're not even living up to the laws that we ourselves passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| They said we would have these conversations last week and not this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| So are we breaking the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| It's fine to have these, but I just wish we would, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| tone down the rhetoric and the choices of words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4023)|
| 1:07:08| I think it doesn't help, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| We have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| Commissioner Bussel had a very valid question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| The question was asked and it was answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| Now we're getting into other things, and it bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| Mr. Chairman, if I just may, I want to agree with the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| in that there is no other written opinion on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| He's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| And the school board is certainly going to comply with the opinion that's been provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| and adopt, or they plan to, I believe, adopt a revised policy in the coming months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4053)|
| 1:07:40| My statement was only to say that the law director's office had previously reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| and approved the policy as it's currently written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| and therefore I guess I made some assumptions about what the previous law directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| might have believed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| But he's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| There is no other opinion on this particular topic from a law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| I'm only going to speak on this one more time and then I'm through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| There is no record whatsoever that this policy has ever been reviewed by anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| other than the current Knox County Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| The current Knox County Law Director has given one opinion on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| that's the opinion that stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| I'm not going to discuss it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| Mr. Smith, do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| Mr. Bussel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| There was a mention made about, you know, where we do a consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| We always did it on the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| If there was a consent agenda and somebody wanted to pull it off before we really voted on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| we could do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| Is that not part of our policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| But on the education consent, if it's a contract or a grant or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| we usually just approve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| I don't think it's a commission rule, but what Sam was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| we agreed to do the discussion of education consent items on work sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4138)|
| 1:09:04| And so it should have been pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| If it's going to be pulled, it really should have been pulled last week to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| Mr. Chairman, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| Me and you out here, I'm still stumbling through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| But I just thought it was something that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| needed to be shown that there are certain things that needed to be go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| and we're voting on something that was rectified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| and just let everybody know where we stood on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| I'll ask Commissioner McKenzie to say that we've done that several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| Just one last comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| While we might agree with what's in a resolution or disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4180)|
| 1:09:48| everybody up here is a citizen of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| just like all those watching, listening, sitting down here, what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| and we have a right to know how and what our tax money is spent for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4195)|
| 1:10:02| Now, we might say, okay, we're going to pass it in our own mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| but I want to know what you're going to spend it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| Well, I think the discussion should have been done last week, not today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| So we're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4213)|

| 1:13:01| we have to have a public hearing on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4381)|

| 1:13:13| for the first two weeks, the 10th or the 11th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| the evening of Wednesday or Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4396)|

| 1:13:25| I've got a problem with the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| I've got a problem with the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| You've got a problem with the 10th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| What did you say, Jeff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| I'm not here, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| What time on the 10th or 11th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| I was thinking about 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| The 11th is great for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| 5.30 on the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| Joey, will you check on the room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| It's Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| It's Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| Is that practice day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| I can be here until 5.30 and 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| And so the only agenda will be just public discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| and commissioner discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| If we lose, I'll just blame it on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| I've been blamed before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| So we're going to set the 11th at 5.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| unless the room's not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4447)|

| 1:14:55| We'll try to make it one of those two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| It will be one of those two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| And we can use a small assembly if we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| I don't know that we're going to have a large crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| So we'll check on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| But we have a motion up right now for the vote for the 15th at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4506)|

| 1:16:17| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| Ten members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| Let's go ahead with the first item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| Request of the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| to adopt the 2015 Northwest City Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| which amends the previously adopted 2003 Northwest City Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| and the General Plan 2033, Commission Districts 6 and 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4602)|
| 1:16:43| I'd like to adopt the plan minus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| and I know that Mr. Welch and his staff have done a tremendous amount of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| but I don't feel comfortable with some of the stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| So I'm going to make a motion that we approve the plan minus any reference to Plan ET.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| We have a motion to say is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| This is a sector plan amendment, and because you've indicated a desire to change the language in the plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4624)|
| 1:17:17| this is one of those situations where it needs to go back to the Planning Commission for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| Before we vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| Before you can approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| I'll change my motion to refer it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| Well, in that situation, the Commission would be initiating a plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| that's different from the one that the Planning Commission has adopted and voted to initiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| So it would be the County Commission initiating a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| So the process would be my motion would be to initiate a plan amendment using this plan minus reference to Plan ET.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4665)|
| 1:17:54| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| Who's the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| Everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| Not everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| We don't even need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| Having read what people have sent to us and knowing that if we do not approve what was given us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4688)|
| 1:18:17| that means we're sending it back, not voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| The thing that I look for is Metropolitan Planning Commission to give us a sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4701)|
| 1:18:28| and that means it's their plan, not someone else's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4708)|
| 1:18:33| I think that's sort of playing in on its face that I look for something that Metropolitan Planning Commission is recommending for us to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4713)|
| 1:18:44| and it's MPC's plan and not someone else's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4724)|
| 1:18:49| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| Did the plan that MPC voted on, it differed from the plan that the city voted on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| The city made the compromise, or was the compromise also in the MPC plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4738)|
| 1:19:06| MPC may be better able to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| I'm under the understanding that the city council voted to adopt the plan that MPC certified to them with maybe one exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4749)|
| 1:19:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| Jeff Welch, Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| Metropolitan Planning Commission adopted a sector plan on a 13-to-1 vote with asking staff to remove the word plan as it relates to plan ET,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4762)|
| 1:19:34| and it said plan ET was a process that engaged a regional process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| When it came to city council, there was language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| After discussion of that, there was language offered by the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| and that was voted on by city council that stated, and it's in the plan that you have before you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4786)|
| 1:19:55| It's on page three of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| It states that no plan ET in its products are not part of or incorporated into the Knoxville-Knox County General Plan 2033 and its sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4797)|
| 1:20:07| It specifically states that in the plan that is before you, and I'll read that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4807)|
| 1:20:14| Note, plan ET and its products are not part of or incorporated into the Knoxville-Knox County General Plan 2033 and its sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4814)|
| 1:20:25| And that was language that we agreed upon at city council that agreed upon with individuals from the community that are here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4825)|
| 1:20:33| that came before city council and voiced support for that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| And we provided that information to you of the support that three individuals from the community came and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4838)|
| 1:20:44| we support that language, we support that clarification in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| So that was then approved by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| So the city council changed the sector plan, but we have to go back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4852)|
| 1:21:00| Well, I want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| The language that was offered as a compromise between planning commission and city council is not included in the plans before county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4864)|
| 1:21:14| It should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| It was replacement page three that we sent up to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| At least it should have been in our packet with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| So how did the planning commission vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4884)|
| 1:21:28| Planning commission voted to remove the word, any reference to plan ET as a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| and then city council added a clarifying note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| And again, that note was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| The clarifying note is not a part of the plan that's before county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4900)|
| 1:21:45| That was forwarded, as I understand it, it should be forwarded to you as part of that, of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4905)|
| 1:21:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4910)|
| 1:21:51| Was it voted on by the MPC to count the MPC commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| They vote on that addition prior to the city voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| No, they did not vote on that clarification note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| That note was offered up at the community meeting, at the city council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4922)|
| 1:22:08| So they're sending theirs back also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| No, they did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| They adopted it at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4931)|
| 1:22:12| It's on second reading tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| How can they adopt it without sending it back for MPC approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| The difference between what the city has done and what is going on here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4939)|
| 1:22:25| when the planning commission considered adoption of the sector plan, the question was raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4945)|
| 1:22:31| or at that point there was discussion about eliminating all references to plan ET,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4951)|
| 1:22:37| just like you're trying, just like the motion that you have made this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4957)|
| 1:22:44| They considered eliminating all references to plan ET.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| They decided not to eliminate references to plan ET.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| They eliminated references to plan ET as a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| and it was further clarified at city council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4976)|
| 1:23:00| just putting in there that it's not part of the sector plan or the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| In this particular case, they specifically considered or under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4985)|
| 1:23:12| took under consideration eliminating all references to plan ET and chose not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=4992)|
| 1:23:21| Are you done, Randy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5004)|
| 1:23:25| I guess this is for you, Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| The clarifying language that council added, city council added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5008)|
| 1:23:33| cannot be in this amendment before county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| because that language has not been certified by the planning commission to my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5016)|
| 1:23:43| It's my understanding from conversations we've had before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| that removing any reference to plan ET in no way changes the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5026)|
| 1:23:51| or the concept of the plan, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| Then what is the significant change here that we're worried about removing the language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| That was going to be my question to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| Why are we fighting so hard for this as an MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| I mean, is it a plan amendment change if we're not changing anything other than the language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| I mean, I do appreciate the work you guys have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| but if it doesn't change the plan, why are we fighting so hard for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| I mean, we're just stating the process that we went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| and the language that was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| We're defending the sector plan as a sector plan is a good planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| and we use plan ET and its background materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| as just general information for the whole planning process just to verify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| We just reference it as a resource that we used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| Commissioner Smith, your line is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| Commissioner Smith has asked why this amendment would need to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| On the reading of the statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| the county commission either has to vote to adopt the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| as it's been certified by the planning commission or initiate its own amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5102)|
| 1:25:08| The statute doesn't provide any middle ground as far as amending plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5108)|
| 1:25:13| that have been certified by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| The next applicable subsection reads that the planning commission can initiate its own plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5116)|
| 1:25:25| Where the commission wants to change the language of a plan, which the plan is language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5125)|
| 1:25:31| so when you change that language, the safest route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5131)|
| 1:25:36| the safest procedural route is to send it back to the planning commission for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| So if we send it back and they choose not to remove the language, we can't do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5141)|
| 1:25:47| I thought we were the governing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| So when the planning commission initiates a plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| it goes to the planning commission for 61 days, and they have to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| They can vote to approve it, recommend against it, or send it back with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5158)|
| 1:26:05| And then you have the authority to do exactly what the motion has asked to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| to initiate a plan amendment without any language in there that references plan ET.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| However, the planning commission could make additional recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| that you could consider at that time once the planning commission sends them back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5179)|
| 1:26:24| So they could send back up your motion without recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5184)|
| 1:26:29| and then another recommendation that you could consider as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5189)|
| 1:26:36| So once it goes back to them and comes back to us, then we can make a change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| Is that what you're saying, Dan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| Well, at that point you could adopt the plan that you initiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5201)|
| 1:26:47| or a plan that they've recommended, one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5212)|
| 1:26:53| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| It's not infrequent that we do change a recommendation coming from the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5216)|
| 1:27:04| They may want to rezone a piece of property, R4, and we say it's got to be R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5224)|
| 1:27:15| And the book stops here on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| Now, the question, and I think that Daniel was trying to bring up a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5238)|
| 1:27:24| and maybe it's been clarified now, that as we came into this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5244)|
| 1:27:29| we did not know that the language added by the city council had been vetted by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5249)|
| 1:27:39| Had it not been, then we would be voting on the original plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5259)|
| 1:27:44| that was submitted with all of that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| Right, Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| It's not been vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| It's not been vetted by MPC, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| Then we are voting on the original plan with all that stuff still in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5273)|
| 1:28:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| When you say, I guess all that stuff, there's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5282)|
| 1:28:07| I think you heard me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| I think I heard you correctly in saying that the original plan MPC brought to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5290)|
| 1:28:17| doesn't have Plan ET as a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| And all city council did was to satisfy the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5300)|
| 1:28:25| make an additional clarifying statement that they put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| But there's no intent change with the plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| The plan that was presented to the planning commission from the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5314)|
| 1:28:39| referred to Plan ET as a plan, if you want to call it that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5319)|
| 1:28:45| The planning commission in taking their action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| and didn't specifically say in paragraph one, page three, this, that, and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5328)|
| 1:28:53| They said in their adopting motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| they said remove references to Plan ET as a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5337)|
| 1:29:03| And that's how they adopted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| When it got to city council, council further clarified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| I don't think that they did anything that the planning commission wasn't doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| when they were saying that Plan ET is not part of the sector plan or part of the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5355)|
| 1:29:21| further clarifying the fact that it is not a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| And I think that's what the action between the planning commission and city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5365)|
| 1:29:32| Now, if you want to deal with this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5372)|
| 1:29:39| I think I understand what you're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| And if you want to send it back to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| we will certainly present your point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| or you can send a representative if you would like to present your point of view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5389)|
| 1:29:54| as to why all references to Plan ET should be eliminated from the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5394)|
| 1:30:00| It is your plan amendment and will be heard by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| The planning commission can incorporate your request into that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| or they can reject it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| But they will consider it, and then it will come back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| at which point you can adopt the plan as you see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5413)|
| 1:30:19| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| Mr. Kelly, just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| Was there not a MPC commissioner vote on some part of this plan where it was a 7-7 vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5423)|
| 1:30:31| Yes, that was a 7-7 vote to take out all references to Plan ET.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5431)|
| 1:30:37| So the motion failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| And at that point, they made the motion to strike the reference to Plan ET as a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5439)|
| 1:30:46| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| Call for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5450)|
| 1:30:51| Commissioner Bussell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| I'm reading on page three of this that came to council, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5454)|
| 1:30:59| the city mayor, which says one of the things they wanted to add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5459)|
| 1:31:04| it says Plan ET and its products are not part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| or incorporated into Knoxville-Knox County General Plan 2033 and its sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5467)|
| 1:31:16| If it's not that big a deal, why can't we just strike the thing Plan ET?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5476)|
| 1:31:22| I mean, that's all they're asking is just that term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| But if we leave it in there, it becomes part of the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5484)|
| 1:31:29| If you leave it in there in any kind of form, it's my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| it becomes part of the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5494)|
| 1:31:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| In order to maybe illustrate what I said earlier about I need a plan from MPC about Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5503)|
| 1:31:52| and when you read the wording that's in the caption, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5512)|
| 1:31:59| this is on Commission District 6 and 7, MPC action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5519)|
| 1:32:04| approved the 2015 Northwest City Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5524)|
| 1:32:12| and if that continued to say and recommend the Knox County Commission adopt the plan as amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5532)|
| 1:32:19| then I can vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| I could vote for what verbiage is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| But with that additional phrase in there, I'm conflicted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| and really the conflict is even greater when I hear our council talk about state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5549)|
| 1:32:38| and what happens when the legislative body receives a whatever you want to call this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5558)|
| 1:32:46| zoning request or the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5566)|
| 1:32:51| For tonight's meeting, I'm even further conflicted that I hear our council describing the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5571)|
| 1:33:00| and he's not the council for city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| and they may have taken a different approach to the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| which may be in conflict with what we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| So if they did it one way and we're thinking we should do it a different way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5594)|
| 1:33:22| I cannot vote for what's before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5602)|
| 1:33:28| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5612)|
| 1:33:33| So I think what I hear Commissioner Wright saying is we need to vote for what MPC brought to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5613)|
| 1:33:41| I don't think anyone in here wants to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| Exactly what I said was we're voting on what MPC brought to us, and I cannot support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5623)|
| 1:33:49| Right. I guess what I'm saying is what MPC brought to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| But I don't think people want that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| That's what I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5636)|
| 1:33:57| I think what you're saying is with the addition of the work plan, that underlying part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5637)|
| 1:34:04| that's basically what city council did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| I mean, MPC recommended a sector plan that had no reference to Plan E.T. as a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5646)|
| 1:34:16| That's what I think they requested, and city council just added on to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5656)|
| 1:34:24| So if that's the case, I could potentially do a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5664)|
| 1:34:32| that we just approve what MPC brought before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5672)|
| 1:34:41| I just don't know if that's what we really want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| I'm fine to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| I don't want to waste our time if that's not really what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| If really what you want to do is strike everything associated with Plan E.T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| because for whatever reason, then I think we just need to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| The dilly-dally with this isn't getting us anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| If that's what we want, I'm not going to support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| but that's what we as a body need to do and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5706)|
| 1:35:13| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5713)|
| 1:35:21| In regards to what Sam just said and the question I raised a few minutes ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5721)|
| 1:35:28| if you read what is on page 17 of our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5728)|
| 1:35:34| it says approve the 2015 Northwest City Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| as amended to remove the word plan in reference to Plan E.T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5738)|
| 1:35:43| and recommend Knox County Commission adopt a plan as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| I asked a while ago if it had been vetted by MPC and was told no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5747)|
| 1:35:52| This says to me that it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| So where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| The safest route for us to go at this point is what the chairman made the motion for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5757)|
| 1:36:04| It's going to come back here anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5764)|
| 1:36:09| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| I think when it went before council it used the word Plan E.T.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5772)|
| 1:36:17| and there was a compromise with some of the people in the audience tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| who went up before city council at that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| and they offered a compromise that worked out between the councilmen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| and these members from the community to drop part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| and that's what we're looking at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| And they were fighting as hard as they could to get the whole thing taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| I don't know anyone other than that I've heard from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| that wants Plan E.T. in this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| Now, if you have, you need to report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| but otherwise I think we need to remove those words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| send this back to the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| and let them work that out and send it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| Commissioner Boesel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| So right now we've got a plan in front of us from the MPC for 2033,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5823)|
| 1:37:09| and it has the word in there Plan E.T., correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5829)|
| 1:37:13| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5833)|
| 1:37:14| Okay, so that's part of the document one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| So we're either voting with the plan that's got E.T. on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5838)|
| 1:37:21| or we send it back for them to strike it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| In fairness to the folks that did come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| is there an opportunity for, say, Mr. Woodall to speak on what their position is now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5850)|
| 1:37:36| Yeah, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5856)|
| 1:37:37| Does anybody want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| Or Ms. Malone or Redmond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| Yeah, Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| I'll just speak to the process, okay, because I think it's very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5865)|
| 1:37:51| The amendment that came out of Metropolitan Planning Commission in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5871)|
| 1:37:58| was to remove the word plan in describing Plan E.T.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5878)|
| 1:38:03| but it is still called Plan E.T., Plan East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5883)|
| 1:38:08| But language had been in there that said the Plan E.T. regional plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5888)|
| 1:38:14| So now it's gone from a regional plan to a dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5894)|
| 1:38:19| It's no longer a regional plan that was produced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| So the amended version, Commissioner Brown, by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| does not include any of the language that city council came up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5909)|
| 1:38:35| that we came up with with city council and the mayor's office, as the compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| I'll call that the compromise, which is different from the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| that took place at MPC level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| The compromise leaves all the language in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5927)|
| 1:38:51| and includes one statement that makes clear that Plan E.T. is not incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5931)|
| 1:38:56| or part of the sector plan, whatever, it's that one statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| And there was some rearranging done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| so Plan E.T. went from the top of the list to the end of the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5941)|
| 1:39:07| But that's all it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| Mr. Whittle can speak to why there are problems, in our opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5950)|
| 1:39:16| with leaving Plan E.T. and any reference to it in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5956)|
| 1:39:24| And this is the first sector plan that includes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| There are other sector plans coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| We think it's a very important thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| and I would ask Mr. Whittle just to briefly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5970)|
| 1:39:38| I'm sorry, get your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| I'm Jack Whittle, and I'm a resident of 9520 Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5981)|
| 1:39:46| I live in the county, and I have been part of community forum for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5986)|
| 1:39:52| I think the commission understands the issue here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5992)|
| 1:39:57| and that is that the inclusion of Plan E.T. in the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=5997)|
| 1:40:01| and in the sector plan simply creates an enormous confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| between what should be the general plan and what it says when you put Plan E.T. in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6005)|
| 1:40:18| Plan E.T. is a very broad document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| and the amount of confusion that it will create down the road with what's in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6021)|
| 1:40:28| and how it affects the general plan is something that just doesn't need to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6028)|
| 1:40:33| I think what the commission wants to do with the recommendation of its attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| is to vote to change this plan to eliminate reference to Plan E.T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6039)|
| 1:40:48| and send it back to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| Once it gets back to the commission, the commission can make another recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6050)|
| 1:40:54| At the last time when this came up before them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| there was a 7-7 vote about whether or not Plan E.T. ought to be removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6056)|
| 1:41:02| and I think with this county commission's input that MPC will make a recommendation a second time about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6062)|
| 1:41:15| If that recommendation is different than what the commission wants to do about taking Plan E.T. out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6075)|
| 1:41:21| then at that point the commission can go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| And that's what we think is the best way to deal with the confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6084)|
| 1:41:35| that Plan E.T. simply causes by being incorporated into this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6095)|
| 1:41:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| Now for a third time I need to say that what's before us I cannot vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6106)|
| 1:41:54| I cannot approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| It needs to be sent back to MPC to remove references to Plan E.T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6116)|
| 1:42:05| That's what his motion does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6125)|
| 1:42:06| That's all my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6126)|
| 1:42:07| That's what I support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6127)|
| 1:42:08| If I may?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6128)|
| 1:42:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6129)|
| 1:42:10| Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6130)|
| 1:42:11| I offer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| I'm happy if you send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| What we want is the ultimate outcome is a validly adopted northwest sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6135)|
| 1:42:22| And if it takes sending it back to the planning commission to do it, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6142)|
| 1:42:27| We don't want there to ever be an issue as a cloud over this saying it wasn't adopted correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6147)|
| 1:42:34| So the action that you take today, that will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6157)|
| 1:42:38| Commissioner Skinner-Maker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| I just have another comment regarding the whole plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6160)|
| 1:42:43| Mr. Welch, I just want to make a comment to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| And I realize you were not in charge at the time that this was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| But it seems like when we do our sector plans and our general plans that these are our documents for the city of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6171)|
| 1:42:58| And we should be very proud of where we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| What really bothered me is on page 41 is you've got a color photo in the northwest city sector plan that references a plan ET concept drawing of a proposed community center in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6181)|
| 1:43:17| And this is supposed to be a northwest city of Knoxville plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| And then on the next page, page 42, you have a picture of neighborhood commercial, the Wildwood building in Olympia, Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6201)|
| 1:43:30| I'd invite you to come down to Choteau Road and see some of the neighborhood commercial in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6210)|
| 1:43:36| We've got neighborhood commercial all over this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| Why are we including photos from out of our jurisdiction in something that's our plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6219)|
| 1:43:46| I mean, again, this just really frustrates people that why would we even be doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6226)|
| 1:43:51| Because we have this already here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| And I realize you weren't in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6233)|
| 1:43:55| But I just want to make that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| The next time you guys do a sector plan, how about using local businesses and areas and things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6237)|
| 1:44:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6249)|
| 1:44:10| I'd like to call for the question and have Daniel confirm that the motion you made is the route that we're wanting to take to send it back to MPC to make the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6250)|
| 1:44:21| There's no need to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6261)|
| 1:44:22| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| It is a planning amendment, and once planning amendments are certified from the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6265)|
| 1:44:31| you either adopt the amendment by a majority vote to make the amendment operative or you initiate your own plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6271)|
| 1:44:39| In this case, you have moved to remove all reference to Plan ET from the document, and that changes the language of the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6279)|
| 1:44:52| And our reading of the law says that MPC should have an opportunity to give a recommendation about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6292)|
| 1:44:59| What the city has done is something different than what you all moved to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6299)|
| 1:45:06| The city left language about Plan ET in the amendment and added a clarifying sentence, from what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6306)|
| 1:45:13| And so that's something different than removing all that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6313)|
| 1:45:19| And so I think at this point, if you make the motion to adopt the motion, it goes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6319)|
| 1:45:25| Commissioner Burles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| Yes, I'm sorry. I apologize for being late. I just wanted to hear the entire motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6326)|
| 1:45:32| Oh, the motion is to refer the plan back to MPC and remove Plan ET from reference in the plan, all reference to Plan ET.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6332)|
| 1:45:43| Okay, and I'm fine with that, and I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| I like the whole Plan ET process, and I think that regional planning is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6347)|
| 1:45:54| But what we are focused on here is planning for our own communities and our own county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6354)|
| 1:46:00| But I do think that there is value in looking beyond what happens here when we look to make our own plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6360)|
| 1:46:09| I like seeing what other communities have done, looking at best practices and learning from other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6369)|
| 1:46:15| So I think that's important, and we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6375)|
| 1:46:20| But now that I know exactly what the motion is, I can support that. I'm absolutely fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6380)|
| 1:46:27| All right, the motion before us is to refer back to MPC, asking for no reference to Plan ET.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6387)|
| 1:46:33| Is there any question? All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6393)|

| 1:46:39| The ayes have it. Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6399)|
| 1:46:44| This is a side note. This is not the first thing that we've sent back to MPC that we didn't agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6404)|
| 1:46:51| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150526?start=6411)|
