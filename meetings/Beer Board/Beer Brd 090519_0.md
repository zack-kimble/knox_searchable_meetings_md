| 0:00:26| Could I get a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=26)|
| 0:00:30| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=30)|
| 0:00:32| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=32)|
| 0:00:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=35)|
| 0:00:37| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=37)|
| 0:00:39| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=39)|
| 0:00:48| Arthur Street Market and Deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=48)|
| 0:00:56| Could you give us your name and address, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=56)|
| 0:00:59| Mike Elliott, 234 Douglas Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=59)|
| 0:01:02| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=62)|
| 0:01:03| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=63)|
| 0:01:04| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| The file is complete, but I do want to call to your attention the H-1 zoning on this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=65)|
| 0:01:11| MPC advises us that a use-on-review is required for an on-premise beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=71)|
| 0:01:22| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=82)|
| 0:01:23| So, Chairman Hall, does that mean that we need to postpone hearing this until that use-on-review can take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=83)|
| 0:01:31| I'll defer that to Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=91)|
| 0:01:34| I suspected that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=94)|
| 0:01:37| You have an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=97)|
| 0:01:39| You can either defer this until they go through the use-on-review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| or you can, if you choose to do so, adopt it subject to final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=103)|
| 0:01:48| and the final documentation would be getting the use-on-review approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=108)|
| 0:01:53| And, of course, Ms. Martin would not issue the beer permit until that happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| and they had the appropriate use-on-review adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=117)|
| 0:02:00| So it's totally up to the beer board how they wish to pursue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=120)|
| 0:02:07| I'd be curious to hear from Councilman Woodhull since this is close to where he lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| Have you heard anything from the neighbors or any concerns about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| Well, just in trying to think about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| I haven't heard anything from anyone at Knox Heritage in regard to this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=143)|
| 0:02:29| But I'm wondering if it would be helpful for them to know if we are going to permit it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=149)|
| 0:02:36| and then if that would be of any benefit to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| and then we could take Mr. Swanson's recommendation of approving it pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=159)|
| 0:02:47| and then they would know whether or not a beer permit would be permitted on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=167)|
| 0:02:54| That's just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| I realize that there's the flip side of that coin, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| I was getting ready to argue the flip side of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| Which is, I mean, it does feel like this is a little more than a yes-no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=185)|
| 0:03:17| It is kind of a big deal of whether they can get this in under an H-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| and I think H-1 is a serious overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| So I'd be inclined to postpone and wait on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| Okay, that's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| Second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| How long are you postponing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| That would be a great question to ask Mr. Donaldson about how quickly that process could get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| That would be at least a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| Well, it would be at least a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| You know, I would hate for us to postpone it for two months and it get done quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| If it comes up, we can roll it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| So I'd be inclined to postpone one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| So we have a motion to postpone to the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=237)|
| 0:04:04| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| Yes, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| You're Mr. Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| Do you have any time restraints you're under, any business contracts or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| Do you have any deadlines on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| No, it's a profitability issue, I would say, would be my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| I think the sooner I can have it, the sooner I can be more profitable in my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=260)|
| 0:04:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| Were you aware of this situation prior to the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| You were not aware of the H-1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| I knew I was in H-1, but I had no understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| So you've made no contacts with MPC regarding the H-1 designation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=279)|
| 0:04:46| Didn't it go through MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| Didn't they have to clear it first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| I think isn't that part of the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| They confirmed for us what the zoning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| They just confirmed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| And so I would assume they did not know that you were coming before us with that until Ms. Martin or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=298)|
| 0:05:09| It would seem to be maybe a flaw in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| But whatever you decide is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| Mr. Swanson, is there any sort of precedence for this in H-1 of your recollection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| Recall any reason why this being in H-1 would be pertinent to the permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=323)|
| 0:05:30| Well, I know why being in H-1 is pertinent to the permit, because you have to have use on review authority to get a beer permit under H-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=330)|
| 0:05:41| But I do not recall an instance where this has come up in a beer board meeting before, which is not to say that it hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| It just says that I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| There's a lot of things I don't recall up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| Ms. Martin, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| Mr. Swanson, if the H-1, if the use on review is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=357)|
| 0:06:06| then I would assume there's no reason that this permit, there's no reason we would have to deny the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=366)|
| 0:06:14| I'm unaware of any reason to deny the permit unrelated to the use on review for H-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| Well, basically that's probably the reason that I recommended that we go ahead and approve it pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=379)|
| 0:06:28| But that's, as we said, the flip side of that coin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| Did you make that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| I did not make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| In fact, the contrary motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| So the motion before us is to postpone to the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| I just want to say I'm not going to vote for the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| What is pending anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| I'd like to hear that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| Otherwise, the file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| Well, I don't know what the relevance would be personally on the H-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| If somebody could help me with that, I'd be interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| The use on review, I understand, but why we wouldn't just pass it pending this, I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| I think I'll not vote for the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| Mr. Chairman, I'm like Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| I've been to the gentleman's establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| It's an addition to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| The community, I think, would welcome that establishment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| And I would like to see us vote to give the permit pending the final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=448)|
| 0:07:36| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| I guess just in answer to Mr. Bailey's question about what it means, I'm not sure what it means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| but it feels like H-1 is an important overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| and I'd hate to come back in a month and discover something was wrong that we missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| I mean, this just feels like if we do this, it prevents us from making a mistake that we could make otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=475)|
| 0:08:05| So it just feels safer to postpone to have all the facts in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| Councilman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| Not to debate it, but we have absolutely no position on whether or not it fits under H-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=493)|
| 0:08:24| That is out of our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| And he's before us, and I do understand something about profitability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| and I do understand something about the urgency that a business owner would have to have this heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| So, consequently, I have to agree with Councilman Bailey and Booker that I wouldn't approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=517)|
| 0:08:46| and pending the documentation, which is the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=526)|
| 0:08:54| Councilman Roddick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| I plan to support the postponement because I don't feel that I'm fully informed as to the intricacies of why this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=536)|
| 0:09:07| consideration of use on review is in our code under historic zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| and I don't sit on the historic zoning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| I've never sat on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| and I guess I would like to defer to them first to make that decision without an endorsement one way or the other from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=557)|
| 0:09:26| We are usually very flexible about calling special bill board meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| and should it come to our attention that the historic zoning commission has approved this use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| then I think it's very simple for us to hear this five minutes prior to a regular meeting, and we meet every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| So I plan to support the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| My mind may be blinking, but this has already been a market that sold beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=587)|
| 0:09:56| Someone probably said that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=596)|
| 0:10:03| It used to be J&J's, and it's had an H1 overlay since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=603)|
| 0:10:17| We don't have a prior beer permit at this location that we could identify, certainly not existing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=617)|
| 0:10:26| Well, I mean, I live in the community, and I know that they did sell beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| and Councilman Booker is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| It's a great addition to the neighborhood, and I'm not going to support the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=633)|
| 0:10:42| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| Let's call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=654)|

| 0:11:11| The motion fails to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| Do we have any other motions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| I would move to approve the request pending the final documentation regarding the H1 use-on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=677)|

| 0:11:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| May I mention something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| I've just gone through the zoning code with regard to H1 Historic Overlay District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=702)|
| 0:11:49| and I'll defer to Mr. Donaldson with regard to his beliefs that our use-on review is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=709)|
| 0:11:58| I do not see it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| What I see in there is a provision that says uses that are allowed are any uses that the underlying zone permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=720)|
| 0:12:07| So maybe it's there somewhere, and I'm just not seeing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| So the applicant may want to take a good look at that and discuss it with Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| The use-on review may be actually related to the C1 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| and I apologize if I've created confusion, if I misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=741)|
| 0:12:27| Well, if that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| We grant them in C1 pretty regularly without a use-on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| Just telling you what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| My motion may be out of order in that I indicated that it was pending the H1 consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=757)|
| 0:12:48| I think it's in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| He needs to discuss it with Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| but they just need to get together and look and see whether that use-on review is something that's really required or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=772)|
| 0:13:00| And maybe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| But get with the people at the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| and ask them to show you where it says you have to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=792)|

| 0:13:29| One of the applicants has not been in for processing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| so I'd like to propose postponing this to the next regularly scheduled billboard meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=814)|

| 0:15:24| We are waiting for the sales tax registration, certificate of zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=924)|
| 0:15:30| and final approval from the building inspector, task program certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=930)|
| 0:15:37| Councilman Rotem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Thank you, Chairman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| I noticed when I was going through this packet that the zoning was missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| Obviously, being on Chapman Highway, that's probably a given that it's appropriately zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| But the fact that the task certification is missing concerns me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| and I'd like to move to postpone this to the next regularly scheduled board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| until we can get more of that documentation in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=957)|

| 0:16:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| We have postponed you for a month until people take the task certification with the police department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=972)|
| 0:16:22| I think I already finished in the class last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| You what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| I did finish in the class last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| You didn't take it last month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| We understand from her that she took the class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| but she is not currently listed as a manager in the application we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| So we've informed her to come in and apply as a manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| and we'll be glad to bring that back to you with that paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| Do you understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1009)|

| 0:16:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| Mr. Chairman, doesn't the owner have to take it as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| Or do all the applicants have to have done task, or is it just one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| Just one of them that's on the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1020)|

| 0:17:25| Councilman Huq.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| He didn't bring a critter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| Well, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| I left it outside, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| It was a little big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| It wouldn't fit through the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| Although I did bring another one that I kind of misplaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1053)|

| 0:17:57| And this is our 21st Zoofari.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| And it's our biggest fundraiser of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| And it's one of the best parties in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| And everybody's invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1086)|

| 0:18:29| Oh, Boo at the Zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| It isn't listed on the permit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1111)|

| 0:20:30| I'll move approval pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| Counselor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| Yeah, I have a quick question about the note on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| It says the former beer permit was revoked by a hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| And I just want to make sure there's no connection between this company and the former beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| No connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| Officer Husky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| Do you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| I know of no connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| Sir, do you want to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| Never met him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| That's a good answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| So what about your employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| Are you employing anyone who was involved in the former beer permit revocation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1267)|
| 0:21:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| As of now, it's just I and the other co-owner, Jason Payne,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| and neither one of us had any involvement with anything there prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| Mr. Chairman, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| There is in the state code a provision that says when a beer permit has been revoked at a location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1290)|
| 0:21:38| that same location is not a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| It says when a beer permit has been revoked at a location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| that same location is not eligible for a beer permit for a year unless you as a beer board vote to waive that provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1304)|
| 0:21:55| Historically, we have consistently waived that provision as long as we've established that there is no connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| between the new proprietors of the establishment and the old proprietors of the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| The beer board has been very consistent in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| So if someone believes it to be appropriate to grant a beer permit in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| I would ask you first, please, to adopt a motion waiving the provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| that would otherwise require a year's prohibition of a beer permit at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1340)|
| 0:22:27| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| Yes, I would just like to tell you the reason that it was revoked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| we had several that we took before a hearing officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| basically for not paying some of their taxes is the reason why it wasn't as far as criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1355)|
| 0:22:42| As a seldom underage, it was for the tax purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| And some of those had already closed down anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| And I think this was the old Cali bar, I believe, and it was already closed anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1367)|
| 0:22:54| Councilwoman Pilar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| Is it necessary to sign an affidavit or something of that sort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| or can we just waive it based on his testimony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| His testimony will be on the record that he is not in any way connected with the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| I think that's adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| Well, then I'll move that we waive the requirement in the state code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| and waive the requirement of the wait for a year for this establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1399)|
| 0:23:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| Oh, Councilman Becker, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| Yeah, I'll support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| And I think what Officer Husky said is the key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| Actually, I did not know, Mr. Swanson, that there was a provision like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| And my sense is where we've got somebody who's overselling or selling to minors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1422)|
| 0:23:50| even if we end up punishing the property owner, I feel that's a serious violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| The failure to pay the taxes, not that I believe you should get away with not paying your taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| but revoking one for that really is a much different offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| So I think I can support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| Now we have to approve or disprove the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1461)|

| 0:25:49| Mr. Hall, you're listed in the wedding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| So are you actually getting married?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| My daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| Your daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| It was interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Under the application, your title is listed as manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| And I thought if you were getting married and getting me to the manager, I wanted some advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1560)|

| 0:26:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| We brought to you earlier Vegerama at 1204 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| And they haven't been able to meet their requirements in the allotted time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| And they're going to need another extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| And the applicant is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1593)|

| 0:26:42| But my landlord is trying to throw me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| And so I'm in a legal battle at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| And that's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1607)|

| 0:27:02| I move a 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| Chairman Hobbs, does that take us to the next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| It doesn't have to take us to the next board meeting, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| We just do 30 days at a time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| That's what we've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| It really doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| I mean, if she gets everything done tomorrow, she can pick up her permit if we grant it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1637)|
| 0:27:24| And the next meeting is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| But if the next meeting is 31 days away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| That was my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| But it's not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| It's been brought to my attention that sometimes we require people who are asking an extension to be present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1656)|
| 0:27:42| and sometimes they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| And the question was brought to me, and I don't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| Do they, when somebody is requesting an extension, do they have to make a personal appearance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1669)|
| 0:27:59| It's up to the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| You don't have to grant an extension, so you can have whatever requirements you wish to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| I know, but sometimes we grant extensions, the applicant is here, sometimes they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1686)|
| 0:28:12| That was a question that was brought to my attention, and I didn't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| It's not an issue that's critical to the legality of granting the extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| It's an issue of whether or not you want to hear directly from the permit applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1700)|
| 0:28:28| Yeah, I mean, I'd say I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| I think if these are extensions where we've granted a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| and somebody is just getting the final documentation together, I don't think they need to come see us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| It might be an interesting policy to say you don't have to be here for the first extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| but maybe on the second, third, it's showing up as a smart move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| I mean, that might be advice you could give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| I have a question on another issue, so you may want to close that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| I think we're done with that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| Do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Well, I'm embarrassed to admit this, but when the country inn and suites was considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1739)|
| 0:29:06| that was the second item on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| I evidently was taking a nap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| I don't recall the reason for the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| They haven't been in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| Oh, they have not been in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| Well, I knew they were opening, and so it surprised me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| And I'm sorry, I just didn't hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| Is there any other business that needs to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| I hear a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| What if we don't want to stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd090519?start=1774)|
