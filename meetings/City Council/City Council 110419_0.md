| 0:05:00| I guess they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| Well, the Boy Scouts are not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| He goes to the merit bench.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| That is all for the mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| We have reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| I'd just like to remind everyone we have a workshop on April 28th here in the large assembly room at 5 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| on the Ridge Top Hillside Slope Protection Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| So the public is welcome, and we invite everybody to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| Vice Mayor, could you give us sort of an update on the pension meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| Yes, I've been working with our counselor, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| We've identified a couple of people within the community we think would serve as good co-chairmen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=342)|
| 0:05:48| that would bring some expertise and financial knowledge and understanding of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=348)|
| 0:05:55| And we've been meeting with them, and we think we've got a couple of people identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| Once we do that, we plan to come to you, council, and talk about it, consult with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| and then move towards filling the full committee, which will be made up of the three employees groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| representatives, a retiree representative, a pension board representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| and then four individuals from the community that, you know, I've asked for your, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| for you, council members, to suggest people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| And so we'll continue to move forward filling those slots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| and all keeping in mind that we hope to wrap this thing up in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| So we think we've got a little bit more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| It's been a slow process, but we want to make sure we get the right people to get the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| and the issues out on the table and ultimately present a report or possibly a majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=402)|
| 0:06:49| and minority report that would be presented to the council, whichever council that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| whether it's this one or the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| And then they can then, again, discuss and have dialogue and debate over the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| and then ultimately make some decisions and vote on it or take no action or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=421)|
| 0:07:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=435)|

| 0:10:40| I went out and took a look at that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| That's a brick house, two-story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| It could be a nice house, but it's completely fallen into disrepair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| There's holes in the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| The windows are out of it, and it really needs some action soon to be saved and rehabbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| So I would move to approve or second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=655)|

| 0:10:59| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| If I could ask Ms. Wade a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| Ms. Wade, there's three of these in a row, 11C, D, and E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| And I guess my reaction is that we almost seem too patient letting these things drag on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| I'm not trying to criticize, but this first one was condemned since May of 2000 and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=672)|
| 0:11:20| constant efforts to try to get the homeowner to do something to rehabilitate them, to strengthen them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=680)|
| 0:11:28| And it looks like if we can, and I know it's always a function of budget and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| maybe we can move even a little faster on these because blighted properties affect the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=693)|
| 0:11:39| And so I hope that we'll be looking at that with an eye towards shoring up neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| by solving these problems even sooner than we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| So I want to thank you for doing what you're doing, but I hope you can speed it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| I will consider your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| I would like to point out that it was not certified blighted until March last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| Of course, that is a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| But we really don't take action to acquire properties until they're certified blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| So there is kind of a process we have to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| Vice Mayor Bacon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| I know in the past councils we've gone through the steps and processes that are taken by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| and the measures prior to moving to this condemnation, if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=744)|
| 0:12:31| And you might at some point, or if you're willing to hear it tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| some of the steps that we go through in trying to identify the owners and talk to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| and see, you know, bring them to see if they're going to do something with it before we take a measure like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=761)|
| 0:12:50| Well, on your agenda information sheet, there's a lot of bullet points there that kind of walks through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=770)|
| 0:12:57| exactly what's happened with this property that the city's been involved with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| from taking it to the Land Acquisition Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| And then prior to that, all the codes violations, taking it to the Better Building Board first to determine it blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=785)|
| 0:13:14| And then there's a notification process after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| We have to wait six months before we can certify it blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| So there are a lot of steps to protect the property owner from their property being acquired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=801)|
| 0:13:29| And unfortunately, that doesn't help the neighbors in the meantime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| But all those steps have to be gone through before we can acquire the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=812)|
| 0:13:39| And I appreciate the due process requirements as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| The last bullet point is the most telling to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| The neighborhood has made many complaints of drug use and sale in addition to prostitution at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| And due to its proximity to the Beaumont Elementary School, it's imperative that we remedy the blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| So, you know, again, if we can move quicker on these things, I think we snuff these problems out before the cancer spreads, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=836)|
| 0:14:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=843)|

| 0:17:04| Yes, Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| Vice Mayor Bailey and I discussed this about, you know, looking into our whole signage situation, and I think, is Rick Emmett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1025)|
| 0:17:16| I'd like for Rick to come up and just mention a little bit about what might happen in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1036)|
| 0:17:25| of us reviewing signs in terms of the entire ordinance and in terms of the situation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| what we have in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| And, Rick, if you'd share with Council what you were talking to me about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| Sure, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| Rick Emmett, downtown coordinator for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| We were talking earlier today about Market Square and some of the issues down there with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| And with the new downtown coordinator there, I'm hearing a lot of issues with things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| vinyl signs down there and the fact that folks are putting LCD TVs inside the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1068)|
| 0:17:55| and the windows and advertising there sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| And just the issues with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| And Dwayne and I talked about maybe convening some committee of the Market Square folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| all the folks associated with the signs, Ms. Cash and others, maybe Tom Reynolds, to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1085)|
| 0:18:12| to get all of our various documents, such as the Market Square policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1092)|
| 0:18:19| I've got my patio use agreement that may come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| Our sign ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| Get all those on the table, the historic zoning, and see all the places it talks about signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| and maybe try to get all those together and make sure we've got everything covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| Because people are taking advantage, certainly, of situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1112)|
| 0:18:39| You don't really think about it until you get to seeing what's going on up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| So this ought to help that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| Thank you, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| And I'd just like to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| We've talked a lot about signs over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| And I agree with Councilman Greaves and others that maybe we ought to totally review all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1135)|
| 0:19:02| And whereas we can't go back 50, 75 years ago and have a fresh, you know, if we'd started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1142)|
| 0:19:09| then and knowing what we know now, we probably wouldn't have a lot of the visual blight around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| in some of the signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| And we do have areas within the city limits that are truly scenic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| And then we have some areas that aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| And I think that we could take a look at where we have signs and where we currently don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| have signs and maybe have some overlays in some areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| And in return for that, where we do have, you know, I guess, scenic pollution, we might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1170)|
| 0:19:39| have some digital billboards and make some revisions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| And while we don't want to penalize current businesses for the signs they have, but over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| a period of time, maybe we could establish new standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| And when the old signs come down, the new signs would go up and they would look differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| And I think that there's some, most people would be in agreement that over a period of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| time, over the next 20 years or so, that we could make Knoxville look a lot better and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| not have some of the ugly signs and some of the, you know, the big high buckets of chickens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| 175 feet in the air and that kind of thing, that we could provide proper signage for businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1214)|
| 0:20:22| and at the same time make our city look a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| I'm for that and I would be happy to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| Councilman Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| I just wanted to echo a bit what the fellow councilmen have already said and as fast as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| technology is changing nowadays, you know, we have signage that we didn't think of even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| So, it's probably a time for a good review of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| We have one person signed up for public forum, Martha Olson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1248)|
| 0:20:56| Is she here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| Well, Ms. Olson is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| If Ms. Olson is not here, no further business to come before this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| We are now adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| Thank everyone for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1269)|
| 0:21:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110419?start=1277)|
