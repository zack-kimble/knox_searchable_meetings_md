| 0:01:17| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| At this time, I would like to call on Commissioner Bussler to lead us in this evening's devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=78)|
| 0:01:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=84)|
| 0:01:27| After all of what's going on around us here lately, I had to change something that I was going to speak to you all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=87)|
| 0:01:36| So I've taken what I'm going to do tonight out of the Book of Ephesians, where Paul was in jail, out of Chapter 5 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=96)|
| 0:01:44| Paul is writing a letter to the Ephesian church, and he expresses his concern about what's going on and what's happening to the people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=104)|
| 0:01:53| In Chapter 5, starting with Verse 15, he expresses this concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=113)|
| 0:02:02| And so I'm going to read Verse 15 through 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=122)|
| 0:02:10| First of all, he starts out with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=130)|
| 0:02:12| Wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=132)|
| 0:02:18| Be very careful how you live, not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=138)|
| 0:02:31| Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=151)|
| 0:02:38| Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=158)|
| 0:02:45| Instead, be filled with the Spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| Speak to one another with psalms, hymns, spiritual songs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=167)|
| 0:02:52| Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| And give thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=176)|
| 0:03:03| Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=183)|
| 0:03:09| What you have here is we are given many gifts from God, like friendship, respect, and unbound limitations if we use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=189)|
| 0:03:24| These gifts are not awarded or held tight, but we share with others what we can be accomplished through these gifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=204)|
| 0:03:37| When we look back at some of these things that he's written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| if we take care of Verse 21, instead of submit to one another, we use the term dedicate to one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=221)|
| 0:03:50| And out, instead of reverence, we use the word respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| So, what it seems like, we're losing those type of gifts that are given to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| And what do you get from sharing these gifts with others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=241)|
| 0:04:07| It is the knowledge and the gratification that you have made a positive impact on someone else's life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=247)|
| 0:04:17| And we, as commissioners, have that opportunity to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| So, let us pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| Almighty Father God, we come to you and ask for your guidance and leadership so we can use these gifts that you give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=262)|
| 0:04:30| And to know the joy of serving you and helping others to be all that they can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| As always, we pray all this stuff in your son's name, Jesus Christ. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| Thank you very much, Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| At this time, I'd like to call on Commissioner Smith to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| If you're able, please stand, face the flag, and give the proper salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=297)|
| 0:05:03| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=303)|

| 0:10:47| and whereas the commission wishes to commend Commissioner Daly for his tireless advocacy of litter prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=647)|
| 0:10:54| and control programs to protect and preserve the natural beauty of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| now therefore be it resolved by the commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| The Knox County Commission hereby honors Commissioner Carson Daly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| upon the occasion of his receipt of the Keep Knoxville Beautiful Felicia Award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| and applauds his dedication and hard work over the years in keeping our community clean by reducing litter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| I know it's highly unusual for us to honor a sitting commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| and I don't have to sit here and basically repeat everything that's in this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=695)|
| 0:11:42| but we all know that Commissioner Daly has not only talked the talk, but he's walked the walk on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| and he's done some really great things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| I am going to ask Conn, she's the executive director of Keep Knoxville Beautiful, to say a few words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| but I just wanted to honor Carson for this and tell him I appreciate the work he's done on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=716)|
| 0:12:05| Thank you for having me, and I just want to reiterate all the nice things that you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=725)|
| 0:12:12| Commissioner Daly, we are so fortunate to have you as our leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| You are fearless, and you're not afraid of dirty work, and you're not afraid of hard work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| whether it's going out there in all weathers, tackling laws, and trying to make a difference from the top down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=745)|
| 0:12:34| We truly appreciate your passion for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| There's a lot of work ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| The Tennessee River is one of the most polluted rivers in the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| and I don't think that that's going to be the case forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| because I do think that Knoxville really cares about our environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| and thank you for setting that example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| I feel like we have a lot of work ahead, and I'm excited to go on this adventure with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| and we're so fortunate to have him fighting this fight with people like me and our thousands of volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=784)|
| 0:13:12| You're just one of the many volunteers who are out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| and it's such a wholesome feeling to be out there with our community cleanups, and he's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=797)|
| 0:13:24| He's, you know, in his orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| He has his own litter picker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| He has his own vest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| So thank you for giving us this time to honor truly deserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| Carson, would you like to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| Yeah, I'd like to, first of all, I love, where'd she go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| I love KKB, one of my favorite, most favorite organizations in the world, no doubt about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=824)|
| 0:13:51| and anything I can do to help them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| Solid Waste, our Solid Waste Department is awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| They work really well together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| I was in court this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| We got our first case passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| It was a plea bargain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| They had to pay court costs, fines, and probably a little bit extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| It cost them probably $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| So we're starting all this hard work that we've done together as a commission to get these ordinances passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| It's starting to work, and if you've noticed, you see less We Buy Houses signs out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=859)|
| 0:14:27| You'll see less signs on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| That's because of our great Solid Waste Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| So I thank you for, Randy, I really thank you for this honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| You earned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=877)|
| 0:14:55| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| I know all of us have a deep appreciation for Commissioner Daley and what he does in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=896)|
| 0:15:04| Madam Clerk, Item 46 is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| Presentation of Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Report by President Mike Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| Good evening, Mr. Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| Good evening, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| Good evening, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| Mike Odom, Knoxville Chamber, 17 Market Square, 201 Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=918)|
| 0:15:26| In your package, your syllable is nice enough to put just the amended version of our Economic Conditions Outlook Report that we do every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=926)|
| 0:15:35| so that you guys can look over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| So if you have any questions from that, I'm happy to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| We at the Chamber, like the county, are on a July to June fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=940)|
| 0:15:47| so we are preparing in a couple days to start our new fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| So I just want to let you know, from our business plan this year, there's three main themes, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| The first being that growth for Knox County is good, and we want to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| We want to support the development of Advanced Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| We want to support the housing need that we have, the infrastructure needs that we have, and everything that goes along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=967)|
| 0:16:15| So that's going to be a big piece of our work this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| A second is something that I've talked to you all a lot about, and that is talent retention and attraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| So we have put a significant amount of our resources into that this year in trying to keep the talent that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=984)|
| 0:16:31| as well as go get some of it that we have had in the past and some that have never been here before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| So that's number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| And then the third piece that we're going to be working on is skills alignment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| and that is to really the folks that we have that either can be re-skilled or need to change a career, really get them those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1003)|
| 0:16:51| So that's working with KCS on the 865 Academies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| That is continuing our work with the American Job Center to produce meaningful, measurable results,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| and all the ancillary pieces that go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| So those are the big three things that we're going to be working on with three themes, if you will, this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| and I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| Thank you, Mr. Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Commissioner Jay, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| Mr. Odom, we've talked for well over a year now on labor workforce development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1036)|
| 0:17:26| and being able to make sure there's an ample supply of people to fill the jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| I was just looking at the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| There continues to be a healthy amount of jobs posted and low unemployment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| so there's plenty of opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| Are you hearing from some of the companies that have either expanded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| and were already located here or relocated here in the last few years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| Are they struggling at the same rate they were last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| Is it exacerbated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| I'm not sure we'll know all the data for years to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| but what's the kind of vibe along the industrial side of things especially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| which seems to be the hardest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| Industrial side is actually getting worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| The issue is, I think we talked about this last time I was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| is we actually have more jobs available than we have people to fill them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| and so we're seeing that kind of reconfiguration of positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| where people were making X amount of dollars before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| and now they're trying to get more dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| and the industrial side is starting to have to come up a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| and if there's anything else, it just takes a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| The more professional services side, they are having some better luck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| whether it be in compensation or, more importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| they're starting to get creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| We're seeing, for instance, companies that are hiring people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| who are thinking about career changes, mid-career changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| For instance, maybe they were in retail and going over into IT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| and then they're doing in-house training for that to get those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| So one great example is a company that you all helped us bring in, which is CGI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| and they have done a really nice job of taking mid-career changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| and getting them into the IT industry and have been very successful at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| Thank you, Commissioner Jay. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| Mr. Odom, I was just wondering, do you have any research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| or analysis or statistics on people that are living in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| working remotely for a company outside of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| I don't have them on me, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| We have looked at this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| and we can go back and absolutely update it to what's going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| If I'm not mistaken, and the data is about four or five years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| it was about a 60-40 mix, but I could be wrong on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| So it was about 60% came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| I think you misunderstood my question. I mean working remotely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| Oh, working remotely. I'm sorry. No, sir, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| You don't have anything on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| We don't. We've been trying to figure it out, and I'm not advocating for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| The easiest way to do that is through when you have a state income tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| so you can look at those records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| No, no, no. We don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| We won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| No, we won't. Hopefully we'll get that passed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| But, no, sir, we don't have a way to tell right now, fortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| All right. Census have any kind of information on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| No, sir. Actually, the vast majority of the census data is still way behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| So we've gotten the initial population and some of the demographic stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| but the real deep things have all been delayed again through as early as August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| but most of it is going to go into 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| Are there any further questions or comments for Mr. Odom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| Seeing none, thank you very much, sir, as always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| Thank you very much. Appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| At this time, we will move to our first segment of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| We do have three individuals that have signed up to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| and before we begin that, I would like to invite Mr. Chris Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| Administrator of Elections, to come and address Commission briefly on the upcoming election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1269)|
| 0:21:16| Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| Thank you very much, Chris Davis, 300 Main Street, Room 229.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| I am here today in my capacity as the Administrator of Elections for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| Chairman Beeler and Commissioners, thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| I will be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| There is an upcoming election which quite often gets overlooked on the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| This election is quite important because of the number of contests on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| and the number of offices which they represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| This election will consist of a state and federal primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| a county general election including judicial and school board races,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| the Town of Farragut municipal election, as well as judicial retention elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| All told, this is the most complicated ballot in an eight-year cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| and voters will have an opportunity when they go to the polls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| hopefully beginning July 15th for early voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| to vote on 58 to 61 different races on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| depending on where they live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| With 58 to 61 races on everyone's ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| you can imagine this will be quite long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| So long, in fact, that every voter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| for the first time since we've been doing paper ballots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| and this is election number six if you're counting at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| every voter will receive two pieces of paper when he or she goes to the polls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| with races on both sides of the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| So, in essence, they're going to have four sides of paper to be voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| This is a change for Knox County voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| As you have been receiving one piece of paper to vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| for this election they will receive two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| I just want to share that with you so you can help share that with your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| Just a couple other pieces of information real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| The deadline to register to vote for this election is July 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| a week from tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| Early voting begins Friday, June 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| This is a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| The actual election day will be on a Thursday, August 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| Normally it's on a Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| This is on a Thursday per state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| Early voting will be at ten locations across Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| Hours will generally be ten to six on weekdays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| and, in a change, ten a.m. to three p.m. on weekends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| meaning we're going to start a little earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| and close a little earlier on Saturdays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| because our research shows us that people really want to get in and vote in the mornings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| and those afternoons generally are pretty quiet, if not dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| Please note that there will be three Saturdays to vote in this upcoming election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| If you or if any of your constituents want more information regarding this election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| or they have a question, we get them literally every single day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| as I'm sitting here looking at Debra,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| please have them visit KnoxVotes.org| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| or they can give our office a call during business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| We will make every attempt to try and answer their questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| and ultimately, understanding that this is a very complicated and difficult election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| particularly due to the length of the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| we're going to try and get all of their questions answered if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| Thank you very much, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| Our first individual for public forum is Karen Bussell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| Ms. Bussell, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| I will call our next person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| That is Jeremy McCord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1457)|
| 0:24:25| Evening, Mr. McCord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| If you'll state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| I'll have the clerks set the timer at five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| My name is Jeremy McCord, and I'm a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| And I was just coming to speak on behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| just so you guys could hear from somebody else when it comes to all the merit system stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| I was present at the last meeting, listened to the conversation, what it came to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| I've been in communication with Commissioner Jay about things with his proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| But one thing I want to do is address the body and ask the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| so you can leave with this, is what are we going to do to prevent this from happening again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| While I understand that there's this process that Commissioner Jay has started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| within that process there's no checking in period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| There's still no defined term limits or time limits for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| the sheriff to have a recording of applications or however that's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| So if we're going to do this, we've got to clearly define it instead of just saying periodically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| And also, if we've had this stuff in place anyway and the oversight has laid with the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| how has, you know, what's transpired been allowed to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| Did we not know until recently that commission did in fact oversee the merit system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| And if so, why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| Those are some questions that, you know, that a lot of us have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| because it's cost a lot of taxpayers money, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| But at the end of the day, there are things in place with the current merit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| that says that if a grievance is filed, it's supposed to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| But somehow, in some way, within the past two years, the grievances that have been filed weren't heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| And that's where we got into the money because all these attorneys got involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| And what is in place with the proposed actions that will allow for this not to occur again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1562)|
| 0:26:09| I.e., if there is a grievance, it should be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| And I know that the eye-rolling and everything else is going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| because all we're focusing on is one grievance, and it's about a car and a gas card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| And a civilian employee at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| What I'm talking about coming to you from is somebody that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| as someone that has tried to get people to come and work at the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| and to talk to them about pay, incentives, and the type of work environment that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| One of the things that comes with that is a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| It's a take-home car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| And I don't know how you want to quantify it because we want to look at one legal argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| that say it's not part of your salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| I get that and appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| But at the same time, for a uniformed police officer or a detective or somebody on call 24-7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| that vehicle is, I don't know what other term other than to describe it as a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| The other thing that's never considered in any of this writing is post-certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| When we talk about a sheriff's deputy, they have to attend a minimal training period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| and they actually have to go to a post-certified academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| In doing so, they must maintain their employment in a law enforcement position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| which is recognized by post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| So language with that, education with that, and setting that ball rolling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| to make sure that this ordinance includes language like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| or the ordinance is in place and commission is willing to listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| and take steps to make sure that we have new rules put in place within the merit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| and their rules is another option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| And the other thing is just with the changing of the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| and everything else that's been alleged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| specifically what rules have been changed in the past ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| that were not met by county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| or that committee that Commissioner Jay was a part of a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| I think two of the four things that you all had got pushed through and the other two did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| I'm not relevant to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| But again, I think the main issue with this right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| is understanding the classifications of officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| because we use that term throughout the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| But I really don't know if everybody understands and sees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| the requirements that law enforcement officers have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| and also what comes with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| While I do agree it's not a salary benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| I'm very aware of the suit that you quoted last week about salary and pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1708)|
| 0:28:36| I do think that at some point commission needs to look and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| we're giving every marked patrol unit and detectives that qualify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| and respond to the community, they have cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| So that is something that we have to look at in the roles and duties of those deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| And if those roles and duties were to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| we have to consider that post-certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| because that's very important to a law enforcement officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| because if you're in a non-law enforcement position for an extended period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| you would actually have to go and either attend another academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| an abbreviated academy, or have another agency pick up your certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1745)|
| 0:29:13| And my time is almost up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| Thank you, and I'll be in touch again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| Thank you for responding to me too today, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| Thank you, Mr. McCord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| Next speaker is Robert Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1762)|
| 0:29:30| Good evening, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| If you'll state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| you have five minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| My name is Robert Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| I live on Ridgeview Road near the Toppenock subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| And does everybody have the map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| So what I want to do is just explain to you what this map is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| If you look, you see in the lower left-hand corner Murphy Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| and the traffic signal that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| The next traffic signal from there on Tassel Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| and that's the black line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| the next traffic signal is all the way up at Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| So they're spaced pretty far apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| If you leave the Toppenock area right now with Old Tassel Pike open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1812)|
| 0:30:19| it's 1.3 miles to get down to the signal at Tassel Pike and Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| And the reason that's important is because during peak hours especially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| with all the traffic that's come from the development in the north part of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| even into Union County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| it's not safe and you really just can't take a left on Tassel Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| without being at a signal and having that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| So as things stand now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| it's 1.3 miles down to get to that signal before we can go left on Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1851)|
| 0:30:58| If we close Old Tassel Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| then the next closest way to get to that signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| is 4.1 miles around to get back to that signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| so we can take a safe left on Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| The next one beyond that would be to go up to Jones Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| The red lateral line is the one I was just talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| The blue line over at Jones Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| if you take that route to get back to that signal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| it's 5.8 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| And then if you go all the way up to Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| and use that signal where you can get a left on Tassel Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| by the time you get back down to Murphy Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| you've traveled an additional 9.8 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| So I don't know, is there anyone on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| that doesn't have to pay retail for gasoline right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| Well, I won't even make that point because I don't need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| But obviously this creates a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| with a lot of extra travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| Now, I don't really mind if that road gets closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| I spoke to the county engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| She told me that it was overcapacity and too narrow, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1934)|
| 0:32:20| But the Luttrell Road route and the Jones Road route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| are also very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| Neither of those roads is wide enough to justify a yellow center line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| So neither of those roads have a yellow center line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| because they're too narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| And, of course, traveling an extra 9.8 miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| an extra 10 miles basically, to get out of our homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| and try to go towards Fountain City is also a bit off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1964)|
| 0:32:52| So what I would ask is if we do need to close Old Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| that is what actually happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| We would like to have a signal at the end of Ridgeview and Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1982)|
| 0:33:10| This would be the only logical alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| to providing people with reasonable travel from our homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| if that Old Tazewell Pike linkage is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2003)|
| 0:33:32| Everybody's quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| Not any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| But that's what I just want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| I wanted to bring you the map and make you aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| Thank you so much, Mr. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| The commissioners can certainly discuss this further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| when the item comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| I would like to add that when I was walking over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| a motorcycle tourist was asking me for directions around Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| and he complimented on how clean the city is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| And your recognition was great today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| but I think when people are just out of the blue complimenting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| on how clean the city is and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| I think that speaks even more volumes than the recognition today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Thank you, Mr. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Is Ms. Bussell here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| Karen Bussell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| We will call for Ms. Bussell again at the second segment of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| This time, Madam Clerk, please read the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| Approval of minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| I have a motion by Commissioner Busseller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| with a second by Commissioner Biggs to approve the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2076)|

| 0:36:46| 48 is consideration of the closure of a portion of Old Tassel Pike near the First Comforter Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| to improve safety for motorists and adjacent residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| I'm looking to one of my colleagues right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| Commissioner Durrett, I believe this is still in my district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| It's real close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| I'm going to offer a motion since we're really not supposed to discuss until we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| I'm going to offer a motion to postpone this second reading until the July Commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2236)|
| 0:37:23| for the reason that I don't oppose the closure and I really like what Mr. Jones had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2243)|
| 0:37:33| I grew up probably two or three houses down from Mr. Jones, so I know the area really, really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| I'm not opposed to the closure, but there are other factors that I would love to be able to get more input from the community about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| I think anytime we're going to close a road that people use, we need to have dialogue with the community as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2265)|
| 0:37:53| Mr. Snowden, are you in the house, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| If you wouldn't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| Is there a second to the motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| Second by Commissioner, I'll give it to Commissioner Durrett since it borders her district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| Mr. Snowden, are you open to meeting with the community a little bit more on some other proposals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2290)|
| 0:38:18| I mean, not necessarily other proposals, but additional proposals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| Sure, and I met out there last week with some of the folks that spoke here last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| and certainly we're open to finding the best solution that solves some of the safety concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| but yet also minimizes the inconvenience to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| There was a couple of suggestions brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| I'm actually meeting with TDOT traffic office this Friday, and that's one of the topics of conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2318)|
| 0:38:45| They've offered to do a, because I think this gentleman's right, I think one of the things that would ultimately be the best thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2325)|
| 0:38:52| would maybe install potentially a traffic signal at Ridgeview to allow for better egress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| but obviously that's state route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| They would have to approve that signal, but they did commit to doing the traffic study at that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| so we can kind of vet through those processes and hopefully find a good outcome for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| I don't mean to jump ahead because we have two commissioners with lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| Is discussion of a real fix of Ridgeview and Carter Road possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2353)|
| 0:39:19| That's funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| I was talking to the mayor about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| We've talked about that location and trying to eliminate some of those conflict points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2362)|
| 0:39:31| Ideally, aligning Carter Road, anybody that's driven that road knows that the vertical is really problematic there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2371)|
| 0:39:41| as well as the side slopes of the roadway, and then Ridgeview comes down at an angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2381)|
| 0:39:48| Ideally, and I think we probably need to bring both legs into to really meet the signal warrants for the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| because if you drive Ridgeview Road through the day, it's probably pretty easy to get out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| but if you try to leave at 5 o'clock, then it's problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| If we were able to have a project to align both those intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| I think it would probably meet the warrant that the state would be looking for for traffic lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| and really eliminate a lot of conflict points there and a location that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| because we had even talked about closing the road through the curves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| I can't think of there, north of that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| So that would be a place where we could have a lot more safer access onto Tassel Pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2425)|
| 0:40:32| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Commissioner Smith and then Jay and then Bussard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| Director Snowden, to Mr. Jones' point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| I know we're trying to eliminate a bad intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| but I'm starting to get more concerned about the law of unintentional consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2448)|
| 0:40:56| Are we going to be, everybody on that side of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| are we going to be sending them down other substandard roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| And that's kind of what I want to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| Yeah, and that's one of the things, when we counted Old Tassel Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| the ADT or the average daily traffic on the road was about 250 trips a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2473)|
| 0:41:21| What we would anticipate to see there, based on the homes on the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| was about 50 trips a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| So a big portion of the traffic was cut-through traffic for convenience purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| About the peak hour, about 20 vehicles in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| and then that return, 20 in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| When we do the analysis for the traffic lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| we can also run delay calculations and see how much increased delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| that additional 20 trips would add to Tassel Pike at Ridgeview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| So, yeah, that is something that, as we go through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| we'd be happy to look at alternate routes, delay added to those motors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| And I haven't looked at it to see how much developable lands on that side too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| but as we increase, that volume will increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| I think this is something we need to take a long-term view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| solutional approach to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| Mr. Snowden, if TDOT was agreeable, given that this is a state route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| is this a project that we could do on their behalf and fast-track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| or is this a yes but watch the glaciers grow or fade while they put it into the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2547)|
| 0:42:34| and it's a six-year turnaround?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| Yeah, it would be, if we were to fund it through county dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| obviously it would move a lot quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| If it were state funding, we'd probably have to go through the TPO process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| which is a lot longer and an arduous process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| but if it is something that we felt like was a priority for our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| and we were to fund, I mean, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| we could definitely get something under construction within 12 to 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| Mr. Snowden, you were also talking about Carter Road that you're going to get lined up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2587)|
| 0:43:14| I don't see how, unless you move half the dirt on the other side of the hill down that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2594)|
| 0:43:21| to get it anywhere close because of the incline that you have there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| and it would involve some houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| Can we afford to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| It would be a very expensive project to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| To put up a signal at an isolated location, it's probably around $300,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| so in the absence of turn lanes and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| a type of project of that magnitude, because you'd have to put turn lanes on all four approaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| to your point, there would be significant topography challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| as well as potential relocations of businesses and or homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| I mean, it would be several million dollars without question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| You can see now where Carter Road comes out on Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| There's been a number of accidents happen there because of the guardrail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| that kind of blocks your view from getting up on Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| and it gets very slick right there when you turn down Carter Road or come up on Carter Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| to get on Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| While we're looking at that, can you also take a look at what we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| to maybe lessen the Carter Road effect of people getting on Tazewell Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| One of the things we can do is as asphalt ages, it polishes so it becomes a little slicker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| and with that steep grade, we could put some anti-skid asphalt on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| that gives folks a little better chance coming up out of that hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| because it is very, very steep right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| Thank you, Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| Any further questions for Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=2688)|

| 0:50:35| It's amending Knox County Code Chapter 42 by repealing Sections 42-51 through 42-66| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3035)|

| 0:50:59| Knox County into compliance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| This amends Ordinance O-90-9-11 adopted September 10, 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3062)|

| 0:51:51| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| As one of the sponsors of this ordinance, I want to look to my co-sponsor, Commissioner Busler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3117)|
| 0:52:03| and I would like to withdraw this ordinance if it is agreeable to the co-sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3123)|
| 0:52:09| If not, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| The one thing I was trying to do with this is to make sure we came in compliance with state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| and this does state that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| I know we want to do some other things for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3139)|
| 0:52:25| but I would like to see it pass so we can make amendments to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3145)|
| 0:52:32| and pass what the state law tells us to do, which specifically states that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3152)|
| 0:52:40| Well, I won't withdraw it if the co-sponsor so desires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3160)|
| 0:52:48| So the chair will look to a motion on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| I have a motion to approve by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| Second by Commissioner Durant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| Commissioner Dayton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| I thought the question was brought up last week, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| that can we add the state act into the next resolution and that would cover that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3191)|
| 0:53:23| I thought that was asked by Commissioner Durant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| Was that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| I was comparing the difference between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| They are not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| My question will be can we, the Tennessee Code of Annotated, put into Item 57| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3215)|
| 0:53:42| and it still cover it with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| What you've got here is what we're operating under currently was originally a private act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| that was passed before Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| The private act was carried forward when the charter was adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| and has been amended from time to time since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| The Civil Service Act of 1974 is a state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| We can adopt it, but I don't believe we have the authority then to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| So if we adopt it, we're stuck with those provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| Like them, don't like them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| That's what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| What Item 57 is attempting to do is to take the private act that we've been operating under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3255)|
| 0:54:22| whenever it's past 1970, I think, and has been amended from time to time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| and amended again further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| So if you adopt the state act, you're kind of stuck with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| If you keep what you have now, you can amend it from time to time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| as circumstances change using our power as a charter county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3279)|
| 0:54:45| So there are two very different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| I mean, we're both looking at the merit-sense system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| but these are two very different ways to skin a cat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| and so they're really incompatible with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| You can do one or the other, but not really both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| Thank you for that great explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| I'm in favor of not tying this commission hands in the future myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3301)|
| 0:55:08| Commissioner Bussel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| Mr. Law Director, let me make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| Let me make sure that this is going to take care of what we tried to address some time ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3316)|
| 0:55:22| when Law Director Book offered this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| So will this take care of any suits and other things that's coming on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3326)|
| 0:55:32| Well, the lawsuit that was pending when this was brought up was a lawsuit by the Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3332)|
| 0:55:38| challenging the viability of the original enacting ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| The Sheriff has dropped that lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| There is nothing in court now that challenges that suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| Whether it could be brought back again, it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| Would it be held by a court to be valid or not valid, can't say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3355)|
| 0:56:01| I think I could make a pretty strong argument either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| I think, frankly, a better one for the viability of the ordinance, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| But it would be a potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| And if, in the fullness of time, somebody did challenge the ordinance, if a court overturned it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| then the Act of 1974 would still be available for this county commission to pass and to adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3380)|
| 0:56:28| So if you adopt the 1974 Act, you're kind of tied to that forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3388)|
| 0:56:34| If you adopt the ordinance amendment and in the future it becomes apparent that there's a problem with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| then we can always go back and adopt the 1974 Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| And the reason why I brought this up is how much has this cost us in legal fees by not having it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3404)|
| 0:56:52| I mean, when the Sheriff brought the suit against, how much did that cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| Nothing as far as I'm—well, I think we may have paid a little bit to the attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| who was appointed to represent the Merit Council, but not much was done in this litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| So I doubt it was—I don't have the numbers, but I don't think it was very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| Thank you, Commissioner. Thank you, Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| Did you see his light first, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| No, no. I thought I saw another light on, but I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| Oh, okay. You have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| You're keeping the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| Mr. Moyers, the ordinance that we currently are operating under that I'm proposing to amend in Item No. 57,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3447)|
| 0:57:36| which is what we're not on but as it ties to the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| is a private act that was established in 1970 and then carried over as we became a charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3460)|
| 0:57:49| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| In those 52 years, are you aware of anyone else that has challenged the validity of working under that ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3470)|
| 0:57:57| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| And I've been here for more than half of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| Okay. I wasn't implying otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| So we currently have an ordinance that is a legally binding ordinance and is law of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3486)|
| 0:58:14| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| And that is what we're amending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| But if we as a body decide to pick to adopt the 1974 Act, there are no amendments, there are no revisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3496)|
| 0:58:25| there is no you get what you get from 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| End of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3511)|
| 0:58:32| You would have to get the state to amend that act if you wanted an amendment or to pass another private act that applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3512)|
| 0:58:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| Thank you, Mr. Jay. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| Mr. Chairman, I'm curious what your thoughts were on withdrawing this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| At the time that this ordinance was brought forth, which was in May, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3534)|
| 0:59:01| I could be wrong, but I think it was May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| I really felt it was incumbent upon me as the chair of this body to take some sort of proactive step on the part of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3545)|
| 0:59:15| in case there were a quote-unquote unfavorable ruling toward the existing merit council by the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3555)|
| 0:59:23| I really did not sponsor this ordinance on its merits, but I did feel like it was necessary to show that the commission was doing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3563)|
| 0:59:33| Or we perhaps ran the risk of our officers not being protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| Since the suit has been dropped, as Mr. Moyer said, there have been no similar suits filed since merit systems were created as far as we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3577)|
| 0:59:49| I would ask this question if someone knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| The other major metropolitan counties in the state, are they under the 1974 act or are they under private acts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3592)|
| 1:00:01| Or do they have their own civil service boards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| Does anyone know the answer to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| I know that Hamilton and Davidson, I believe those are private acts, but I would have to verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3612)|
| 1:00:21| Okay. Did you know the answer to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| Potentially. Metro Nashville, since it is a metro form of government, I think it operates differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3623)|
| 1:00:31| I believe it's the same with Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| Hamilton County follows the state 1974 act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| I know we've been told they have nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| That's actually nine commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| They have three on their merit system council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| I guess that would be another part of my reasoning would be that there are obviously some other large metropolitan counties that operate under their own created merit system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3649)|
| 1:01:01| which gives them some flexibility to make changes as they deem necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| Question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| I don't particularly like the 1974 act simply because it does tie our hands and allows us not to make any changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3672)|
| 1:01:19| And it's set up probably for more of rural small counties than it is for a county our size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3679)|
| 1:01:26| But I want to go back to how we got to it to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| And I could be wrong about this, but this is what I believe I understood to be the case of why we were trying to pass it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3690)|
| 1:01:37| was we passed it in 1970 under a private act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| And when we incorporated our charter, we didn't recognize it to continue was the argument why it may not be in existence anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3703)|
| 1:01:53| No, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| My understanding of the argument, and, again, this litigation was started before I returned, and I was not heavily involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3715)|
| 1:02:05| But as I understand the argument, the argument is that this act in some way tied the hands of the sheriff in a way that was inconsistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3725)|
| 1:02:19| with the language of the charter that says the sheriff's duties shall not be changed by anything in this charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| That, as I understand it, was the argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| I'm not going to pass on the merits of that argument, but that was the argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| So as I say, the lawsuit has been dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| I think the reason that the ordinance, this ordinance particularly, adopted in the 1974 Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3759)|
| 1:02:47| was presented to the county commission, was in case the court, which had the case in front of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3767)|
| 1:02:53| and could have ruled pretty much any time, ruled that the amendment was not valid or that the ordinance was not valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3773)|
| 1:03:02| In that case, at least for some period of time until this commission acted to adopt the 1974 Act, there would not be a merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3782)|
| 1:03:09| I think the idea was rather than have that break in coverage, put this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| But now, since the lawsuit has been dropped, there is no threat presently hanging over the merit system that a judge is going to rule it to be invalid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3795)|
| 1:03:25| So this commission has the ability now to look at amendments rather than just jumping into the 1974 Act if it wishes to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3805)|
| 1:03:35| So the continuation of our use of an ordinance after our incorporation has not eliminated our private act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3815)|
| 1:03:44| No, I mean, basically, the way the charter is set up, I remember this well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3824)|
| 1:03:50| We went through all the private acts that applied to Knox County and made recommendations to the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3830)|
| 1:03:56| for the ones we wanted to keep and the ones we wanted to toss over the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| If you look at the Knox County Charter, you see a whole list of private acts that are no longer valid because we didn't carry them forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3839)|
| 1:04:05| The Merit System Council is one that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| And because we did, it's now a Knox County ordinance and can be amended by the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| Thank you for clearing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| Commissioners, we received an email on Thursday, June 23rd, that included a memo from our previous law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3860)|
| 1:04:30| And it includes answers to questions that were asked by the executive director of the merit system, Ms. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3870)|
| 1:04:42| And then the breakdown analysis for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| And it essentially says that we should, that we do technically operate under, that we are governed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3886)|
| 1:04:55| it says the merit system is governed by the County Sheriff's Civil Service Law of 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3895)|
| 1:05:01| If that is the case, then how can we have these ordinances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| It's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| We muddied the water a lot more than it already was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| I have not read that memo. I'm aware of its existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3913)|
| 1:05:19| It was from June 14th, 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| I think that that memo assumes that the Knox County Commission had sometime in the past adopted, by two-thirds resolution, the 1974 Civil Service Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3925)|
| 1:05:37| Factually, I don't think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| I don't believe that there's any evidence that that has ever occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| If it did, it was fairly recent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3943)|
| 1:05:48| It had not been done, I can tell you for absolute fact, between 1988 and 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3948)|
| 1:05:58| So it would have been fairly recent if it had been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| I don't think that factually that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| I don't believe this County Commission has ever voted to adopt that act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| Had we done so, all the provisions that currently exist in the Knox County Charter regarding the merit system would be out of the Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3968)|
| 1:06:16| So I believe that that is premised on a misapprehension of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3976)|
| 1:06:31| Thank you, Mr. Moyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=3991)|

| 1:09:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| Fellow commissioners, I came to you last week with a set of reforms that I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| will make the merit system better functioning, more honest, transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4175)|
| 1:09:41| fair, and while maintaining what is its original purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| to be an apolitical body that provides protections for our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| And I stand by that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| I want to thank you all for the commissioners that provided questions and suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4194)|
| 1:10:00| Commissioner Durant and Commissioner Hill, in particular, pointed out a few items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| Last week, at the end of the week, I met with the command staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| and many of the supervisors of the Knox County Sheriff's Officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| and sat and went through the proposed reforms, answered questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| As you've seen through your email and on the forum, I continued to answer questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| and then spent a good bit of time today with the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| addressing some of those concerns, addressing some of the questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| and putting a few additional items in there that I believe will help either clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4233)|
| 1:10:39| some positions or bring more protections or assurances to the officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| of the Knox County Sheriff's Office to the ordinance proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4243)|
| 1:10:50| There has been a new Exhibit A that has been revised once again this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4250)|
| 1:10:57| has been uploaded to our digital agenda, and you have a copy in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| Some of the key elements of that, of the latest revisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| just quickly establishes right off the bat a grandfather clause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| for all existing Knox County Sheriff's Office members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| employees currently under protected status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| outlining that anyone who is under that particular status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| by the time that this ordinance may take effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| will continue to be under that classified protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| and be grandfathered in, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| It also outlines, provides some new language as it relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| to the Merit System Board members operating in an apolitical environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4297)|
| 1:11:43| I want to point out that this language mirrors what the state outlines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| for existing Merit Council, Merit System employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| So this is direct language that the current Merit System employees operate under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| It's just adapted to be for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| So it clarifies a little bit of how they need to act and operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4320)|
| 1:12:07| It also adds language at the end for conflicts of laws or severability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4327)|
| 1:12:16| as it relates to how this either works with state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| or any parts or pieces of the Merit Council reforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| And then it replaces some language back in section 4260 on page 8| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4344)|
| 1:12:31| regarding transfers, and it specifically puts back language in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4351)|
| 1:12:37| establishing or recognizing the rules of the Merit System Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| that deal with transfers, specifically section 7.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| And then adds one more clarification at the end of the revision of 4267| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4366)|
| 1:12:54| when it comes to grievances, outlining also overtime hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| There was one other item that was suggested by one of the command staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4379)|
| 1:13:04| I just want to point out publicly they asked for any ruling to be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4384)|
| 1:13:13| in a timely manner, any grievance hearing to be heard in a timely manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| and to be ruled on in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| And we actually have that already in the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| I just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4401)|
| 1:13:28| I've got to find it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| Page 9, 42-61C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| The commission finds that it is in the interest of all parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| to have a speedy resolution of grievances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| Therefore, the Merit System Board shall be required to investigate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| hear, and resolve, meaning give the ruling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| any grievance filed within 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| So I just wanted to point out that was already in the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| I present to you these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| I'm happy to answer any questions, walk through, discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| I hope I've addressed all the major issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| and I present it to you for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| I hope that you will adopt it so we can move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| and begin continuing to support our officers in a dynamic way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| Senior Director of Human Resources is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| I wanted to see if she wanted to come down and say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4459)|
| 1:14:35| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| So we're still in discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| We're still working with the mayor on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| and really probably don't have anything at this reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| that's changed from last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| Yes, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| Ma'am, could you state your name and department, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| Stephanie Candler, Senior Director of Human Resources and Benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| Knox County Government, 400 Main.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4497)|
| 1:15:04| Commissioner Smith, you still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| Commissioner Jay, the 74 Act lists the number of appointees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| Our current ordinance lists the number of appointees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| But you have left that number off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| And I saw your response to, I think it was Mr. Monroe, an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4518)|
| 1:15:25| I've spoken with the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| He's okay with putting a number on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| And I would wonder why would you want to leave that open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| Well, I think specifically I want to just refer to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| so everybody understands where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| This is 4252.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4540)|
| 1:15:50| It's on page 1 of Exhibit A, 4252 positions and employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4550)|
| 1:15:55| included in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| The specificity of exactly the chief deputy, personal secretary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| and seven other positions was removed simply to allow any future sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4563)|
| 1:16:09| to have more flexibility in running an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| We have a duly elected sheriff by the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| And what I've learned, if anything, through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| is we're dealing with very rigid governmental rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4579)|
| 1:16:24| And any time you need to adapt to a very dynamic workforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4584)|
| 1:16:30| a very dynamic changing environment with law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| or any kind of government, I think the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| or any law enforcement is kind of a different ballgame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4596)|
| 1:16:41| Government is meant, and rules and regs like this and laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| are meant to be very strict and very rigid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| And you can see, if you want to change even a small something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| it's a long and arduous process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| And I believe that any future sheriff should have a lot more flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| in how to build their team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| That's why we elect a sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| That's why we have term limits, and that's what the people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| But this was very restrictive, and it seemed a little archaic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| in the language, and so I removed it to give more flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4629)|
| 1:17:14| to any future sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| It wants to prevent some future sheriff from not going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| the Merit Council at all and just all new hires are appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| and have no Merit Council protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| Well, it wouldn't be possible, one, because of classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| It also wouldn't be possible because of budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| I mean, at some point there's a limitation to how many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| anyone can hire based upon the amount of resources they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| at their disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| It doesn't close every loophole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| I think what we've learned is that every possible scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4663)|
| 1:17:47| isn't thought for, but instead of having a rigid set of X, Y, Z,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4667)|
| 1:17:53| I just left it more open-ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| Does anybody else feel that that's a potential problem in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| that being open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4679)|
| 1:18:06| I actually don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| I agree with Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| I think as a small business owner, he really is running a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| even though it's the business of law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| being able to pick the staff around him to do the best job possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| Did we see 20 years ago that we were going to have chess cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| for every cop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| I don't know what the future is going to hold for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| if there's different systems where he needs to make quick hires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| or changes or something becomes archaic because of new technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| or there's a new method of policing where we get away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4716)|
| 1:18:43| from some of our older ways and have new philosophies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| But I agree we elect the sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| and they should be able to put the best team around them possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4729)|
| 1:18:54| and then the guy after him or the gal after him that gets elected a sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| should be able to put their people around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| I don't think we should restrict them and hold them down to staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| that's being held over and held over and held over from three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| four sheriffs ago that might not work well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4747)|
| 1:19:13| That's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4753)|
| 1:19:14| How many people do you need to create your staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| I guess one of my questions, Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| is just sort of what was the original intent of putting –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| I mean I would go to reverse engineering and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| what's the original intent of putting that in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| and what is the potential issue that might arise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4770)|
| 1:19:34| It gives potential freedom to the current sheriff to surround himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| with the necessary staff, and that's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| What is that number that's necessary instead of making it just open-ended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| I think that's for the sheriff to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| I mean much like all of our other constitutional offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| I talked to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| He gave me a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| Okay, but I'm not writing – I didn't write this for this sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| I mean I'm sort of thinking about five or six sheriffs for now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| and I would think of this as how many people would the trustee need around them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4802)|
| 1:20:09| to run their office, or the clerk, or the register of deeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| or any other constitutional office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| We don't restrict them on who they can and can't have on their senior team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| or on their personal team to run an agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| I was trying to figure out why would we do the same for a sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4822)|
| 1:20:28| versus any other constitutional officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4828)|
| 1:20:35| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| You still have the floor, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| I have a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| For Merritt, the staff to go under HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4848)|
| 1:20:54| what would be the actual responsibilities of the HR senior director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| since he or she is now added to this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4859)|
| 1:21:04| I know it said –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4864)|
| 1:21:11| Let's just refer, if you could, to the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4871)|

| 1:21:16| It is 42-53E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4876)|
| 1:21:27| It says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| Oversee the budget administrative operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| and conduct annual performance reviews of all personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| in accordance with Knox County HR policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| Does that mean that our HR director is strictly doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4898)|
| 1:21:45| and has nothing to do with the procedure that the Merritt staff follows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4905)|
| 1:21:51| That's not for me to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| I don't think that's for us to decide in this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| That's a level of HR that I didn't put in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| because I didn't feel like it was warranted for the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| to be involved with those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| But we're putting it in their lap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4926)|
| 1:22:12| It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4932)|
| 1:22:13| It could not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| I think it's to be determined once –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| The purpose of nesting this inside of HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4937)|
| 1:22:21| is that I believe that every employee ought to have some supervision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| and some oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| And currently the Merritt system employees don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4947)|
| 1:22:31| And so it has to go somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| And I didn't think it was proper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| mostly for the political aspect of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| for those four employees to report to this 11-member body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| or their appointed board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| as appointed by the mayor and this 11-member body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| So somebody has to manage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| How they manage that is to be determined but not by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| And this is the best place I could find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| is somebody who actually works as an HR professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| that understands an HR role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| how that administers it beyond that is not the purview of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4989)|
| 1:23:15| But if you look at other boards, say the audit board, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| it is my understanding that the employee who works in audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5000)|
| 1:23:26| actually reports to the board, the audit board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5006)|
| 1:23:32| for purchasing and for that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| So why would we not be able to do that in this situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| I think that's one option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| I don't know if it's the best option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| I think there's several different other committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| in pension and retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| I mean, we could probably go through the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| and look at which ones are set up one way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| and which ones are set up the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| Some have administrative oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| Some have administrative functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| Some don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| I think that's an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| I just don't know if it's the best option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| Okay, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| I don't know if HR is the best option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| That's kind of why we're in this predicament| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| because HR is this all-encompassing body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5053)|
| 1:24:18| that has to deal with more than just a few boards here and there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| and they have to learn to partner with all of these different departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5061)|
| 1:24:26| within Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| Our HR director even came to us last week to ask for a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| because she had just received this that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| and now we have gone and changed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| not necessarily that portion of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| but to give, as she said a moment ago, she's still in talks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5082)|
| 1:24:48| So I think we still owe her professional courtesy to postpone this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| even though it is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| If we make substantial changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| then we might be right back here on first reading again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| And if we're sitting here saying we don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| what exactly the best option would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| I think it would behoove us as representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| to do what is best the first go-around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| instead of have to go back and rework things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| Well, as the proposer of the ordinance changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| I'm putting forward what I think is the best option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| That's for you all to vote on and amend if necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| but to essentially vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| So I'm not saying that there aren't an infinite amount of options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| for any of this stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| but after really a long amount of time and a lot of effort to put forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| I believe this is the best place to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| And I do think there should be administrative oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5140)|
| 1:25:44| for every employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| I'm a firm believer in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| I believe that the best place for this to end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| is somebody in an HR professional role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| not a political role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| The goal has always been to try to remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| as many politics out of it as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| even within its own board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| Commissioner Ward, your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| I've got a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| I'm looking through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| Can you direct me in this exhibit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| that states that if this working document is passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| at the current time on page 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| we're talking about the structure of the Merit System Board going to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5188)|
| 1:26:34| At the time, how do we restructure in August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| Do all 7 come off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| Do we have an election of 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| We stagger 2 into 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| I see that, but will there be a new slate that we pick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| Can you just brush me up on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| Thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| Ultimately, we have 2, maybe 3 members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| that may still be serving terms on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| and it would be my intention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| that they would continue to serve those terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| Obviously, we have an August election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| and one of those may win an August election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| and not be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| So there's a little bit of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| we have to wait and see how it pans out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| But ultimately, we would come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| and I believe if I'm correct, Mr. Moyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| we could come back with a simple resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| that as we do with every nominating process that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| we hereby establish the Merit System Board of Directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| according to the ordinance XYZ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| and establish the terms of those members 1 through 7 as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5252)|
| 1:27:38| Members 1, 2, 3 are rolled over from their term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| and will serve until this date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| Members 4 and 5 will have this much term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| and 5 and 6 will have this much term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| And in one resolution, we can establish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| bring those current members over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| and stagger all in one swoop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| and then that would go through as one nomination process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| We would put out the notice, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| People would apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| and we would do a regular nomination process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| and send it all through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| and essentially start a new established board in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5287)|
| 1:28:13| So my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| if the spot held is vacated due to a win on August the 4th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5295)|
| 1:28:22| would our, would the person that is our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5302)|
| 1:28:28| I'm trying to think of his name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| the gentleman that's serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| The alternate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5311)|
| 1:28:32| The alternate. His name just left me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| Would he automatically go into that seat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| No, we could put him in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5316)|
| 1:28:37| as part of the resolution and nomination process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| but it would be, it was my intention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| if this passed through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| that I would bring a new resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| establishing that merit system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| and we would go through a regular nomination process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| so the alternate member would not become a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| in fact, I'm not sure, do we have an alternate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| I don't think we have an,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5336)|
| 1:28:57| no, we do have an alternate member right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| That would not be an automatic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| but that person certainly would be eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| just like any other citizen would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| Now, one of the key provisions in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| is if this passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| we would be really intentional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| in going back to even the existing merit council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| and saying, do you understand this new ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5355)|
| 1:29:19| Do you understand the apolitical nature of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| Do you understand the terms may be staggered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| your term may be different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| We would be very intentional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5365)|
| 1:29:26| in making sure they understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5366)|
| 1:29:27| what they were signing up for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| They may choose not to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5369)|
| 1:29:30| or they may choose to stick around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| And then, of course, it would be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| The mayor would have appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5374)|
| 1:29:35| we would have them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5375)|
| 1:29:36| but we would work through that first establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| And then, ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| we would also, probably by resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| I would imagine, Mr. Moyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| also give some direction to that board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| saying, okay, we have a new ordinance, new board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| You need to go back to your rules and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| within a 60-day period or 90-day period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| and make sure that all the rules and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| that you're operating under comply with the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| So there's going to be a little bit of housekeeping to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| in September and October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5406)|
| 1:30:07| but I would hope that by probably November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| we would have a regularly meeting on a quarterly basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| functioning, well-versed Merit Council board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5415)|
| 1:30:19| that would be up to speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| and be operating under the new ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| Can the alternate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| the alternate has no vote right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| on the current board, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| So if the seat is vacated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| the third seat, August 4th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| and it's a 60-day window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| the likelihood of a two-person body is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| Only probably for, I guess, 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| because we would bring the ordinance in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| which would be the third week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5445)|
| 1:30:46| or the resolution, excuse me, not ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| So it would probably be just a couple of week gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| and I'm not aware of anything that's before the board now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| that would require action that particular slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5460)|
| 1:31:01| I apologize, I forgot one of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| If you're going, page 11 of 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| the grievances which may be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| by the Merit System Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| are these the only ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| These are the grievances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| with the exception of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| these are the grievance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5480)|
| 1:31:21| these are things that are actual grievances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| and I'm going to look to Mr. Moyers to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| because we talked about this specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| With the exception of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| if you go back to transfers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| which I've got to find,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| 4260, that's on page 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| it does say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| inconsistent with the rules established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| by the Merit System Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| Now, if you go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| bear with me guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5510)|
| 1:31:51| if you go to the policies and procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| which you may or may not have in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| probably not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| on page 21 of their policies and procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| it lays out transfers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| and it outlines who can be transferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| and why and by the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| and it essentially says that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| if you don't follow these rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| that becomes a grievance too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| That is a grievable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| is that accurate, Mr. Moyers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| That is accurate, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| There are two different systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| there's grievances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5545)|
| 1:32:26| which go up the line to the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5546)|
| 1:32:27| and then there's matters that can be brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| to the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5549)|
| 1:32:30| This controls what can be brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| to the Merit Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| I think the transfer policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| And I think that's a very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| we had a long discussion about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| in that it's very important to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5560)|
| 1:32:46| a grievance doesn't automatically make a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| A grievance could be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| he just doesn't like me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| or he took away this thing and did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| I mean, sometimes there are grievances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| which are complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| that go up through the chain of command| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| and then sometimes there are wrongdoings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| that result in hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| and those are two different paths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| because there's not a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5589)|
| 1:33:13| you could open up that window to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| every time somebody felt like they were slighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| it turned into a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| That's not what this is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| This is for actionable things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| that result in what is laid out before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5603)|

| 1:33:27| If an action of a sheriff has been taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| and it turns into loss of salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| dismissal, suspensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| denial of leaves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| and as it outlines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| certain kinds of transfers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| then yes, you have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| to go before the Merit Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| but if every perceived wrong in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| turns into a hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| then this is not what this is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| No, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| Did I say that correctly, Mr. Moyers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| I want to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5635)|
| 1:33:56| I'm very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5636)|
| 1:33:57| Okay, so if an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| is transferred or demoted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| based on political activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| or for political reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| it is still a grievable offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| to go to the Merit Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| under this new ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| even though it is not technically listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| in 42-67 where it says grievances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| which may be addressed by the Merit System Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| The rules and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| that Commissioner Jay was speaking of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| on page 21 of the Merit Council rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| state that the individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| has a right to grievance procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| if they feel the transfer was not mission essential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5685)|
| 1:34:48| was a political decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| or was a violation of rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| Okay, yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| I just want to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5694)|
| 1:34:55| because any time we do these specific lists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| and those things that are not included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| I'm not saying that this is what could happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| but there is potential for it to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| oh, well, it's not in 42-67, so no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| it is not a grievable offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| to the Merit System Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| Well, the other thing to remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| is that this ordinance works hand in glove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5714)|
| 1:35:18| with the rules and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| of the Merit System Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5720)|
| 1:35:21| rules and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5721)|
| 1:35:22| which will have to be reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| and approved by this county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| So if the county commission finds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| that the rules and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| are not clear enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5730)|
| 1:35:31| or that this ordinance is lacking in some regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| you can amend those rules and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| to provide that procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| that you feel is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| The thing that we have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| is make sure one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| that I hear from the sheriff regularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| is that he doesn't have enough people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| It's hard to get people to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| So the sheriff has to send people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| where they're needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| So if you've got somebody who's on day shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| and we need more people on night shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5752)|
| 1:35:53| the sheriff may need to send somebody to night shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| That's not a grievable offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| It shouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5757)|
| 1:35:58| because the sheriff has to have the flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| to assign his people where and when they're needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5760)|
| 1:36:06| But just to clarify, Commissioner Durrett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| none of what you're referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5768)|
| 1:36:09| has been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| It's how it exists today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| and how it operates today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| Thank you, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5776)|
| 1:36:17| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| We have a proper motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5780)|

| 1:37:17| I'm going to make one last call for Ms. Bussle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| Is Ms. Bussle in the room or public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5840)|
| 1:37:26| I do not see her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| Is there any other business to come before this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5848)|
| 1:37:33| Chair, we'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| I didn't see your light, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| Oh, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5856)|

| 1:38:18| Panel discussion with different, I think it's two other counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| and I think I'm the only commissioner on the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| Well, represent us well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220627-business?start=5905)|
