| 0:12:20| We'll be back in about a minute and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=740)|
| 0:12:30| on just a couple of items. First of all, I want to remind you that Monday at 1 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| in the 6th floor County Commission Conference Room, you're invited to join me. We're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| to have a, we're going to be recognizing the former Chairs of the Commission and also we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| going to be converting that 6th floor Conference Room into our County Commission Conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| Room with some memorabilia and so forth. So, we'll be having a reception there at 1 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| I understand the Procurement Committee is then going to meet at 1.30, so we will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| done by 1.30. Second item has to do with redistricting. The City of Knoxville has appointed their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=776)|
| 0:13:04| person to be a part of the redistricting committee and that's Mr. Rick Emmett. The Town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| has also appointed their representative. I will be appointing four people from the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| to also serve on this redistricting. The School Board has also appointed their members for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| redistricting and both Ms. Kincannon and I have talked with Mr. Donaldson, asking the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| MPC if they will go ahead and start drawing up a proposal for us, which would align both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=804)|
| 0:13:32| the Commission Districts and the School Board Districts. So, that is underway. And so, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| kind of a briefing and an update. Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| Thank you, Mr. Chair. At the Chairman's Lunch, if my memory serves me correctly, I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| Mr. Emmett was a part of the committee and then the City was going to put a person on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| and the Town of Farragut was going to put a person on. So, again, I just, from my memory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=832)|
| 0:13:59| that Mr. Emmett was part of the committee, redistricting committee from the onset, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=839)|
| 0:14:06| maybe I'm... No, he was, he was, but Mayor Brown wrote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| me a letter and said that they wanted him to be their representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| Their representative, okay. So, that was Mayor Brown's request, so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| have done that. We have, we do not need to call the roll because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| this is a workshop setting. We're here today to talk about the Hillside and Ridgetop Protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| Plan. The reason that we're here this morning is because at our last meeting, the Commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| had said that they wanted to have a workshop setting where they could ask questions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| gain some information. So, it was not designed to be a public hearing. We are going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| a public hearing and we'll talk about that in a few minutes, but we had also, I had also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| sent around to the Commissioners a suggested guideline for how we would conduct the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| today and we had intended not to have formal presentations, but more of a question and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| answer session. Commissioner Norman has asked for a point of privilege that he be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| to do a presentation and I feel that if the Commissioners agree to his presentation, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| he says would be between 10 and 15 minutes, that those of you who are in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| that would like to come and speak after that, I want to give you that opportunity to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| so. For whatever time is taken, I would like to give you the opportunity to come and present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| anything that you would like to present. And then after that, we will come and have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| So, if the Commissioners have no objections, that's how we will proceed. If you do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| an objection. Yes, Commissioner Wright. No objection. I just wish to apologize for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| Ed Schaust. He had tickets, airline tickets out of town. He had those purchased before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=935)|
| 0:15:42| this meeting was scheduled and I think that it appropriate that I say that he is interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| in this process, but he's vacationing in other words. Can't blame him for that. So, if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=946)|
| 0:15:55| no objection to that, everyone understands. Commissioner Norman has asked for this personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| privilege to do this. Any of you afterwards will have an opportunity to come forward and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| we'll give you the same allotted amount of time. Then we're going to open it up for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| We'll have each Commissioner the opportunity to ask any questions. They can ask any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| of anyone that they would like to ask a question to. Yes, Commissioner McKenzie. Just to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| clear on this, after the presentation, I hate to put it in for and against, but those who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=977)|
| 0:16:24| are against this, of their choosing, are we going to assign certain entities that's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=984)|
| 0:16:34| to talk? I guess what I don't want to do is have five folks that want to say something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| and we give person one 15 minutes and we've got four folks going over and we end up extending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1000)|
| 0:16:47| it out to an hour. I would like to keep it this fairly equitable as far as time goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| This basically came up this morning. I understand. If you all could help us out here and if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1013)|
| 0:17:00| have a couple of people that would like to speak or whatever, you'll have your allotted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| time and however you want to allot that. So, Commissioner Norman, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I'd like to say thank you for all these people that came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| this early in the morning and are actively participating in the process. We've tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1036)|
| 0:17:23| to be inclusive three years of public meetings and sometimes in our public meetings we'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| have one or two people show up. We realize that it takes probably the vote or the nearness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1049)|
| 0:17:36| of the vote to get a high level of interest, but we appreciate you being here. So thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| you for participating. There's a couple of things. The presentation, of course, is by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1061)|
| 0:17:48| our staff, by MPC staff, and so we also were given the chamber evidently is working diligently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1068)|
| 0:17:58| at some efforts to address the plan in whatever way and they may be prepared for a presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1078)|
| 0:18:06| today also. And so it would be, I think it would be fine for them to present as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1086)|
| 0:18:16| if that's agreeable to the board. And so the only other thing that I would mention is there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1096)|
| 0:18:23| probably, there's several people here that we've heard from before and so I guess in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1103)|
| 0:18:31| somewhat to arm the chair, we certainly didn't intend to have a repetition of a lot of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1111)|
| 0:18:39| points that we've heard over and over and over in opposition. And so I think that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1119)|
| 0:18:48| fairness to time and to the issue and to consider all the work that's gone in, I hope that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1128)|
| 0:18:56| don't just repeat the same session that we had last time. So we've had, I don't mind public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| forum and I don't mind public input, but I hope the chair would insist on some newness of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1142)|
| 0:19:09| information. For us to repeat the same stuff is basically a waste of our time. So I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| that would take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| And if it's agreeable now, we're ready. This part of the presentation was part of our PowerPoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1160)|
| 0:19:31| that we were unable to present in the previous two meetings. So that's what we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1171)|
| 0:19:38| to get across, some examples, some comparisons between the plan that we propose and the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1178)|
| 0:19:46| that we currently have. That will be the emphasis in the presentation. So some side-by-side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| comparisons of the development of a piece of property that would be developed, could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1191)|
| 0:19:57| developed under both scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| So are we ready? Okay. I think Tim Coon, our KGIS personnel and staff will be starting, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1202)|
| 0:20:13| appreciate that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1213)|
| 0:20:20| Thanks for the opportunity to talk to you again this morning. I'll be making the presentation on behalf of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| our staff, but Mr. Donaldson, Mr. Carberry, Ms. Albertson and Mr. Johnson are all here for any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| that you may have. We're going to step through the development process to show you how this plan works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| and how this plan may change the development process. We're going to start with kind of a high-level view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1235)|
| 0:20:42| and by the end of the process we'll be coming down to the individual site to be able to see the impact of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| this plan. Let's dive in. I actually have probably 20 minutes of material. I'm going to try to do it quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1247)|
| 0:20:54| as we can. We want to start with just a brief discussion of property rights. Since this is an important issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| it's a basic fundamental right that we as Americans hold and that is the right to own, use, service and sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| property. We as property owners can make decisions about how we want to utilize our property. Those decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1264)|
| 0:21:11| are guided by zoning. So here's just a brief example of how property rights work. We can exercise a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| right to build or construct or improve our property in some way. One of the first steps in that property right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| is to leave the realm of property rights and enter the realm of development rights. The first step is does the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1283)|
| 0:21:31| property have the correct zoning for the use that the individual would like to use it for. If they do, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1291)|
| 0:21:40| construct the building. Under the development right, the other development rights in which you ask for permission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| or you receive permits to develop a property through building permits, stormwater permits, vehicle permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| various other types of permits, you ask permission to develop property. That's where the bulk of the changes to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1312)|
| 0:21:59| development process from this plan will occur is in the development rights scheme. What does change? What would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| affect property rights? If we change the parcel zoning, we would affect property rights because we would be changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| the amount, the types of uses that would be allowed on any property. We are not changing the parcel zoning. We are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| not changing any of the uses. We're not conditioning uses within the hillside area that's been defined. Any uses that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| are with the zoning currently remain intact. All the zoning remains intact. Will the adoption of the plan change the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1340)|
| 0:22:28| base designation of the sector plan? In other words, the uses that are proposed for a piece of land. No. If a parcel has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1348)|
| 0:22:37| base designation of low-density residential, commercial, office, whatever it might be, that stays with the parcel after the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| adoption of this plan. No new development ordinances are implemented. Now, we do implement the parcel zoning. We do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1362)|
| 0:22:49| implement a couple of changes to existing processes. Those are the three check marks in the yes column. We will recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| certain types of zones. We'll modify the framework for recommending density on residential development. And we'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1374)|
| 0:23:02| some policies to use in doing site plan review. These three pieces are what this presentation is going to focus on. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1382)|
| 0:23:10| plan does not create any new zoning districts on adoption or doesn't even recommend it. It doesn't create any new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| procedures or staff reviews. Everything we do is encapsulated inside an existing procedure or existing process. There are no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| new permits required to develop inside the hillside area. There are no new fees. There are no new ordinance or ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| changes that are adopted as a result of this plan. If you want to put a bow or a wrap around this, there's no new regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1407)|
| 0:23:34| no new red tape. As far as the residential development process, we're going to focus on stepping through this. Now, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| not going to look as closely at the commercial or office types of development. And that's because the bulk of the hillside and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1419)|
| 0:23:48| ridgetop protection area does not affect those types of uses. Ninety-seven and a half percent of the hillside area is in areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1428)|
| 0:23:57| intended for things like agricultural, rural residential, low-density residential uses. So that's where we're going to focus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| this. So we're going to focus on the subdivision process. We wanted to start with parcels that have zoning currently for low-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1443)|
| 0:24:14| density residential uses inside the hillside protection area. If you have ARA or RB zoning on a property, the existing process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1454)|
| 0:24:25| and we're trying to look at these side-by-side, the existing process is that the subdivision or a concept plan can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| submitted to the Metropolitan Planning Commission under the minimum subdivision regulations of Knox County. If that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1470)|
| 0:24:37| falls within the hillside protection area after adoption of this plan, there would be no change to that process. You still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| develop under the exact same minimum subdivision regulations that are in place today. Now, if you have PR zoning, you need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1482)|
| 0:24:49| submit a development plan to MPC for a site plan review. The only change to that process as a result of this plan is that during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| MPC site plan review, a staff can reference some of the policies inside the hillside protection plan, things such as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1495)|
| 0:25:03| reforestation or delineation of non-disturbance areas, some things of that nature, in doing those site plan reviews. But the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1503)|
| 0:25:10| site plan review is not new. It's done now. If you don't have the zoning on a property that you want to develop the project under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1510)|
| 0:25:19| you may need to go into a rezoning process. Typically, we see a lot of agricultural to parcel zoning. We see a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| planned residential zoning. Planned residential zone is kind of the zone du jour, so to speak, because it gives developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1524)|
| 0:25:31| flexibility to change the very lot sizes, have different types of housing units inside a development, attached units and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1531)|
| 0:25:38| If you don't have the right zoning, you need to go through a rezoning process. This plan implements no changes to the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| process. It's the exact same as it was prior to the plan. An application is submitted. MPC staff reviews it. They formulate a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| recommendation that is submitted to the Metropolitan Planning Commission, who has an option to approve, deny, modify, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1549)|
| 0:25:59| condition that request. It's forwarded to the County Commission, where the ultimate decisions for zoning still lie. They still lie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1559)|
| 0:26:06| with this body. Now, the MPC staff recommendation is the other part of what we want to focus on today. We include a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| recommendation for the type of zoning that should be given to a property. In the case of residential, the amount of density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1572)|
| 0:26:19| that should, the number of dwelling units per acre that should be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| So we want to start with what we have in place now for recommending these zones. We do currently have, in all 12 of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1585)|
| 0:26:32| sectors, a slope protection area that is based on a 15% slope. Anything 15% and above is captured inside this slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1592)|
| 0:26:40| protection area. It's delineated on all 12 of the sector plan maps. Now, the problem is that, as you know, we go through a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| process of updating these sector plans periodically, but that means that we've introduced a lot of variation in how the slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| protection areas are delineated in each of the sector plans. This map is highlighting the variability of this process. So the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1611)|
| 0:27:00| ones that are in pink and the ones that are in orange are delineated using GIS. Two different types of GIS data, but they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| delineated using GIS. A little bit more reliable. The ones that are in green are kind of some legacy data, some legacy areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| that we're still working with. They're hand delineated, and we'll show you what that process looks like. This is a USGS quad map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| and this is the process that was used. Technicians would take an index card, make marks on the index card every 3 16ths of an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1637)|
| 0:27:24| inch, and then count areas where there are more than five contour lines inside that 3 16ths of an inch. That was the basis for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1644)|
| 0:27:31| delineating the hillside protection area. So now with modern GIS data, we can overlay the two and look and see how successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| that exercise really was. I've highlighted two areas on the map. The areas that are shown on this map in yellow and red and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| orange are the areas of slope above 15%. So they've captured some of it, but note that the area to the north has been totally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1663)|
| 0:27:51| excluded. It's a ridge that's been totally missed through that delineation process. And an area to the south that's circled is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| area where there's no slope exceeding 15% that's been included for some reason. So it's not a very reliable process. So how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| reliable is it? We only capture about 28% of the slopes exceeding 15% when you delineate by hand. So it's a fairly dismal way of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1683)|
| 0:28:14| trying to depict where the steep slopes are in the county. With new technology, we can say with certainty where they are. So we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| want to update the process, give a uniform, consistent approach to every sector, to every parcel in the county, and this is the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| we want to do it. For the sectors that we've delineated using GIS, we have, based on the 15% slope, there will be no change. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1706)|
| 0:28:38| still starts at 15%. It's the way it has been done since the mid-90s. Now, the second concept in both of these models is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1718)|
| 0:28:47| called slope groups. Slope groups are contiguous areas of slope. That means it's an area of slope that exceeds 15% that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1727)|
| 0:28:55| contiguous. It's touching itself. So under the old delineation process using GIS, that size was two acres. We want to make it less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1735)|
| 0:29:05| restrictive. So we want to take some of the land out of the slope protection area. We want to say it's larger now. It's three acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| and it has to gain 60 feet in elevation. So it can be kind of small but fairly steep. That would be one set of slope groups. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1751)|
| 0:29:18| second set of slope groups is five acres and gaining 40 feet of elevation. And I'll say that we are probably one of the few, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| any, agency in the country that's going to try to look at elevation gain in defining what slopes are. Now, the other part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1764)|
| 0:29:34| equation, the piece that's missing, is the ridge tops are not covered under our existing sector plans in the slope protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| areas. That's because we're using slope only. Slopes, they become less steep at the top of the slope. It becomes flat, in fact. So we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| want to enclose the ridge tops. And we're introducing a new function that I'll show you real quickly here. The colors aren't going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1785)|
| 0:29:56| to show up real good on the overhead screen but you hopefully can see it on your monitor. The areas in red are slopes exceeding 15%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| along Black Oak Ridge in North Knox County. The areas in magenta are the ones that meet the criteria to become a slope group. In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1801)|
| 0:30:09| other words, they have the elevation gain requirement and they have the size requirement. So you see some of the areas in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| red fall away. They aren't included anymore. The watershed function is a function that says what's uphill of the slope groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1815)|
| 0:30:22| that have been defined. And that's basically what closes in the ridge tops. So this is the new model countywide. This is what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1822)|
| 0:30:32| model looks like. It is more than the current sector plan slope protection areas. I don't deny it. But remember, we're only covering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| about a quarter to a third of the slopes exceeding 15% in these hand-lineated areas. We're going to be covering more area. But I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1837)|
| 0:30:47| focus in on two particular sectors to show you what the net effect of this new model would be. And that is in North City and West City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| sectors. These are plans that were adopted around 2006-ish, I believe. The data sets that were used in this is our KGIS elevation data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| It's our local data sets derived with lasers and airplanes getting elevations every five feet. There would be hundreds of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1859)|
| 0:31:11| elevation measurements taken just in this room with this process. Highly reliable. I'm focusing in on these two because it's an apples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1871)|
| 0:31:21| to apples comparison in terms of the data that we would use to delineate the new hillside and ridge top protection area. If you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| these two sectors, the percentage change from the old process, two acre slope group size, to the new process, three to five acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1887)|
| 0:31:33| slope group size, and enclosing the ridge tops with the watershed function only increases the coverage area by 6%. Now, in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1893)|
| 0:31:41| hand-lineated sectors, it may appear like a blanket that we're throwing over the county. But in the sectors where we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| comparable data sets, it's not. It's a slight increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| So back to the second aspect of the rezoning process, and that is in the formulation of the staff recommendation, is specifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1912)|
| 0:32:01| dwelling unit density. We're going to walk through the process whereby that is done today and show you how the process would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| changed. There's no change to the procedure for recommending site density as a result of adopting this plan. The process is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1927)|
| 0:32:15| exactly the same when you're recommending density inside planned residential zones. For zero to 15% slopes, there is no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1935)|
| 0:32:22| change. The maximum dwelling unit density is in the third column there, three dwelling units per acre. This is for just an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1942)|
| 0:32:29| example we're going to run through. Three dwelling units per acre. That can vary. It's base zoning. It's compatible zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| To some degree, it's going to be dependent upon the request of the developer. So that can vary. But we're going to show you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1955)|
| 0:32:42| how this process works with the assumption of three dwelling units per acre. So we have a 100-acre site. It's broken down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| into three slope categories. Zero to 15% is 50 acres of the site or 50% of the site. 15 to 25% is 25% of the site and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1968)|
| 0:33:00| So this is the way the math works when we're recommending density to the Planning Commission and to the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| 50 acres times three dwelling units per acre is 150 dwelling units. So in essence, it's kind of a credit system that we utilize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| 15 to 25 is 25 times two is another 50 dwelling units. Same for the 25% and above. The dwelling units is .5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=1992)|
| 0:33:22| You sum up the dwelling units. You get 212 dwelling units on 100 acres. It would be a density recommendation of PR at 2.1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2002)|
| 0:33:30| dwelling units per acre. That's a process that's been in place since 2003 with the adoption of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| This plan proposes a slight change. No change below 40%, however. Below 40% is unchanged as a result of this plan. Above 40%, the task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2016)|
| 0:33:47| force recommended two new slope classes and that is 40 to 50%. They recommended a slight reduction in the dwelling unit density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| from .5 to .25 dwelling units per acre and above 50% no dwelling units per acre. So there's a slight change to this credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2033)|
| 0:34:00| system that we have in place for recommending density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| So very quickly, just to show you how this impacts density recommendations. This is a 190 acre site in East Knox County. It's got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2046)|
| 0:34:15| some significant slopes on the back portion on the north half of it. South half of it, not as sloped. It's an area that's receiving a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2055)|
| 0:34:24| of PR rezoning. This is the hillside and ridgetop protection area on the site. It's primarily concentrated on the back half of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| And this is the result of the formula I just showed you, this credit system. Under the current procedure for this site, we would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2070)|
| 0:34:40| recommending 2.22 dwelling units per acre under our planned residential rezoning. Under the new process, the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2080)|
| 0:34:47| recommendation would actually be 20 units higher and it would be 2.32 dwelling units per acre. So the staff recommendation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| higher under this plan. So why is that the case? Well, the reason for that is that the plan is designed to address the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| slope analysis. I showed you the old geography that we have for the sector plans. And I showed you how dismal it is. We don't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2099)|
| 0:35:05| reliable means to constrain the slope analysis procedures that we do to only the steeply sloped portions of the site. We have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2105)|
| 0:35:13| it for the entire parcel because we don't have a good means to delineate it. With this new model, with the new delineation process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| that we have, we can do slope analysis only on the steeply sloped portions of the site. And as a result, areas that are steeply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2119)|
| 0:35:29| sloped but may be less steeply sloped but are less significant are not included in the slope analysis calculation. So in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2129)|
| 0:35:36| instance, the developer would receive a higher dwelling unit recommendation than they would under our existing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2136)|
| 0:35:44| And then real quickly, I just want to close with three points in three minutes more or less. At the previous workshop, the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was raised in some livability rankings it had obtained from the economists. It's the most livable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| community in the country according to the economists. And I think Mr. Edwards pointed out at that time that if Pittsburgh didn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2156)|
| 0:36:06| steep slopes or slope development, there wouldn't be a Pittsburgh. But the fact is that Pittsburgh has open space and hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2166)|
| 0:36:15| zoning that cover 30% of the city of Pittsburgh. So they have protections in place to ensure good development and preservation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| open space. There may be a connection between livability, good planning, good development, and good development practices. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2181)|
| 0:36:32| second thing we wanted to do is revisit a slide that we showed you at the last presentation which could have been built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| Frequently, the points are raised that the projects couldn't have been built because they're in the hillside and ridgetop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2198)|
| 0:36:45| protection area. Maybe to some extent, that's maybe a misunderstanding of the plan that anything that's within the hillside and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| ridgetop protection area can't have anything built in it at all. Obviously, that's not the case. It certainly can be. But we wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2210)|
| 0:36:57| point out two particular projects and ask a different question. Let's look at Sequoia Hills and Holston Hills and ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| What can't be built under the existing regulations that we have today? Holston Hills, Sequoia Hills, Forest Hills. These older| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2223)|
| 0:37:11| hillside type developments that we have in the city, I think that everyone can agree, are good developments, can't be built because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2231)|
| 0:37:17| the development standards that we have in place that require 60 foot right of ways and 26 feet of pavement. This plan recommends a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2237)|
| 0:37:27| standard and it's an alternative development standard for hillside development, not a prohibition of development inside the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2247)|

| 0:42:01| but we don't want anything else that is necessary to reach that goal. Pitiful is the best word I can think of. Which brings us to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2521)|
| 0:42:08| newest and greatest version of the restriction of land, a proposal before us today, championed by the same status who want to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| yet another impediment to development and job creation in our community, all in the name of that most holy and hallowed purpose of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2534)|

| 0:42:38| capital will only be willing to invest if such risks are rewarded. And that's what we're going to do today. We're going to make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| city of Knoxville a better place. Almost every developer in this community has lost money in the last four years. Risk is the one factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| that no one in government or the regulatory world takes into account when they propose new rules and regulations. We are now reaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2569)|
| 0:42:57| what we have sown for years. Businesses are moving offshore for many reasons, but not the least of which are burdensome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| regulations such as OSHA, TOSHA, workers' comp insurance, threats of lawsuits, taxes, labor laws, and the list goes on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| We have enough regulation governing the development of property. Nothing needs to be added. And if you take the argument that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2589)|
| 0:43:17| presented here, nothing's going to change if we add this, so why do it? I repeat, nothing needs to be added. You will fundamentally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2597)|
| 0:43:24| change the value of land in the county for many. Developers will be unwilling to pay current market prices for land if the use of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2604)|
| 0:43:30| land is seriously hindered. I can hear the counter arguments now. We are not prohibiting the development of land. We are just wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2610)|
| 0:43:36| to do it more responsibly. Hogwash. We have what is now more than enough regulation. Leave it alone and throw this misguided proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2616)|

| 0:44:12| Well, tough act to follow. I'm Robin Askew, and I'm here to speak on behalf of the chamber. I am a lawyer and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2652)|
| 0:44:21| real estate developer. I want to point out first that we as the chamber appreciate the work of the task force. We know that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2661)|
| 0:44:30| been a long process. We know that you have had public meetings, and we recognize the fact that this is a passion for many, many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2670)|
| 0:44:38| people, and we appreciate that. We also desperately agree with the need to protect the ridgetops. If you look at the purple on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| map up there, that's what needs to be protected. The plan that's been proposed by MPC goes too far, in our opinion, in trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2683)|
| 0:44:58| protect ridgetops. If you look at what laws are already on the books now, and I think each of you have a copy of a letter here from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2698)|
| 0:45:06| chamber, but I just want to point out, because this is important, and it goes to what the gentleman was just saying about the laws that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| on the books, we have an urban growth plan in place now that already deals with slopes greater than 15%. It already includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2712)|
| 0:45:20| incentives for cluster development. It includes recommendations for overlay zones. We have a general growth plan. That includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2720)|
| 0:45:27| long-range planning for preservation of ridges, trees, and vegetation. It recommends creation of urban forestry, and it provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2727)|
| 0:45:35| standards for the development of hillsides and streams. We have sector plans. Again, it includes protection for slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2735)|
| 0:45:41| over 15%. We have a city and county tree and preservation and placing plan. In addition, the state TDEC requires if you disturb any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2741)|
| 0:45:51| land greater than one acre, you have to get an NPDES permit and a stormwater permit. These are already in place. Our city code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2751)|
| 0:46:00| requires a grading permit for clearing. Knox County code requires a grading permit for sites greater than one acre, and it imposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| height restrictions. We have subdivision regulations in place. We could stand here and go point by point on what was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2766)|
| 0:46:17| presented, but that's not appropriate at this time, mainly because of time, and I don't want to do that. But what I do want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2777)|
| 0:46:25| and what we understand this plan does, is it will recommend for any zoning change that we go to a planned zone. And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2785)|
| 0:46:35| I think your job as commissioners is to look at these planned zones. If you have a planned zone, that will require that MPC review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2795)|
| 0:46:44| everything that comes before it. And if you're going to pick up an additional third, you're going to increase the cost, a third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2804)|
| 0:46:53| of the land in Knoxville, to be reviewed. Where's the money going to come from? MPC's budget is already $4.3 million. And how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| is that going to be paid for? Are we going to have an increase in that budget? Are we going to increase fees? Because you cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2819)|
| 0:47:08| logically, despite what's been said, you cannot logically increase that much work on MPC without the money coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2828)|
| 0:47:16| somewhere. We have recommendations, and I apologize these pages aren't numbered, but we have recommendations. We ask you to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| the following. That you ask the existing city and county engineers, the traffic folks, and codes enforcement to look at this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2841)|
| 0:47:29| make recommendations and determine elevations. And mainly, once those determinations are made, notify people. You cannot, it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2849)|
| 0:47:40| just unconscionable to me personally, and at the chamber level, we believe you have to notify people that their property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2860)|
| 0:47:46| about to be impacted. Ask MPC to review height limitations on all existing Knox County zoning classifications. Consider increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2866)|
| 0:47:59| enforcement. As we mentioned, you've already got all these laws on the books. A lot of the things that are causing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2879)|
| 0:48:06| heartburn are simply because our existing codes aren't being enforced. And then finally, we would ask that you look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2886)|
| 0:48:16| overall, vote this plan down and send it back to MPC for consideration of the things that we just listed. Finally, I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2896)|
| 0:48:25| ask again, I think we saw a minute ago, but we have the Home Builders Association and the realtors here, and I said this in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2905)|
| 0:48:33| meeting last week. We are the people who have to come before you and before MPC to deal with these regulations. And they're here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| because this impacts their jobs. And it impacts the economy of our city and our county. And we know what we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2919)|
| 0:48:51| about. We have to use the system. And I would ask once again that those who are opposed to this plan in its present form to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2931)|
| 0:48:57| stand and just let you know that this is important. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| Do we have anyone else that would like to speak? We have a few more minutes left, and then I want to start getting questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=2942)|

| 0:50:15| the Tree Board. We've talked about it every month throughout the three years it's been going on. The Tree Board has created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| ordinance in the city of Knoxville to advise and to protect trees within the city. And, of course, as we know, the city lies wholly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3021)|
| 0:50:32| within the county. So the Tree Board feels that our recommendation should also be made to you all as county commission and should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3032)|
| 0:50:41| extend to the whole county. There are no tree protection ordinances for the county. The city of Knoxville currently is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3041)|
| 0:50:50| in the process of finishing up a tree inventory, and some of the data has been gathered, recommendations are being made, and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3050)|
| 0:51:00| are some very disturbing things that have already come to light within the tree inventory. We don't have a lot of large trees. A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3060)|
| 0:51:09| lot of the large trees that we have are in bad shape. Without any tree protection and with a lot of the building activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| taking place in the county, then the tree loss in the county is higher than it is in the city, which is already in very dismal shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3075)|
| 0:51:29| Trees provide a lot of environmental benefits, stormwater retention, air quality. They increase property value and they need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3089)|
| 0:51:34| protected. This plan does that. It's been said over and over, if this plan doesn't do anything, then what's the point? Well, what this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3094)|
| 0:51:52| does, speaking as a task force member, is it represents a lot of work. We spend a lot of time evaluating a lot of data to be able to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3112)|
| 0:51:58| recommendations to you all. If you feel like that some of these recommendations we've reached an error, then I would encourage you to spend an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3118)|

| 0:52:21| And then finally, I want to turn my hat around a little and speak as UT Extension agent here in Knox County. I want to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3141)|

| 0:54:10| live there. We keep hearing about these density bonuses. The problem with the density bonuses is not everybody wants to live in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3250)|
| 0:54:16| zero lot line situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3256)|
| 0:54:26| One of the things that we can sell here in East Tennessee is the fact that we have beautiful areas. We have beautiful trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3266)|
| 0:54:33| We have beautiful developments like Lovell Hills and Concord Hills, which you can say that these developments could be built under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| these standards. And you could even have more properties, but they would not look like they look. They just wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3279)|
| 0:54:48| And if we want to put a product out there that people can choose how they want to live, developers don't want to ruin a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3288)|
| 0:54:56| development. Aesthetically and keeping trees and keeping things look good is aesthetically pleasing. Trees are renewable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3296)|
| 0:55:02| They grow. One of the reasons why Sequoia Hills and these developments are so sought after now is because, hey, they've had a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3302)|
| 0:55:10| years for those trees to come back. Developers want trees. We want greenery. We want developments that look good. We don't need this to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3310)|
| 0:55:19| do those developments. They've already been done. So don't be disingenuous about the fact that there's no changes over 40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3319)|
| 0:55:25| percent. The question I have for MPC is that if you can do the same amount of units, theoretically, are there changes in the amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3325)|
| 0:55:36| area that can be disturbed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| We are, sir, this is not an opportunity for you to ask questions. You can make a comment if you'd like. I'll jot it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| Well, my contention is there are severe restrictions on the amount of area that can be disturbed. So on the one hand, you can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3346)|
| 0:55:54| hey, you can have the same number of units, but if you can only disturb 15 percent of the area, you can't do it. It's not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3354)|
| 0:56:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| We have time for one more speaker, and then we're going to yes, sir, you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3366)|
| 0:56:12| Excuse me. My name is James Kelly Clancy. I'm a realtor. I live at 376 Dominion Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3372)|
| 0:56:18| Just one point in particular, Mr. Vandergriff mentioned that there's a few members from the tree board that served in the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3378)|
| 0:56:29| I don't know what the composition of the task force was, but I dare say if you had more realtors, builders, and developers, you probably had a more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3389)|
| 0:56:38| balanced view. And it does impact us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| We're environmentalists like Jeff Grebe was saying. We want to see trees. We don't want trees cut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| And as the one lady had mentioned, spoke on behalf of the chamber, is enforce what's currently on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3409)|
| 0:56:58| Mr. Vandergriff mentioned how some people don't do what's supposed to be done. If they're not doing what they're supposed to be doing, enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3418)|
| 0:57:05| Period. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| What I'd like to do now is to give our commissioners the opportunity to ask questions. We want to start in the first district with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| Commissioner McKenzie. We're going to try to hold to around ten minutes. If you need more time, we want to be respectful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3436)|
| 0:57:22| But each commissioner will have an opportunity to ask questions. So we'll start with you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I don't know if I'll take all ten minutes or not. I won't set my course on that. I just want to ask a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3447)|
| 0:57:33| But before I do that, I listened to both sides of it. So I have a couple, I guess, statements and maybe a question. But primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3453)|
| 0:57:47| statements. And that's really a charge to both sides. This is a contentious issue. We recognize that. We realize that. But there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| some things, I guess, I just need to get off of my chest and side of the mic, I'll do that at this point. People talk about cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3472)|
| 0:58:06| In the same conversations about this cost thing, I know we were taxed crazy sometimes, very tax adverse, and I understand that, and I'm as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3486)|
| 0:58:16| well, but you talk about cost on one end. It's going to take 300,000, it took 300,000 dollars to build this building. It's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| take 300,000 dollars for this plan. But we want to spend more money to send mailers out. I want to do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| So quit bringing up cost, in my humble opinion. Quit bringing up cost to serve your side of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3508)|
| 0:58:35| The cost is the cost. If we're concerned about our ridges and slope tops for development or for preservation, it's going to cost money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3515)|
| 0:58:43| Let's quit bringing up the cost. We here in East Tennessee are conservative. We're going to be conservative. Both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3523)|
| 0:58:49| Democrat, Republican, Independent, we're conservative people. So let's stop dragging cost into this equation. The cost is the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3529)|
| 0:58:57| If you want a quality plan, it's going to take time, it's going to take money. Same with the three years. Okay, it took three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3537)|
| 0:59:05| That's not, you know, something to champion in 40 meetings, 100 meetings, the time is the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3545)|
| 0:59:12| Similar with the make up. And I'll say this happened early into my career. I had a job. I had a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3552)|
| 0:59:18| I spent a lot of time on this commission. But the process within county commission, and someone correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| we had a choice to who we wanted to appoint to this board. So I don't think it was skewed from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3564)|
| 0:59:32| Okay, maybe there was some interest that needed to be on the board, but the majority of the people were chosen by city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3572)|
| 0:59:40| county commissioners. And me personally, I didn't get a lot of builders within my district or preservationists within my district that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3580)|
| 0:59:48| suggest clamoring to be on the committee. So as I think Commissioner Norman said, it wasn't an issue in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3588)|
| 0:59:55| It's an issue now. So let's not beat up the committee for its make up and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| And, you know, the first gentleman talked about, and I agree with everything he said as it relates to the failures that we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3600)|
| 1:00:09| especially Midway being one. But we didn't have that. From the chamber, we didn't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| From the developers, we didn't have the passion as much as the other, and I voted for Midway, so just to let you know where I'm coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3615)|
| 1:00:24| from, as the other side did. So, you know, I think it's a shame that we haven't, that we have a grand site out there that we're going to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3624)|
| 1:00:33| go to whatever it's going to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| The last thing, and this is, I guess, cost related, too, you know, I try to go back to the first group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3639)|
| 1:00:47| So what started this process? And what started this process were a few developments that we drove by there, the staunchest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3647)|
| 1:00:57| development property rights person would look at it and say, that's ugly. That's a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3657)|
| 1:01:02| That and the water tower, that's ugly. That's a shame. I mean, there's some, you know, black and white,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3662)|
| 1:01:08| white issues. I could take you to some ones that are, you know, no one would argue about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| And so what am I saying? You know, as I've talked to folks about it, and several folks probably heard me say this, police yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| I think we wouldn't be here. I think the book, the laws on the books would be okay if you police yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3679)|
| 1:01:27| If you saw these developments going up in a haphazard fashion, funding whichever, I don't care why, but at the end of the day, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3687)|
| 1:01:33| you saw those, I think the organizations, if they policed themselves, we wouldn't be having this difficult conversation today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3693)|
| 1:01:43| Similar with storm water. You know, storm water rules were on the books, but we had to make them a little tougher prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| our coming in to get folks to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| So if you're not going to police yourselves, we're only left to pass laws and ordinances, I'm not saying that's what this is, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3713)|
| 1:01:59| take care of, you know, the tip of your nose as it relates to what flows downhill or what folks see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| And the answer I've gotten back from that is, what's Knox County's job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| You only have two enforcement folks. Okay. So yes, you're right. Are we going to raise taxes to enforce this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3730)|
| 1:02:18| There are going to be some difficult conversations about this. Okay. So if it's an enforcement process, we need to hire some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| people, that's a tax stream. You know, that's a revenue stream that we don't have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| So think about the fullness of this conversation. At the end of the day, we're going to be left with something. And I'll tell both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3749)|
| 1:02:37| sides. I mean, I don't, me personally, I don't see it standing the way it stands today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3757)|
| 1:02:44| By that same token, we need something, or we'll continue to see the developments, and I will say, I'm not saying all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| I mean, it's a percentage, a small number in terms of percentages, but they do stand out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3770)|
| 1:03:00| Question for Mr. Kuhn, I guess in terms of, I need to understand, and you went into it some, this hand delineated versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3780)|
| 1:03:13| pixel process. Yeah, maybe it's the second slide I'd like to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| Second or third slide that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| And my question is, it's more of a detailed question. I understand, and it is significant in terms of the added space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3804)|
| 1:03:32| especially in the county, it looks like. And I understand that that's because we hadn't done much, as much in the counties and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3812)|
| 1:03:39| city as, you know, as far as the hand delineation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| But my question is, okay, with GIS, is it strictly aerial photos that you're using? Are you doing, are you mapping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3824)|
| 1:03:55| You talked about the quality, the superiority as it relates to the GIS process, pixel process, as opposed to the hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3835)|
| 1:04:04| process based on contour maps probably generated, you know, decades ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| So could you go into that in a little more detail for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| Sure. I mean, I would equate the hand process to what we have on the wall here. It's art. It's not science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| And we're trying to bring a process that is really based on science, transparency, and objectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3859)|
| 1:04:24| You know, this is a good example. This art right here on the wall doesn't include six of the named ridges in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| It doesn't include Brown Mountain. It doesn't include Copper Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| We have the subjective nature of this delineation process by hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| When you bring it into GIS and you have a process that you can conduct uniformly across the county using the KGIS elevation data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3879)|
| 1:04:45| it dramatically improves what we're able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| The data itself is captured. It's been captured two times now, in 2003 and in 2007 and 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| Half of the county was captured each of those times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| The airplane uses something called LIDAR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| And LIDAR is a process whereby a laser is shot down to the ground from the airplane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| Nobody's injured. Nobody's damaged. No property's damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| But the laser is returned up to the airplane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| It calculates the amount of time that it took for it to get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| and elevation can be determined vertically within about six inches of what its actual elevation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3925)|
| 1:05:33| And horizontally, those things are within two or three inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| So it's a very precise means of delineating, giving good elevation continuously across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| Then we can take and manipulate that in various ways to delineate slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3943)|
| 1:05:48| So I'm sorry, but I want to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| Are you shooting beams every foot, yard, quarter mile?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| Yeah, the resolution isn't precise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| It's basically a laser that sweeps back and forth at a very high speed, and it's hitting everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| It's hitting trees. It's hitting all sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| And the amount of the light beam that gets back to it determines what's really the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| Now with GIS, what we can do is take those individual points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| and interpolate between them to arrive at what the elevation...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| We look at it on a pixel basis, but basically what we're doing is we're interpolating all of those different points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3988)|
| 1:06:33| to arrive at a single elevation for a pixel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| The finest level of resolution of elevation that we have is a pixel every five feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| That's what we do because it introduces too many small little variations and ridges that are really insignificant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| So what we do is we try to essentially dumb the data down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| We decrease its resolution to about 25 feet, so 25 feet per cell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| And that's compared to what you can get from federal data, 30 meters per cell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| That's what we started out, 30 meters, calculating elevation once every 30 meters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4023)|
| 1:07:08| That doesn't mean that you're calculating it every 300 feet. We're calculating it every 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| Okay, and I guess in terms of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| Could you talk a little bit about... This isn't new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| I mean, it's probably a decade old or something like that or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4043)|
| 1:07:28| Is this process the generally accepted process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| that countries outside of the U.S., the U.S. states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| is this what people use to map land formations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| Yes, this is the state of the practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| It's a process that emerged in the early 2000s is when this process really became| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| something that people could use on a large scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| So this is... And there's standards, I'm assuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| There's a set of... They're called photogrammetric standards, and there's a society that sets the standards for large-scale mapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| And our data conforms to and meets the standards for large-scale mapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| I guess my last question, and I'll move it along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| is more maybe for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| And I'd like to get an answer from someone from the chamber and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| someone today, because you all both brought up Pittsburgh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4113)|
| 1:08:38| I've driven into Pittsburgh, and I understand what they deal with in terms of their land formations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| And we've seen it on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4123)|
| 1:08:48| Again, these sound bites, we've kind of come a generation of sound bites, both sides, I'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4128)|
| 1:08:55| What I think I heard was from someone from the chamber said you couldn't do a Pittsburgh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4135)|
| 1:09:03| and then someone from MPC or KGIS say that 30% of Pittsburgh complies with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4143)|
| 1:09:09| Is the truth, and this is just a general question, please discuss as much or as little as you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4149)|
| 1:09:19| is the truth that you couldn't build a new Pittsburgh, so the chamber's right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4159)|
| 1:09:26| that you could not build a brand-new Pittsburgh green field today with this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4166)|
| 1:09:32| And the answer on the other side is they kind of realize that at some point in their lifetime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4172)|
| 1:09:38| hey, we've got to clamp down on this, so that's why 30% of them is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4178)|
| 1:09:43| So I just want to get the answer on the great city of Pittsburgh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4183)|
| 1:09:50| Really, when you pull into Pittsburgh, and I hope you get a chance to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| because it really is a pretty cool town, it is in a bowl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| And it's 360 degrees surrounded by, it's like you're in Cades Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| And they have developed on those elevations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| Our point is this, that they did develop there as we have developed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4210)|
| 1:10:20| We have all the ordinances, all of the policies that are in place today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4220)|
| 1:10:27| to do exactly what this plan is saying to do under 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4227)|
| 1:10:35| Over 40%, we believe, is important to take a look at because there needs to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4235)|
| 1:10:43| we think that that needs to be go back and really look at it because there's some value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| But everything at 40% and below, we're really talking about you've already got all your ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4248)|
| 1:10:59| In our recommendation, we believe that the county needs to adopt a tree policy that is more beefed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4259)|
| 1:11:07| And you can tweak these ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| When you talk about other cities, though, you really got to read the entire deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4271)|
| 1:11:17| Like in Asheville, they, too, have slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4277)|
| 1:11:25| But it doesn't start until it gets to a certain elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| And you, in order to understand simplistically, well, let me put it another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4288)|
| 1:11:36| You can't understand it simplistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| What you can do is look at Pittsburgh and understand that they have been able to achieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4299)|
| 1:11:45| probably with ordinances and very much like ours, a very livable, great city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4305)|
| 1:11:53| All we have to do is enforce the ordinances that we currently have, and we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4313)|
| 1:12:05| Does anybody see one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| I don't know if you want to say something as it relates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| The thing that can be said is that Pittsburgh is doing some really neat things right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4330)|
| 1:12:18| And they're doing it within an environment that is aggressively protective of their hillsides and ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4338)|
| 1:12:25| Okay, so it's kind of as I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| And my last question to NBC is, and I know it's hard to predict the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4348)|
| 1:12:34| and how this body will and your governing body will use, say this plan is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4354)|
| 1:12:45| What we talked about is no ordinances and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| But if it's a plan, is it going to be referred to in the approval or denial of projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4368)|
| 1:12:56| I know it will be in the sense that because it doesn't meet this, it's going to be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4376)|
| 1:13:06| And I know we can override things and there's processes and rebuttals that can take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4386)|
| 1:13:14| But I'm just trying to get a feel for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| Everyone says it's a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| It's a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| I think they're selling it a little short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| I think as evidenced by this and subsequent meetings, it's going to be more than just a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4401)|
| 1:13:27| I guess is what I'm trying to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| Are you all going to use this plan as more than just a good idea, as this is the standard by which we're going to move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4409)|
| 1:13:40| And if the answer is yes, I'm not making it like it's a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| I just want to get a sense of how we're going to be dealing with this plan as it relates to how my vote is going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4423)|
| 1:13:50| and as I develop my thoughts on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4430)|
| 1:13:56| Thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| There are several ways that MPC staff and the planning commission itself can utilize the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4437)|
| 1:14:05| One is the way that we currently use our slope protection areas and stream protection areas in adopting staff recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4445)|
| 1:14:14| that we make on proposed rezoning cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| Currently, the policies that are in place recommend the use of planned zones when you have slope protection and stream protection areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4458)|
| 1:14:27| So we make that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| Currently, we have a set of factors that we use to recommend a density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| We would use the new policies the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4475)|
| 1:14:40| We currently have language in plans that guide us when we review the development plans that are associated with planned zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4480)|
| 1:14:48| in making our staff recommendation and working with the developer as he works through the process of getting a site plan approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4488)|
| 1:14:55| That will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| So we would use the plan much the same way that we currently use all of the existing policy and geography that's in our plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4498)|
| 1:15:09| The new part is the recommendations about perhaps new ordinances and new regulations that could be put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4509)|
| 1:15:17| and we would work at the behest of the legislative bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| should they desire to go down a path of perhaps picking out several elements of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4522)|
| 1:15:29| and a number of recommendations and pursuing ordinances to implement that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4529)|
| 1:15:35| That could be initiated by the legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| We prefer that so that we have some indication that something will get done when the planning commission gets done operating on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4538)|
| 1:15:46| A planning commission itself can initiate a proposed ordinance or regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4546)|
| 1:15:52| at the risk of having it thrown in the wastebasket at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4552)|
| 1:15:58| But the plan serves as a roadmap for future work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4558)|
| 1:16:06| as well as a set of principles and policies to be applied to existing work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4566)|
| 1:16:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| I'm sort of torn between trying to wait until the end and go ahead and make some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4581)|
| 1:16:28| I guess I'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| Of course, I don't have a whole lot of questions for the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| I do understand the plan fairly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4595)|
| 1:16:41| I greatly appreciate Mr. McKenzie's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4601)|
| 1:16:45| They're always very well thought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4605)|
| 1:16:51| I guess without being too repetitive, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| some of the comments that disturb when folks come to the microphone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4615)|
| 1:17:01| and they use words like restrictions and regulations and things like those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4621)|
| 1:17:08| those are fairly incendiary comments because it's just not so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4628)|
| 1:17:14| It's not a restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| It's not a regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| It's a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| So we keep saying that, but it's really hard for people to digest that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| Now, the consideration, though, and the fear, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4645)|
| 1:17:31| sort of comes from the fact that if a fairly large thing like this plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4651)|
| 1:17:38| and it's fairly comprehensive, gets into place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| does it automatically promote the regulation and co-change automatically ensue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4662)|
| 1:17:55| Now, what I'd say is no, and we have some very good examples of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4675)|
| 1:18:01| And Asheville is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| Now, I've heard some people say Asheville is a hemp-based society or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4684)|
| 1:18:13| It's a very successful city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| It's a very, very nice place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| The Grove Park Inn is doing pretty good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| and the hillside behind it is doing really, really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4705)|
| 1:18:30| And the people that are on this task force and that are in this staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4710)|
| 1:18:37| that have done this work would go amen to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| We like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| That's some good stuff right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| Now, Asheville doesn't have, they don't have hillside regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4727)|
| 1:18:53| They don't have hillside code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| They've done that without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| Now, I would love to see a change, and Mr. McKenzie said police yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4739)|
| 1:19:07| and I say police, police yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| because if we had people in our development community policing themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| we wouldn't be here, and this meeting would not be necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| because I think we all want basically the same things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4762)|
| 1:19:27| We want good development, and we want to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| in the words of my farmer friend from Loudoun County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4770)|
| 1:19:34| we want to get shed a bad development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4774)|
| 1:19:38| And we know it when we see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| It's really hard to delineate, you know, by code, and what can we do, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4781)|
| 1:19:48| to prevent that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| That's really, really hard to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| So I hope that policing thing really becomes something that we do consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4793)|
| 1:20:00| and it has to take place within the development community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| And we have these wonderful developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| You know, when I think of good development, I mean, I think of Mike Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| He's a good developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| He does good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| Tim Zitzman, John Huber, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4818)|
| 1:20:23| But we know we've got some rascals too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4823)|
| 1:20:28| and nobody knows them better than the development community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| And so I hope policing is something we do consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4833)|
| 1:20:39| But it doesn't take, there is no logical step to assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4839)|
| 1:20:46| that this plan is going to result in regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4846)|
| 1:20:51| The chamber just recommended some changes in code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| We're not recommending any changes in code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| But if it goes that way, guess who's going to be invited to the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4858)|
| 1:21:04| We want the realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| We want the Home Builders Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| We want all the people that are concerned with land practice in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| to be at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4875)|
| 1:21:16| We thought we had them there in the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| Now there's been, obviously, some problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| That happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4883)|
| 1:21:29| But I'd like to say in a perfect world, an idealistic world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4889)|
| 1:21:36| this plan would pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| and a philosophic change in development in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| would take place to the extent that we'd kind of be like Asheville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4903)|
| 1:21:49| We wouldn't need any zoning, I mean any code or regulatory apparatus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4909)|
| 1:21:56| Wouldn't that be nice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| I think it would be really, really interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| and progressive for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| Commissioner Oldby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4927)|
| 1:22:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| Thank you very much, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4936)|
| 1:22:24| This, I've read this plan several times since August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4944)|
| 1:22:30| and I didn't get involved in it until August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| because just like the public, I didn't know as a regular citizen what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| I didn't know about the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| If they were posted, I didn't see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| Maybe they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| I'm not saying that they weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| But the vast majority of the public has not known about this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4968)|
| 1:22:55| And I've got to, I don't mean to bring up the cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| but two changes in three years in this plan at $350,000 is not a good investment to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4981)|
| 1:23:17| I think it's not being a good steward of our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| And, yes, plans do cost money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| and we do need to get out there and look at these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5001)|
| 1:23:26| But if these plans, if these slope protections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| this 15 percent is already on the books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| which is the big topic for the developers is the 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5013)|
| 1:23:41| If it's already on the books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| then why did we even go into the task force of going into redoing this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5022)|
| 1:23:50| or redoing the codes or the zones on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5030)|
| 1:23:57| And that comes to a question, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| Is there any policies already in the works if this plan is approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| I know Commissioner Anders asked this last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| and it was kind of insinuated, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| there's already some sitting there waiting so that when this is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5053)|
| 1:24:18| you are going to come back to us for approval on some zoning changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5058)|
| 1:24:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| The plan makes many recommendations that could be codified through new ordinances or regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5068)|
| 1:24:35| We would prefer that those be initiated by the legislative bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5075)|
| 1:24:41| but there are several that we would recommend that we get started on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5081)|
| 1:24:46| should the plan be adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| and one would be some requirements about revegetation of disturbed areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5088)|
| 1:24:54| and creating some standards for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| That would be, in our mind, a relatively easy one to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| The plan, if adopted, would replace our old school slope protection areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5104)|
| 1:25:11| with a new scientifically generated set of geography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| That is a significant improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| The plan does add ridgetops to our existing sloped areas, slope protection areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5118)|
| 1:25:28| That was one of the charges to the task force is to address ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5128)|
| 1:25:36| The plan makes a set of recommendations on alternative development standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| for developing within the hillside areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| and that would be another set of regulations that ought to be pursued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5144)|
| 1:25:49| We ought not to try to force very suburban road standards, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5149)|
| 1:25:56| into a hillside area with 50-foot right-of-ways and 26-foot cross-sections on pavement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5156)|
| 1:26:03| and big, broad minimum radiuses on curves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5163)|
| 1:26:10| We ought to make that possible without the need to get a variance from those regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5170)|
| 1:26:18| So technically we already have some that are in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5178)|
| 1:26:23| Commissioner, can I expand on that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5183)|
| 1:26:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| Sorry, I leaned into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| But if you look at the appendices of the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5198)|
| 1:26:42| there's a conservation subdivision ordinance that has been drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| That took time, obviously, in looking around the country as to what places have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| We looked at parking standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| We know that retail is way over-parked in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| But when you're putting in five spaces in the county in a larger parking stall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5216)|
| 1:27:02| it's going to result in carving into hillsides when it's a hillside-related development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5222)|
| 1:27:08| And in the case of the technology corridor, we already, during the course of this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5228)|
| 1:27:14| put in alternative guidelines for reducing parking to have a minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| and a maximum at the choice of the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| That was part of this work as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| Finally, Mark mentioned the road standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| We've teed that up, ready to go with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| and we're looking at a revision of subdivision regulations already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5248)|
| 1:27:38| That goes back to basically the question that this is more than a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5258)|
| 1:27:44| I mean, if I question, I understand the reduction of streets in subdivisions as a way of helping the developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5264)|
| 1:27:58| but to me that seems more dangerous for the citizens to have a more narrow road than what we currently have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5278)|
| 1:28:07| if I'm understanding that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| The point on that is that in very low-density situations, which this would probably apply 15% up to 40% or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5291)|
| 1:28:21| narrow roads can work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| We see it in Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| We see it in Forest Heights where 20 feet works well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5305)|
| 1:28:31| Asheville has 20-foot-wide roads with the utilities under the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5311)|
| 1:28:37| Working with the engineers that were on the task force in the utility districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| they wanted to have the option of putting it outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| so we went with the recommendation of a 40-foot right-of-way with 20 feet of pavement would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5324)|
| 1:28:54| I have a real issue with this plan and not the 15%, although I am concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5334)|
| 1:29:01| I think that is too intrusive, even though it is already in play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| We're already using it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| My real issue with this is the devaluing of a person's property, which is what we're going to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5349)|
| 1:29:16| You're telling them that they cannot use that slope or that ridgetop on their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5356)|
| 1:29:23| and that's a property rights issue with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5363)|
| 1:29:33| I think a person that purchases a property, I purchase mine for where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5373)|
| 1:29:37| I live in West Hills, and there's nothing but hills in there, and my house is right on a slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5377)|
| 1:29:46| It did get flooded in February 28, but that's not because of how it was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5386)|
| 1:29:53| It was built in 1957.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| It's just floodwater's got to go somewhere, and through my basement is how it chose this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5395)|
| 1:30:02| I do have a problem with devaluing somebody's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| and I do have a problem with us telling what that person can do, whether cutting down a tree or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5406)|
| 1:30:15| I chose to cut them out of my yard because the limbs were falling on my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5415)|
| 1:30:19| I chose my house over my trees, and I'm sorry if that offends anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5419)|
| 1:30:24| It's not the purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| The purpose is to protect my family and my house that I purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| And that's about all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5431)|
| 1:30:42| I do have a lot of concerns about this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| I think it is overreaching and does step on the property rights of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5445)|
| 1:30:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5452)|
| 1:30:53| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| I'm going to make just a comment or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| and then I'm going to do something that no one's done up to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| I'm going to ask some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| But, you know, one of the things, and I'm going to make light of this just a little bit when we talk about Pittsburgh being the most livable city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5461)|
| 1:31:09| I just saw a thing in Forbes magazine last week about the ten best communities in the United States for retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5469)|
| 1:31:15| and some of you may have seen this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| And I think the number one city wouldn't make anyone's list if I gave you 200 cities to pick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| It was Fargo, North Dakota.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| So, you know, I don't put too much into these polls and recommended places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5485)|
| 1:31:30| Indianapolis, I think, was number three or four, so you have to put that all into perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5490)|
| 1:31:36| You know, one of the questions that I have, and we're talking about, you know, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| let me make the statement that I don't think we're as far apart as a lot of people think we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5502)|
| 1:31:48| If you think about what the ultimate goal of everyone is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| whether it's the people that develop this plan or the people that are against the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| or the people that are realtors or environmentalists or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| is that what we want to do ultimately is to stop some of the egregious things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5521)|
| 1:32:08| And we've had some of the largest developers in this county stand at the podium and say, you know, they don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| There's no one here likes it when there's a whole hilltop or a ridge or something that's taken off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5533)|
| 1:32:22| probably done very poorly when it's taken off, and then a developer goes broke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5542)|
| 1:32:28| and then it all washes down into a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| It's aesthetically not pleasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| It's potentially dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| It really hasn't accomplished anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| And I think everyone here wants to try to find a way to get to the point where those things don't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| I mean, I don't think there's anyone who would disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| You know, the problem is how to get there and what's the best way to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| Now I'm going to start asking questions after I made that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| What role does soil type play when the NPC looks at their recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5580)|
| 1:33:08| We've talked a lot about slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| I'm the black sheep of my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| I have almost every male engineer in my family for the past three generations has been a civil engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5592)|
| 1:33:21| And I've heard them talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| I haven't talked with any of my relatives about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| And this goes back to my grandfather, who was involved in the Panama Canal, and my brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| Even those that become doctors become civil engineers first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| But what is the role that soil type plays during the evaluation of the NPC looking at slopes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5615)|
| 1:33:41| We've talked about slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| We've talked about slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| What about soil type?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5623)|
| 1:33:52| If a case is within a slope protection area and it comes in for rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5632)|
| 1:33:58| or even if it is zoned with a base district and comes in for a concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5638)|
| 1:34:05| we will take the soil types into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| If we know that there are soils that are subject to slippage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5649)|
| 1:34:14| we will try to direct the applicant to plan around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5654)|
| 1:34:19| If we have a planned zone district within which to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5659)|
| 1:34:25| we can be much more flexible about that because we have flexibility as far as lot sizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5665)|
| 1:34:31| so we can literally keep density neutral while working around areas that have been identified with bad soils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5671)|
| 1:34:39| Typically, those soils that are subject to slippage are located on slopes that are greater than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5679)|
| 1:34:48| There's a strong correlation between the slope and the bad soil type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5688)|
| 1:34:54| So that was a strong factor in deciding in the first place to identify slope protection areas in all of our comprehensive planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5694)|
| 1:35:04| Just one other thing to add is that 90% of the county's high-slip soils are contained within the new hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5704)|
| 1:35:14| and ridgetop protection area that's been identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| The next question, and this is more just for my information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5717)|
| 1:35:21| we had the well-publicized situation a couple of years ago where there was an apartment building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5721)|
| 1:35:28| and the mud slid down on it and it was actually one of my physician colleagues who was very seriously injured there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5728)|
| 1:35:34| and I think you all know what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| What was the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5736)|
| 1:35:37| I'm asking, I don't know, what was the problem there that allowed that or permitted that to occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5737)|
| 1:35:43| Was it a zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| Was it a developmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| Was it an enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5746)|
| 1:35:47| I mean, what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| And I'm not pointing fingers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| Where did we fail, either in our zoning, our enforcement, or something that allowed something like that to occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5751)|
| 1:35:59| What happened there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| At that point in time, there was two failures in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| That particular one was fill that was improperly placed in a ravine and washed out during that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5766)|
| 1:36:16| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5776)|
| 1:36:17| The other one was on the apartments on the north face of Sharps Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5777)|
| 1:36:22| where the slope above that failed and came down toward the edge of the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5782)|
| 1:36:28| I mean, I realize that it failed, but did it fail because we didn't know it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| Did we permit that to occur because it was too close to a slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| Did we misjudge the soil?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| Was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5798)|
| 1:36:39| I mean, I know the slope failed, but why was it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| It could have been improper compaction of the slope, or it could have been, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5803)|
| 1:36:51| we pointed out the strip mining reclamation techniques which allow for pervious water to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5811)|
| 1:37:01| It was just a clearing of a slope that arguably may not have been necessary to be cleared at that density, but it did fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5821)|
| 1:37:13| The other comment that's going to lead to my next question is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5833)|
| 1:37:18| I know we've said to this community, you know, police yourself, police yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5838)|
| 1:37:24| I'm not really sure that that's completely the job of, you know, realtors and developers to go out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5844)|
| 1:37:31| and, you know, get a posse to go out there, a vendetta to go out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| and if something's not right to run someone off the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| I mean, that really is the role of government to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| It doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| It doesn't really work in trying to prevent bad development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| It doesn't work in trying to get rid of bad lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| It doesn't work in trying to get rid of bad doctors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| I mean, really, sometimes that's the government's job to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| And trying to get to this goal that we've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| and, of course, one pathway that's been proposed is what we're talking about here with these regulations and guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5885)|
| 1:38:14| But the other, rather than piling, you know, more and more guidelines, more and more codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5894)|
| 1:38:23| more and more rules on there, deals with enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| And sometimes we have plenty of laws, not just in this, but we have plenty of laws in this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5907)|
| 1:38:33| and piling more laws on doesn't help, but there's a question of enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5913)|
| 1:38:39| And, you know, my question is, and this may be something that the law director would have to respond to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5919)|
| 1:38:45| or it could be someone for the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| If you really ask me what I would like, and this may not make everyone in here happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| what I would really like to see is to have significant, a significant bond requirement when a project started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5932)|
| 1:39:02| And that's part of the condition of MPC or county commission approval, if it involves a zoning change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5942)|
| 1:39:08| that if a developer does go bankrupt or simply if something untoward where you have the best developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5948)|
| 1:39:16| with the best intentions trying to do everything correctly, and then we have a rain, like we had on February the 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5956)|
| 1:39:23| where something in his project causes damage, there's a way to compensate either the people that have been harmed by that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5963)|
| 1:39:33| or the communities that have been harmed by that, and part of the harm deals with maybe the destruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5973)|
| 1:39:41| or the washing away of the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| I have two questions about this, is that, one, are we restricted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5984)|
| 1:39:50| Is there something that this legislative body can do to put a bigger bond on a project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5990)|
| 1:39:59| Also, is there something this body can do when we do have flagrant and egregious code violations, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=5999)|
| 1:40:10| of our present codes that would put teeth into enforcement rather than having more new rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6010)|
| 1:40:15| is just try to enforce the rules that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| Can we do that or is that something that we're handcuffed by the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6018)|
| 1:40:26| By state law saying you cause $100,000 worth of damage, you get a $50 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6026)|
| 1:40:34| Is there anything we can do that makes people play by the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6034)|
| 1:40:40| I'll take a crack at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| In general, it is the legislative body that has the authority to adopt regulations and set budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6042)|
| 1:40:49| Through the regulations that are adopted, you can mandate bonds associated with the provision of public improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6049)|
| 1:41:01| and you can set budgets to create an enforcement body that's capable of doing their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6061)|
| 1:41:10| You know, I guess what my question is, though, is can, when there are serious violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6070)|
| 1:41:16| I mean, can we set fines or can we set penalties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6076)|
| 1:41:20| We're not handcuffed by any state laws on what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| That may be a question for the attorney in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6088)|
| 1:41:34| Well, Commissioners, it's an ongoing debate as to whether or not what kind of enforcement powers we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6094)|
| 1:41:38| what kind of penalties, whether or not they are, in fact, enforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| whether or not the individual can actually afford a penalty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6102)|
| 1:41:47| and whether or not your attitude towards these things is educational or punitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6107)|
| 1:41:52| But just to give you a black and answer as to how far you can go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| it would have to depend on your code and how it's crafted and what your ultimate goal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6116)|
| 1:42:04| So I guess the answer to that is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| I mean, if it was challenged as being unreasonable, then, you know, probably a judge would throw it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6127)|
| 1:42:13| That's the, I mean, I think that's really the essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6133)|
| 1:42:17| I'm not necessarily in favor of more rules, but I am in favor of more enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6137)|
| 1:42:23| When we do have things, when things go bad, it's just so the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| and the citizens of the county aren't stuck with a problem when it occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| And I'll go ahead and pass the rest of my time to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| I have just two or three questions, and we'll move on to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| Procedurally, Mr. Donaldson, can this plan be modified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6160)|
| 1:42:46| or does it have to be voted on up or down as is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| The proposed plan has been adopted by the Planning Commission as an amendment to the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6171)|
| 1:43:00| And as such, the legislative body, County Commission, is in that same position as you were with East County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6180)|
| 1:43:11| You would need an up and down vote on this to make it operative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6191)|
| 1:43:16| And then if you chose to make some amendments, you would initiate your own plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6196)|
| 1:43:24| just as you did with the East County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| So in the East County Sector Plan, what we've done is there's a task force that is looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| Now, East County Sector Plan, last month you initiated your own version of that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6213)|
| 1:43:40| by making a change to the property owned by the Development Corporation that has gone to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6220)|
| 1:43:47| well, it's going to the Planning Commission tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| And they will make a recommendation, then that will come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6231)|
| 1:43:57| The process for this would be comparable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6237)|
| 1:44:02| Since the plan has been adopted by the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| it needs an up or down vote from the legislative body to make it operative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| If you choose not to make it operative, you can then initiate your own version of the plan by tweaking it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6251)|
| 1:44:17| or gutting it or anything you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6257)|
| 1:44:21| So basically, from a procedural standpoint, we would not be able to come in and say a percentage on slope, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6261)|
| 1:44:28| and include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6268)|
| 1:44:29| We would have to vote down the plan and then have an amendment, which would go back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| I'm just trying to – okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| If the city adopts one version and the county adopts another version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6275)|
| 1:44:40| does the county live with its version and the city live with its version?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6280)|
| 1:44:44| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| The easiest way to explain it is since the city is a smaller body than the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6286)|
| 1:44:53| and again, going back to the East County Sector Plan might be a good parallel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| the city adopted the version that came from the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6297)|
| 1:45:03| So that will apply within their municipal boundaries, all of the policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6303)|
| 1:45:09| And the same would apply to this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6309)|
| 1:45:15| If one body adopts the Planning Commission version, that would apply within its geography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6315)|
| 1:45:22| If the other body adopts an amended version, the amended version would apply within its geography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6322)|
| 1:45:30| With regards to codes enforcement, do you know how many inspectors we have right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6330)|
| 1:45:34| I've heard the number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| Is that all we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| Is there someone from the administration here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6340)|
| 1:45:41| I can find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| It would be interesting to get the exact number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| and see how many people we actually have in that department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| because I like the idea that's been brought forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| and that is that we should take a look at our ordinances and strengthen what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| and make sure that what we have on the books is being followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6357)|
| 1:46:00| It is more than two, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| It is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| It's more than two, I know, because I know three of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| I'm not sure what the total is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| Commissioner Smith says maybe five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| We'll find out the exact number on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| Mr. Chairman, I know that in discussion on stormwater ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| that the proposed mayor's budget has cut the stormwater department from ten down to eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6376)|
| 1:46:26| With regards to the notification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| how much, again, would the notification be, as the plan is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6389)|
| 1:46:33| to notify the property owners of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6393)|
| 1:46:37| I have seen some figures, but I'm just wondering what the figure would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6397)|
| 1:46:43| Well, if we were to, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| send a postcard to every parcel owner whose property includes some part of the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6406)|
| 1:46:58| hillside and ridgetop protection area, our estimate is about $17,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6418)|
| 1:47:07| That placed in context, in this annual budget for MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6427)|
| 1:47:13| we have $19,000 devoted to public notice, the line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6433)|
| 1:47:20| So literally doubling our public notice budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6440)|
| 1:47:26| The thing to keep in mind is the term affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6446)|
| 1:47:32| I live in the proposed hillside ridgetop area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6452)|
| 1:47:39| My lot complies with the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| I have no opportunity to subdivide it or redevelop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6463)|
| 1:47:50| So I am in the area but not affected, and there are a lot of people like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6470)|
| 1:47:56| We're estimating that 70% of all of the parcels within the proposed area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6476)|
| 1:48:01| are developed lots that are smaller than two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6481)|
| 1:48:09| So they may not be affected by the plan at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6489)|
| 1:48:12| So it really becomes a question of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| is that a good way to spend $17,000 to send out notice to people who are not affected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6494)|
| 1:48:23| That's all the questions that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| I have read the document, have talked with a number of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6504)|
| 1:48:28| probably a number of you in the audience have contacted me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| and we've had some good conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| There seems to be some misinformation about when this is scheduled to be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6512)|
| 1:48:38| I've had people ask me, are we going to vote on it the 25th at 1.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| The answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| It is the first item on our agenda and our zoning at 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6523)|
| 1:48:47| And so we're not even in session at 1.30, so I'm not sure how that got out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| But it will not be voted on at 1.30 on the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| It is on the agenda for the 25th, and that is the first item at our zoning at 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6533)|
| 1:49:00| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6542)|
| 1:49:03| I'm going to keep my comments short and brief because I, like a lot of the people out in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6543)|
| 1:49:08| I'm 100% commissioned, so what I sell today is what I eat next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6548)|
| 1:49:13| So I want to get you all back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6553)|
| 1:49:17| Questions on the slides that you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| Can you go back to the slide, if you will, talking about the no changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6559)|
| 1:49:25| It was really early in your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6565)|
| 1:49:31| I think the one before that, I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6573)|
| 1:49:34| Go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| No new zoning district procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6581)|
| 1:49:47| And then you had another slide that went from 2.2 to 2.23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| I think it was a couple of slides after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| What was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6598)|
| 1:49:59| Explain that real quick again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6599)|
| 1:50:04| The current slope analysis procedures that we use, that we've used since 2003 for the sample site that I showed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6604)|
| 1:50:11| would generate a staff recommendation or be a staff recommendation based on 2.22 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6611)|
| 1:50:17| That would be the recommendation that was sent to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6617)|
| 1:50:20| With the new procedure, the recommendation that was sent to MPC would be for 442 units, 20 units more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6620)|
| 1:50:27| and a density of 2.32 dwelling units per acre because of the change in limiting the slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6627)|
| 1:50:33| only to the significant portions of the site, not the less significantly sloped portions of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6633)|
| 1:50:39| Currently, we do it for the entire parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6641)|
| 1:50:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| For people in the audience, you may not like this statement I'm fixing to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| but I've got a minor in forestry from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6647)|
| 1:50:51| And, yes, I love trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| It's one of the best classes and things that I took at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6653)|
| 1:50:56| I really enjoy my time in working with the Forestry Department at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| I can look at just about any bark of a tree and tell you what it is, look at any leaf of a tree and tell you what kind of tree it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6659)|
| 1:51:05| So I have a strong appreciation for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| One of the things that I'm a little upset about, or not upset, but I wish we could have done different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6670)|
| 1:51:17| the people that were at the table and developers, you all up and pretty much left the table from what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6677)|
| 1:51:24| Yes, I appointed people to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6684)|
| 1:51:26| We all asked for names, and I put some people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| and I was disheartened that some of the people got up and left the table over all the years and stuff that this process went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6689)|
| 1:51:37| Guys, when you did that, you took away your voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6697)|
| 1:51:40| And here you are today, and in great numbers, if you had to leave the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6700)|
| 1:51:45| I wish you could have replaced yourself with somebody else to take your seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| because otherwise it sort of keeps going down, you know, whatever path that per se you didn't want it to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6709)|
| 1:51:56| But when you up and leave the table like that, I wish that you had replaced yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6716)|
| 1:52:01| because quite a few of you all had done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6721)|
| 1:52:05| A comment I want to make, too, is during this two-, three-year procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6725)|
| 1:52:11| I thought it was a little bit disingenuous when we looked at pictures, and we saw pictures of developments and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6731)|
| 1:52:16| and it showed a person's project, and it wasn't finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| That's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| When you come up and you're showing, if I'm a developer and you're coming up there taking pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6743)|
| 1:52:28| and the grass hadn't grown yet or I haven't planted the trees, I haven't finished my project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6748)|
| 1:52:33| and you're saying how this is a bad project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| Well, yeah, it's a bad project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6755)|
| 1:52:36| I haven't finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| Leave me alone until I finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| Then come in and say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6758)|
| 1:52:46| We talk about developers say restrictions and others say it's a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6766)|
| 1:52:55| You know, it's pretty much the same thing, what you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6775)|
| 1:53:01| I do want to make a comment to the developers that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6781)|
| 1:53:05| Here's the way I look at it with you men and women that do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| I appreciate what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| I enjoy looking at development projects that are out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6791)|
| 1:53:15| because I see that you're looking that when you build to a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6795)|
| 1:53:19| you want to upgrade and try to build a better home or whatever subdivision to the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6799)|
| 1:53:25| Because you want to entice the people to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| And I know for a fact that you really want to try to save as many trees as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6808)|
| 1:53:34| Your trees are your assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| So, yes, and you know you can replant trees and whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| but to me, if I'm a developer, I'm going to try to keep every darn tree I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6821)|
| 1:53:44| I've never developed, but I think that I see that in you as developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6824)|
| 1:53:51| I appreciate, developers, what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6831)|
| 1:53:54| And as Tony mentioned, there are a few rascals in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| But, you know, I think that's our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6837)|
| 1:54:02| I think we need to police ourselves better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| If we need to hire more people to do enforcement, we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| But here's where I'm at with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6848)|
| 1:54:10| It's a property rights issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| I'm not Commissioner Owens over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| It's property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6854)|
| 1:54:20| A lot of people have been talking stuff back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| I'm just, you know, I'm not going to beat around the bush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6862)|
| 1:54:25| I'm going to vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6865)|
| 1:54:26| I'm going to vote against the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6866)|
| 1:54:30| But I'm going to vote yes for enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6870)|
| 1:54:33| We need to get more enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| But, you know, we spent a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| We spent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6877)|
| 1:54:38| And, Tony, appreciate what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6878)|
| 1:54:39| We've all done a lot of work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| But then when other people got off and left the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6881)|
| 1:54:45| I don't think we'd have been here as long as if we'd had more people stay at the table with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6885)|
| 1:54:51| But that's where I stand with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| And I'm not going to beat around the bush about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6893)|
| 1:54:56| By the way, I was just told that we have six building inspectors, four zoning inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| So we have that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6900)|
| 1:55:01| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6901)|
| 1:55:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| Not only does that number become important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6904)|
| 1:55:09| the posture that the current administration is going to take toward the work that we're doing right now will be important also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6909)|
| 1:55:18| Dean Rice was standing in the back of the audience earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| and I would have asked him that question at this particular point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6922)|
| 1:55:26| But that's something that needs to be before us as we attempt to develop and implement some of these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6926)|
| 1:55:34| I have about six or seven pages of notes of different speakers and different questions, things that have come to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6934)|
| 1:55:43| I appreciate especially all the comment made by the commissioners that are here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6943)|
| 1:55:50| One of the things that affects me, and it personally affects me, is where I grew up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6950)|
| 1:55:57| I still live across the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6957)|
| 1:56:01| And it's the largest part of Knox County is what we're talking about because every plan, every road, every development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6961)|
| 1:56:11| the largest possibility of these things affecting people in Knox County will affect people that live in the district that I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6971)|
| 1:56:19| You talk of 100-acre sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6979)|
| 1:56:23| You take a 100-acre site and divide it up into 50 acres and 25 acres and 25 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| Or you go to the other end of the plan and you talk about, well, if it's more than three acres or less than three acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6988)|
| 1:56:36| or more than five acres or less than five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| Well, as the first gentleman said from the podium, that's not talking about much property inside the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=6998)|
| 1:56:50| For example, even as Commissioner Smith would speak, I represent the two voting precincts that are north of Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7010)|
| 1:57:04| The voting precinct that was added to the eighth district, Gap Creek, you'll get them back, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7024)|
| 1:57:16| Those are the areas affected as far as I'm concerned because, well, it affects me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7036)|
| 1:57:26| Let me hit a couple of three notes that I wrote down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| One of the things that I kind of dislike is talking about the Midway Road area in connection with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7049)|
| 1:57:45| This implementation of the procedure we're looking at today has been around for three years, at least to my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7065)|
| 1:57:54| because I have been seated here for basically that length of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7074)|
| 1:57:59| I know we've talked about red places, you know, egregious cuts into hillsides, runoff, the water tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7079)|
| 1:58:14| We've talked about lots of things, but then it gets back to the very first comment that I made a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7094)|
| 1:58:19| What's the current administration going to do to assist us with those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| I believe Dr. Briggs made the same comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| If we need enforcement of what we've got, then that's what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7106)|
| 1:58:34| Somewhere into this rolls in technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| We've done it by art, and I'm pointing at the art that's on the wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7117)|
| 1:58:43| and now we're talking about something that can be done every foot or two or every six inches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7123)|
| 1:58:49| or whatever the possibility might be with technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7129)|
| 1:58:55| I'm a little bit hesitant to roll technology into some plan that has been maybe talked about for three years using art then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7135)|
| 1:59:12| I want people to know that I have been extremely on the fence on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7152)|
| 1:59:17| because it affects so many people that I have to represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7157)|
| 1:59:21| Now then, let's hit another couple of things that I think are sort of non-sequiturs when we talk about Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7161)|
| 1:59:29| I've been to Pittsburgh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| I believe it's up a river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| It's got hills around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7173)|
| 1:59:38| They had some kind of heavy industry there that may no longer be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| So how does that impact their 30% green space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| Or do they have 40% brownfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| I don't know, but I do have to look and think about how Pittsburgh exists now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7188)|
| 1:59:57| as opposed to maybe in the 40s and 50s and before that in the 20s and 30s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7197)|
| 2:00:03| And how does that compare to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7203)|
| 2:00:08| I thought the biggest comparison would be Detroit, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| How much of Detroit no longer exists because of some change there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7211)|
| 2:00:16| And I don't know whether we've had that change or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7216)|
| 2:00:19| Something may be in the paper today or yesterday about the comeback cities in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7219)|
| 2:00:26| and Knoxville is not a comeback city because we don't have anything to come back from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7226)|
| 2:00:33| employment or unemployment, whichever way you want to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7233)|
| 2:00:37| Things have been pretty good in Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7237)|
| 2:00:40| because of the close proximity of, well, Oak Ridge or the University of Tennessee or TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7240)|
| 2:00:49| or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| So we've got a lot of things to look at, and this is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7251)|
| 2:00:56| It's just that, you know, on the one hand, I don't think we're as bad off as some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7256)|
| 2:01:01| And whenever I say that, some people think our economy could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7261)|
| 2:01:06| Really, it was the economy that, in my opinion maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7266)|
| 2:01:10| when Commissioner Smith said we had pictures of things that were bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7270)|
| 2:01:17| maybe they were bad because of the economy, the downturn in the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7277)|
| 2:01:21| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7281)|
| 2:01:22| I'm just saying that a lot of calls I got last year or the year before last were due to water not being retained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7282)|
| 2:01:33| the developer no longer being at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7293)|
| 2:01:40| As I compared, I did want to pick up on one more comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7300)|
| 2:01:44| I've participated in half marathons in Asheville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7304)|
| 2:01:49| Asheville is a hilly place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| It's a beautiful place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| But I'd also say that I didn't run, I didn't jog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7314)|
| 2:01:59| I need to use the correct word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7319)|
| 2:02:01| I didn't jog by many 30-acre level sites that were what we would like to see here in Knox County on Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7321)|
| 2:02:11| or out at John Sevier or name any place in Knox County where we need something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7331)|
| 2:02:19| Asheville was not a good comparison either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| So I'm not throwing all the comparisons out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7341)|
| 2:02:24| I just want us to talk about Knox County and let's do what's right for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7344)|
| 2:02:36| I think I hit one or two things that are important to me that I see happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| We need to bring this technology into the way we control things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7359)|
| 2:02:46| And we need to watch where our water runs off to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7366)|
| 2:02:50| We need to know what the rules are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7370)|
| 2:02:55| In fact, knowing what the rules are gets me to one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7375)|
| 2:02:59| I believe I've had it, but I can't really grasp it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7379)|
| 2:03:05| It's not a rhetorical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7385)|
| 2:03:06| This is a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| If this is policy and we implement the policy, it does not affect current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7388)|
| 2:03:18| If someone is up for coming from ag into some other zone, would this policy affect that rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7398)|
| 2:03:29| If a property owner requested a change of zoning from ag to residential, a residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7409)|
| 2:03:39| and they were within the proposed hillside protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7419)|
| 2:03:46| staff would make a recommendation of the use of a planned zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7426)|
| 2:03:51| and we would use the plan to make a recommendation on the proposed density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7431)|
| 2:03:58| Within a planned residential zone, a cap on the number of dwelling units is established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7438)|
| 2:04:04| by having a density per acre times the number of acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7444)|
| 2:04:08| So the plan would be used to guide staff in making those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7448)|
| 2:04:14| That recommendation from staff then goes to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7454)|
| 2:04:18| The planning commission then makes a recommendation to the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7458)|
| 2:04:24| and the county commission creates the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7464)|
| 2:04:30| Quite often those recommendations don't hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7470)|
| 2:04:33| Quite often those recommendations are altered as it goes through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7473)|
| 2:04:37| The ultimate approval by the county commission is different than the recommendation made by staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7477)|
| 2:04:44| at the start of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7484)|
| 2:04:46| Sometimes even the zone district as a planned district is not upheld by the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7486)|
| 2:04:53| Ultimately, it is the decision of the legislative body to change the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7493)|
| 2:04:59| Planning commission and the staff of the planning commission make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7499)|
| 2:05:04| So ordinance or regulation or whatever has not changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7504)|
| 2:05:09| but the recommendation for the new zoning policy would be implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7509)|
| 2:05:15| We would use a slightly different formula in making our staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7515)|
| 2:05:20| the change being on those parts of the property that are greater than 40% slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7520)|
| 2:05:31| I retain all the units that I haven't used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7535)|
| 2:05:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7539)|
| 2:05:41| You know, where to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7541)|
| 2:05:46| The risk of being repetitive, from what I'm hearing basically today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7546)|
| 2:05:52| is the fact that the number one solution to this problem is better enforcement, higher fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7552)|
| 2:06:04| higher bonds, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7564)|
| 2:06:06| And talking about being repetitive, most of these folks out here in the real estate business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7566)|
| 2:06:11| what's the three most important things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7571)|
| 2:06:16| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7576)|
| 2:06:17| So sometimes it helps us to be repetitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7577)|
| 2:06:24| I've got several questions that have come up here today that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7584)|
| 2:06:32| every time we sit down and talk about this, it takes, you know, a different direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7592)|
| 2:06:38| It's really confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7598)|
| 2:06:41| You know, under the current planned residential zoning right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7601)|
| 2:06:49| are we using the hillside or slope protection rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7609)|
| 2:06:57| If so, how are they different now than they're going to be after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7617)|
| 2:07:07| We have in currently adopted plans hillside protection policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7627)|
| 2:07:14| including a set of geography in our sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7634)|
| 2:07:19| We use those in conformity with the criteria that's on the left of your screen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7639)|
| 2:07:33| The change really is to broaden the hillside protection area to include ridgetops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7653)|
| 2:07:41| and more hillside that's scientifically determined rather than artistically determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7661)|
| 2:07:47| and to slightly modify the criteria that we use for those parts of properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7667)|
| 2:07:55| that are greater than 40% slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7675)|
| 2:07:59| So for a property that's currently in the hillside area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7679)|
| 2:08:07| and would go to the new hillside area, the only difference would be that portion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7687)|
| 2:08:14| greater than 40% would get less of a credit as far as the recommended density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7694)|
| 2:08:20| Well, how many, I'm sure it's not very many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7700)|
| 2:08:24| how many applications do you get in a year for development above 40%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7704)|
| 2:08:35| Not many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7715)|
| 2:08:36| Some properties have a little of everything, but literally there is not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7716)|
| 2:08:41| I don't recall area-wide how much of the area is greater than 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7721)|
| 2:08:47| And from what I'm hearing today and other times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7727)|
| 2:08:54| and let's just nail this down once and for all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7734)|
| 2:08:58| that there basically is no change on properties from zero or 15% to 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7738)|
| 2:09:05| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| If you were currently in the slope protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7747)|
| 2:09:11| there would be no change on that portion of your property below 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7751)|
| 2:09:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| The proposed protection area is larger than our current area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7757)|
| 2:09:21| so there would be more properties subject to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7761)|
| 2:09:24| Well, it stands to reason whether if it's in the current area or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7764)|
| 2:09:31| it rains on both of those areas at the same rate usually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7771)|
| 2:09:37| If you're going to develop either one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7777)|
| 2:09:41| they should be held to the same rules and regulations as far as stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7781)|
| 2:09:48| We have constantly stormwater issues coming before this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7788)|
| 2:09:55| and I know Commissioner Norman has worked on that stormwater committee for how many years now, Tony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7795)|
| 2:10:01| But it's a very serious issue in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7801)|
| 2:10:06| As we found out, as Commissioner Ormby mentioned, February 28th, that particular week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7806)|
| 2:10:11| we had areas flooded all over town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| A lot of that could have been prevented had we taken the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7815)|
| 2:10:21| and not taken the shortcuts back there whenever to take care of where it's going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7821)|
| 2:10:29| Now, I know some of those were done because, well, this will handle what we've got right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7829)|
| 2:10:37| because nobody's ever going to build up there, so it's not going to matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7837)|
| 2:10:41| We've gotten to the point now where what's up there behind that is becoming a valuable option in a lot of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7841)|
| 2:10:51| So that necessitates some stronger regulations, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7851)|
| 2:10:58| because the steeper it is, the faster it's going to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7858)|
| 2:11:05| If you have not, if anybody who has not been out to the Wildwood subdivision on John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7865)|
| 2:11:11| about a mile and a half west of Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7871)|
| 2:11:14| wind your way back to the back of that subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7874)|
| 2:11:18| and look at the mountaintop that was desecrated, pulled down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7878)|
| 2:11:23| and now is filling the streets with mud and a development that is broke, and we're left with a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7883)|
| 2:11:31| Just take a look at that and tell me we don't need some kind of regulation to protect those steeper slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110413?start=7891)|
