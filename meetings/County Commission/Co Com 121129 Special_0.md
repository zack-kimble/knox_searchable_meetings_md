| 0:00:00| Welcome to our workshop where we're continuing our discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=0)|
| 0:00:12| and look at our billboard ordinance and related issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=12)|
| 0:00:18| This afternoon, we've had a couple of people that have requested to speak as in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=18)|
| 0:00:24| We've already had two public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=24)|
| 0:00:27| And I think unless some of the other commissioners would like to call on some people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=27)|
| 0:00:35| I think my preference would be to focus on certainly Mr. Donaldson and Mr. Sanders, Mr. Pierce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=35)|
| 0:00:48| and in terms of their ability to give us information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=48)|
| 0:00:52| If somebody wants to call on some folks, the thing that happens sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=52)|
| 0:00:59| if we go on into public forum, which we don't want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=59)|
| 0:01:03| I don't think any of us want again is just to repeat things that we've said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=63)|
| 0:01:10| which is not necessarily so are going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=70)|
| 0:01:14| So I'll let that we'll keep it at that format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=74)|
| 0:01:21| And then if I'll let some of my fellow commissioners call on people, if they'd like to, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=81)|
| 0:01:29| Let me have signed up, Tony, just two, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=89)|
| 0:01:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| Right now, we have Jim Dorop and Jim Duesen just two people to speak, that's all, that have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=92)|
| 0:01:43| So, you know, I think ideally what we want from this is the best discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=103)|
| 0:01:49| the most information we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| And so let's just see how it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=113)|
| 0:01:58| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| Let's get our primary speakers out there first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=119)|
| 0:02:03| And then if we'll see how long that takes and how many questions we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=123)|
| 0:02:12| Yes, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| Is Dr. Briggs, I mean, do we know if we talk to him, do we know if he's going to be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| I have not heard anything from Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| Shelly, have you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| I just, the reason I have, I mean, I'd really like to work toward a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=141)|
| 0:02:27| or a resolution of getting some restrictions on some of the EMCs and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=147)|
| 0:02:35| for us to be more aggressive than Asheville, North Carolina, seems to me to be unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| And so I would like to work toward finding a solution of doing some things that are appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=161)|
| 0:02:49| while protecting the right for people to run a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| And so, and I don't know where to start that process if, you know, if Dr. Briggs is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| This is his ordinance that he's brought forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| And so, I guess, where do we start the process of bringing forth some of that compromise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=183)|
| 0:03:10| And that's where what we're trying, the purpose of the workshop is to see also if the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=190)|
| 0:03:20| I'm trying to get a flavor of what the commission wants to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| and if we have some directions that appear to be in the majority in terms of what we want to do about something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=204)|
| 0:03:33| in the regulatory aspect rather than the bands as written as we have in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| So that's what I want to investigate and ask questions of Mr. Donaldson about and Mr. Pierce and Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=219)|
| 0:03:50| So that's kind of my objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| What are the possibilities here with outside of just the resolutions as they exist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=235)|
| 0:04:02| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| I'm ready to start the asking questions if we're at that phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| I have a number of questions I want to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| Why don't we go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| You lead off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| I'd like to, first of all, nail down the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| The first fact I'd like to know, how many billboards are outside of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=259)|
| 0:04:27| I mean outside of the city that are in Knox County, outside of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| How many billboards are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| There have been all kinds of numbers flying around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| I'd like to get a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| Mr. Pierce, do you have some numbers for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| Yes, sir, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| There was 188 advertising sign structures with a total of 402 billboard faces in the county alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=283)|
| 0:04:52| excluding Farragut and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| You know, when we say advertising, are we talking about billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| Are we talking about electronic signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| Is that what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| That's billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| Just billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| Off-premise advertising, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| That's 188 structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| So some of those are two-sided and some are changeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=308)|
| 0:05:14| You're talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| Some have three faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| Some have four faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| But 188 structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=320)|
| 0:05:27| Secondly, with regards to the lawsuits, what lawsuits have been filed against the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=327)|
| 0:05:40| There are two lawsuits that were filed against the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| They have been consolidated into one lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| I pulled a rule docket from Chancellor Fantzler's court today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=350)|
| 0:05:57| and there have not been any documents filed in either case since 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=357)|
| 0:06:07| And from my communications with the city law director's office, those cases are in discovery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=367)|
| 0:06:14| which means parties are exchanging information, documents, stipulating to facts, preparing motions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=374)|
| 0:06:24| getting ready to wind the case up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| But this is a long case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| I have copies of the filings that have been filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=391)|
| 0:06:42| There's a complaint, a petition for certiorari, and some summonses and an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=402)|
| 0:06:59| And that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| What is the nature of the lawsuit that the billboard company has filed against the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| What exactly is the lawsuit over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| Well, they've made several complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| One is a First Amendment violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| One is a declaratory judgment action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=435)|
| 0:07:23| And they're complaining about, you know, due process, equal protection, and First Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=443)|
| 0:07:34| You know, those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| Is it over billboards or is it over the digital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| It's over billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| So how does the digital component go in and figure into that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| I guess I'm trying to figure out here is they filed a lawsuit over billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| Does that mean that they're filing a lawsuit over the fact there can be no more billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| And they're wanting more billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| Is that what they're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| Is there a digital component of this that they're saying that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| Right now in the city of Knoxville you can't get a permit for a new billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| And they filed a lawsuit challenging that ordinance that they passed back in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| And they're in litigation over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| And that's the reason that we had the moratorium for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| We're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| We didn't want to go into that same night, as it were, without knowing the outcome of that litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=507)|
| 0:08:36| So it's been going on three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| You said 2009?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| That was the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| That's when the last paper was filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| Well, the last substantive document was filed in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| The cases were consolidated recently in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| So, I mean, it's just moving really slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| Mr. Donaldson, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| And I know that there are documents here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| What exactly are we being asked to consider with regards to billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| And I would like to know about billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| I know there are three ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| Give me the cliff note version of exactly what is being asked of us to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| You have three ordinances in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| Number one, we were asked to the planning commission was asked to make a recommendation regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| prohibiting billboards throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| The county already prohibits billboards in a number of zone districts, by far the majority of zone districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=575)|
| 0:09:43| and allows them in a handful of commercial and planned commercial districts and the industrial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=583)|
| 0:09:51| Can I ask you questions as we go through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| Because, you know, I don't want to interrupt, but I want to make sure that I've got everything done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| When you say prohibit billboards, are we talking about taking billboards that are existing down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| or is this a prohibition on new billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| It would be a prohibition on new billboards, new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| So we recommended language comparable to what is in the city's ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=612)|
| 0:10:18| where they currently prohibit new billboards in all of their zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| And part of that was creating a process for registering existing billboards to establish their legal nonconforming status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=623)|
| 0:10:35| So we've put that language in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| Ordinance number one adds a line to the zone districts that now allow billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| so that they will then prohibit billboards in those zone districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| and add some general language about creating a period of time for owners of billboards to register| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=649)|
| 0:10:57| to establish their legal status so that they can continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| The second ordinance involves electronic message centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| which are on-premise signs that use digital means to change messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=669)|
| 0:11:18| And the direction from the commission to the county commission to the planning commission was to make a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=678)|
| 0:11:27| regarding the regulation of EMC, electronic message centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| so that it's comparable to what the city has in place now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=692)|
| 0:11:39| thinking that as motorists drive many of our thoroughfares, they're moving in and out of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| and why would we have different regulations lot by lot going back and forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| So we put two recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| We, staff, put two recommendations in front of the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| One, to prohibit new EMC and to, at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=720)|
| 0:12:10| create operating standards that would apply to all of the existing EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| So existing EMC would be grandfathered in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| but they would have new regulations that manage their operating characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=739)|
| 0:12:26| And then we presented another version which simply created regulations for new and existing EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=746)|
| 0:12:36| The planning commission recommended that you adopt simply the regulation part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=756)|
| 0:12:44| not the prohibition part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| But you have that language in front of you if you want to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| The third one was specifically about the conversion of existing billboards to a digital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=770)|
| 0:12:59| or electronic billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| So our recommendation in that case was to create a definition for the electronic billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=781)|
| 0:13:09| Currently, there is none in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| And to add language to the building off of the prohibition language to add another paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=792)|
| 0:13:20| that said that conversions of billboard, existing billboards that are grandfathered in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=800)|
| 0:13:28| were prohibited to be converted to digital boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| So the three are prohibiting billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| Second is regulating or prohibiting electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| And then the third one is about prohibiting the conversion of existing billboards to digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| But on the billboards, this would be any new billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| Billboards that are there now could stay, but they would have to, you say, be registered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| And then the second one would be the electronic message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| Anybody who has one now could keep it, but they would be regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| They couldn't build new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| The recommendation was if you want to go down the path of prohibiting new EMC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| you should also create operating standards for the existing EMC and allow them to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| but operate differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| And that deals with the static hold time on the message, the instant switch of one message to another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=859)|
| 0:14:29| rather than scrolling and bursting and a lot of the flashing lights that you get now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=869)|
| 0:14:36| Some characteristics about the letter size to make them readable and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| So purely operating standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| What about the one here on Visit Knoxville down here on the corner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| That was very controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| There is a provision in the city's ordinance that new EMCs are prohibited except in areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=891)|
| 0:15:02| that have either the historic overlay or the downtown design overlay district on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=902)|
| 0:15:10| in which case they are allowed, but they are subject to guidelines and approval by another body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=910)|
| 0:15:18| So in the case of the historic overlay district, they have to be approved by the historic zoning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=918)|
| 0:15:25| And in the case of the D1, the downtown design overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| they have to be approved by the downtown design review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| So if you have an electronic message center, you're at a business, and you're flashing time and temperature, that would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=934)|
| 0:15:41| But any new person would need to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| Well, according to the ordinance, that would not be prohibited at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| So there would be a ban on any future EMCs if someone wanted to put in a flashing light of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| temperature, or a gas price or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| There are two exceptions, one for time and temperature and one for changeable price signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| the signs that you see commonly at gas stations and motels and hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=964)|
| 0:16:11| There is a provision that in the city's ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| and we've built that into the recommended language for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| that changeable price signs are allowed even though the new EMCs are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=980)|
| 0:16:28| So a changeable price sign is defined as the use of the electronic message only for the purpose of advertising a price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=988)|
| 0:16:39| What about a lottery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Let's say you wanted to say the lottery has gone from 400 to 450 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1000)|
| 0:16:47| In other words, what I'm getting at here is that we're saying no, but yet there are exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| There are exceptions in the city's ordinance, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| Now, with the digital boards, those that are there now, they would be grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1015)|
| 0:17:05| Is that what I'm hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| Or how would those work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| If they're already existing digital boards now, they would so that you're talking about any new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| the ordinance would say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| Are you familiar with, and I don't know the nuances of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| I've just heard about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| It's called a cap and replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| Are you familiar with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| I believe Asheville, North Carolina has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| Mr. Andrews mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| I'm familiar with many communities that have established a limit on the number of billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1050)|
| 0:17:37| that they will allow, and then they allow conversions or new boards in exchange for old boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1057)|
| 0:17:48| And many communities have an exchange rate that's been built into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| where you trade a number of billboard faces for one new billboard face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| How has that worked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Well, the list of communities that are doing it keeps growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| I first came across it in a couple of suburbs of Minneapolis and St. Paul,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| and the first one that went in kind of a unique case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| They had only one billboard operator in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| and they got them to take down all of their existing billboards in exchange for six new digital boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1102)|
| 0:18:30| and it was like a three-to-one rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| And then many other suburbs in the Twin Cities followed that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| There are examples in Texas and Florida, Gulfport, Mississippi, where they're doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1119)|
| 0:18:47| and they've established exchange rates of anywhere from three to 15 faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1127)|
| 0:18:57| You said other communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| The communities, the number of communities doing this are growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| That would signal to me that the fact that they're growing means that it seems to be working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| that there seems to be a compromise that's been worked out on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| and that the industry and the government seem to have worked together on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| Am I reading that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| I know I followed the one in Minnetonka, Minnesota, very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| I happened to be acquainted with the city manager there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| and that quite literally was negotiated over a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| And the end result was they rewrote their sign ordinance with regard to billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1169)|
| 0:19:36| and established that the company would take down everything that they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| and put up these new ones in specified places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1181)|
| 0:19:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| I appreciate the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| And, of course, Dr. Briggs, as we were waiting on you to arrive and we're glad you're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| you just missed a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| We did talk a little bit about Bill gave us how many structures we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| and mentioned lawsuits in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| And then, of course, Mr. Donaldson just went through the three resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| and described those to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| And then, of course, Mike had several questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| So that's where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| Mr. Brown, do you have you want some questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| You got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| Any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| At the moment, Mr. Donaldson, I had you want to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| And I really do apologize for being late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| You know, there's been a lot of communities we've heard this talked about that have banned new billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| They've banned the digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| Do we have any idea about the communities that have done this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| and after they've stopped putting in new billboards, they've stopped converting to digital billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| Do they think this is a bad idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| And, you know, they've changed and gone back and said, you know, we liked it better when we had more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1257)|
| 0:21:05| or we liked it better with the digitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| You know, has there been any sort of buyer's regret after they've done that that you're aware of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1267)|
| 0:21:15| I am not familiar with any that have expressed regret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| And as recently as last year, found a really good summary of the trends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1279)|
| 0:21:27| and it is a seems to be a growing number of communities and counties that are going down the path of exchanges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1287)|
| 0:21:36| and swaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1296)|
| 0:21:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| Mr. Donaldson, I had a couple of questions as sort of in response to some of your information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1307)|
| 0:21:55| When you said, as regards recommendations from the Planning Commission about those resolutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1315)|
| 0:22:05| the EMCs particularly, does the Planning Commission staff have recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1325)|
| 0:22:15| or when you look at these resolutions, does the staff have a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| We make a recommendation to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| and then they act to make a recommendation to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| So for each one of those resolutions that we had and those aspects of those resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| which you just discussed, what were the staff, some of the staff information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1355)|
| 0:22:43| In all three cases, the Planning Commission followed staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1363)|
| 0:22:51| In the case of EMC, we also presented to them an alternative language to prohibit new EMCs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1371)|
| 0:23:00| and regulate the existing operating characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| They made the recommendation simply to regulate EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| So they didn't agree with the prohibition on the EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| So that was the only place that they really varied from staff recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| in terms of our resolutions that were in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| I guess I've got a couple of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| This may go around whoever, Daniel or Mr. Pierce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1407)|
| 0:23:34| One thing, I guess this is to Mr. Pierce first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| And I guess I'd preface my remarks with I don't think that anybody, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1420)|
| 0:23:51| I am very concerned with the appearance of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1431)|
| 0:23:58| And certainly I think it's a chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| this may be a chance for us to progress in terms of an aesthetic almost that we fail to have in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1444)|
| 0:24:14| So I don't, I think the scenic Knoxville people would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| they know how passionate I am about some of the environmental issues, land use issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| But I do view this as a place where we might get something for both sides, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1466)|
| 0:24:33| But in the process of doing that, certainly there's some big questions from the people that have to make it work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1473)|
| 0:24:42| like you guys, Mr. Pierce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| So just on the practical side, let's say we worked out something that was in the form of a swap, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1485)|
| 0:24:53| And we were able to get an agreement about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1493)|
| 0:25:00| a certain number of billboards that were removed from the terrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| And we get locations that we agree upon that the industry wants and needs and benefits from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1503)|
| 0:25:13| But on the practical side of you all trying to monitor that and regulate that and make it work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1513)|
| 0:25:21| has there been a discussion about what that, what's involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1521)|
| 0:25:27| What if the commission says, okay, digital can go forward, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| with a certain number of removals of the regular billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| But what does that mean to you all as you try to make it work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| It would just have to be, you know, thoroughly documented and closely monitored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| which would involve, of course, myself in the office mainly and the inspectors in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| Have you seen or are you all in the process of researching that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| Have you researched it in other areas to see what they do or how they've done it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1559)|
| 0:26:06| No, we have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Are you aware of budgetary problems that, I mean, this is staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| This is additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Is it, if we were to do this, to go this way, would there be additional staff required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1573)|
| 0:26:21| I don't believe there would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| There would be permit fees for the removal of structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| and permit fees for the installation of new structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| And those fees are designed to cover permitting and inspection costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| In terms of fees right now, and do you feel that the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1596)|
| 0:26:43| and what it requires of the industry in terms of their permit fees is fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| Is that equitable in terms of how you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| And you're able to control the billboard signage process in a way that meets our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1611)|
| 0:27:03| So is that fair and equitable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| I believe it is fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Fees have not been raised for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| I believe it, you know, closely covers our costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1629)|
| 0:27:15| In the case of digital, you know, we're relying on a lot of self-policing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| If they turn them on nights and weekends, flashing wildly, we have nobody out there looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| So if we're going to monitor them that closely, yeah, it would involve more staff, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| And then I guess this is to Mr. Donaldson now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| Mr. Donaldson, if we went forward, and, obviously, this is not on the agenda this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1654)|
| 0:27:44| This has been deferred to January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| I think it would probably be wise and I'll put it on as a discussion item for us this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| so it doesn't go completely cold and we can use some of the information we get from this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1673)|
| 0:28:01| If we were to seem like the sentiment of the body leaned towards a swap, what's our process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1681)|
| 0:28:12| I mean, can we go ahead with prohibitions, the prohibitive language in certain parts of these resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1692)|
| 0:28:21| and then work out the details?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| I mean, that's handed off to you all and then a few months down the road you're able to bring us back language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1707)|
| 0:28:35| which takes up all the concerns about illumination and lag time or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1715)|
| 0:28:43| all these various things that go with digital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| But tell us, describe some of the process, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| Well, certainly the concept of an exchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| starts with fixing a number of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| And the way to do that is one way to do that would be to prohibit new billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1742)|
| 0:29:09| and to prohibit the conversion of existing billboards to digital as the first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1749)|
| 0:29:19| and then come back with a program, a billboard reduction program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1759)|
| 0:29:27| which creates exceptions to that prohibition or perhaps the relocation of an existing billboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1767)|
| 0:29:36| from one spot to another spot in exchange for taking down a number of faces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| or do it on a square footage basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| or for the conversion of an existing billboard that's in a spot that you like from traditional to digital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1785)|
| 0:29:56| in exchange for the elimination of a number of billboard faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1796)|
| 0:30:03| So I think the whole exchange and swap concept starts with a cap and then works from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1803)|
| 0:30:13| And you can get so detailed as to designate where you may want to allow relocated billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1813)|
| 0:30:22| or converted billboards and be specific about where you might want to remove billboard faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1822)|
| 0:30:31| You know, from the comments at the public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1831)|
| 0:30:38| it's pretty clear that, you know, the industry wants to use the technology that's available to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| and they want to be able to follow growth as it occurs in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| So they want the flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| The other camp in the public meetings, you know, wanted to set no more new billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1853)|
| 0:31:01| and even said fewer billboards would be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| And this sort of a program could accomplish both through an exchange program that's crafted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1864)|
| 0:31:15| so that it provides some flexibility as far as relocating boards or converting boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1875)|
| 0:31:21| But in exchange for that flexibility, you get a reduction in the total number of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1881)|
| 0:31:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| As we're talking about the process and defining some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| defining parts of it that are troublesome certainly to the folks that are against the billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1899)|
| 0:31:50| I think content is kind of off the table, I mean, as far as I can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| The issues of illumination and sequencing and so on and so forth, those can be controlled, regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1916)|
| 0:32:06| I think the industry realizes how obnoxious they can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1926)|
| 0:32:15| And they're making adjustments currently to a lot of their digital boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1935)|
| 0:32:23| But that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| That can be defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| Are there, in the public forum, were there concerns of the anti-billboard group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1948)|
| 0:32:37| that really can't be addressed in a regulatory fashion that you heard or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1957)|
| 0:32:46| Well, there's the aesthetic aspect to that position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1966)|
| 0:32:54| which probably can be addressed only by reducing the number of boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1974)|
| 0:33:01| or cleaning up some of the old boards, both of which could be achieved by an exchange program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1981)|
| 0:33:12| And then there's the safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| You know, billboards are designed to attract attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| And digital unregulated certainly can go off the charts as far as what they're capable of doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=1997)|
| 0:33:26| But you can regulate the brightness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| You can regulate the static hold time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| You can regulate an instant message change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| You can regulate against scrolling and flashing and all of those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| We have done that with EMCs in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| And that's been in place for a couple of years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| And there is a significant difference with the EMCs that are operating under today's operating regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2028)|
| 0:33:57| compared to how they were operating two and three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2037)|
| 0:34:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2044)|
| 0:34:04| Before I acknowledge another light over here, Daniel, did you have any comments relative to anything that's been said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2044)|
| 0:34:14| between Mr. Pierce and Mr. Donaldson in this last part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| I don't think I have anything to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| I'm here to answer any of your specific questions about legal questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2061)|
| 0:34:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| So no legal flags jump up at this time for you in the discussion so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2069)|
| 0:34:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| I don't know who had their light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| Ms. Wright, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| It's just a question of numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| We have 188 structures, 402 faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| How many of the electronic billboards exist in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2090)|
| 0:34:58| We had a number of 11, I think, that have been permitted before the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2098)|
| 0:35:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| I'm intrigued by this swap scenario, but I frankly have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| I've talked to some people in the industry, relatively small guys, operators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| and that has not been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| And I've gotten all the correspondence I guess we all have from Greg Isaacs representing Lamar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2128)|
| 0:35:35| and e-mails and letters and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| And I haven't heard that mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| I'd like to hear more data on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2139)|
| 0:35:45| It seems to be that that would be, look, if I own 100 billboards, why am I going to take any of them down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| I mean, apparently I can't be made to take them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| I would have to be compensated greatly if I do what happens, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| an interstate comes through or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| They make me take it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| I still get a lot of compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| I'd have to be to make that swap, I'm thinking that would have to be made whole on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2165)|
| 0:36:12| If I get $100 a month from one I'm giving up, I would have to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| If it's ten to one, I'm going to have to get $1,000 back for a digital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| I'm just seeing the complications of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| And the economics of it don't appear to work to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| I will do some more research and ask them around in the next few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| I'm glad you're going to put it back on discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| Daniel, is the city lawsuit, is it the city of Knoxville versus Lamar at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2195)|
| 0:36:42| Or do you know who the other side is, the plaintiff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| Yes, the other way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| It's Lamar that sued the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| Okay, Lamar sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| Lamar, just Lamar, or do they have other parties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| I only see Lamar Advertising Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| And Mark, as far as the electronic message, you touched on the gas stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2224)|
| 0:37:12| Would that include the banks out there with CD rates and things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| Or even spinning, I believe, like down at the Tourist Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2237)|
| 0:37:25| Certainly, the scrolling is prohibited now in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| But changeable price signs are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| There's a cap on the square footage, a cap on the number per property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| And they are allowed to change that price only once per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2262)|
| 0:37:48| But certainly, a CD rate could be considered a price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| If a bank wanted to incorporate a changeable EMC into their overall sign package, I would think that could fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2272)|
| 0:38:01| That would be allowed in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| The two most common are, obviously, gas stations and motels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| The pilots, waggles, bread boxes, and so forth, they can --that's all right going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2289)|
| 0:38:16| They can still change their prices from inside once a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| Once a day, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| What's the logic behind having this, the allowance, I understand it in a CBID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| or that's not the term, but you said in the --what's the logic for historic zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| I mean, that to me is people with historic overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| Why are they allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| It was pretty much to acknowledge the fact that the marquee for the Tennessee Theater would not have met the new standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2321)|
| 0:38:51| that were adopted, and they wanted to create a path for something like that to be possible in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2331)|
| 0:38:59| And then the theory on the D1, the downtown design overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| is that downtown is a more dynamic place than the rest of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| And if you're going to have digital signs, perhaps that is the place where you would first allow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2350)|
| 0:39:18| And many, many communities are doing that sort of thing where they're designating very urban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2358)|
| 0:39:25| very active places and being more permissive in their regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| I think, you know, Gay Street gets that designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| And I personally like that sign at the tourist thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| It reminds me of the Times Square sign I've seen all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| You know, it's probably been there 50 years or 80 years or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| I mean, the scrolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| And one, I guess I'm just going to ask Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2386)|
| 0:39:53| This is a dumb question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| It's not a leading question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| I'm just --I'm sure it's not a leading question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| Is this an attempt to resolve this so we don't have to continue to bump the moratorium every six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2398)|
| 0:40:07| to finally bring a resolution to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| And is that your intent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| Well, you know, actually I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| I wasn't the one that brought it up because the moratorium kept rolling over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| I think it came from the NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| And then I wanted to make it in a slightly different form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| And that's why I brought up those resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| But, you know, I do agree that this has been going on now for about four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| or probably now getting closer to four and a half years because I believe it was in the spring of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| And I may be off on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| It's time to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| You know, we all have a bad habit at every level of government of kicking the can down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2438)|
| 0:40:45| and not addressing issues sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| But this was really, I believe, I think that's correct, Mark, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| I think it was brought up by the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| Someone else brought it up, and it was on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| And then I just modified the resolutions so we could address all those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| That's how it came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| Does anybody have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| I can comment, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| The first two ordinances date back to the fall of 2011 when county commission requested that MPC study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2467)|
| 0:41:18| and make recommendations on the prohibition of new billboards and the regulation of EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| So it was the county commission more than a year ago that initiated our study of it for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2484)|
| 0:41:31| We had previously done it for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| And then the third item, the conversion of traditional to digital boards, occurred just a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2494)|
| 0:41:42| But, again, that was at the request of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| We did not initiate these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| Did you ñ I know Mr. Sanders needed to comment about a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| I was going to address Commissioner Shouse's issue about the cap-and-trade, what's been called cap-and-trade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2519)|
| 0:42:07| or cap-and-replace, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| It's clear that you can regulate the parts of the billboard that do not communicate content of a message or a speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2531)|
| 0:42:20| And those are things such as the height of the billboard, the location of the billboard from the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| the setbacks, the zones where you can put a billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2545)|
| 0:42:32| I think the way that a billboard, a digital billboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| shows a message is more like a setback or an illumination requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| or a height requirement than regulation of the content of whatever the billboard says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2563)|
| 0:42:50| And that's why you can regulate a swap between a digital billboard and a traditional face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2570)|
| 0:42:58| by relocating a traditional ñ or converting a traditional billboard to an electronic billboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2578)|
| 0:43:05| or relocating a digital billboard to another site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| And if you impose a cap on the number of billboards so there aren't going to be any more billboards built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2590)|
| 0:43:18| no more permits, then you can replace or convert and require a reduction that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2598)|
| 0:43:28| And it's not going to be a taking under the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2608)|
| 0:43:36| I don't know if that ñ because the cap's in place, that's the reason you can require the swap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2616)|
| 0:43:46| I'm trying to apply the laws of economics to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| I probably can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| If I had a ñ if there are 400 in Knoxville and suddenly become 200,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| it looks like the remaining 200 are much more valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| Maybe it's probably not that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| They would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| But the way you get to the 200, if that's your number, you would say, well, you have 400 and they're static.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2640)|
| 0:44:10| You can't move them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| You can't convert them unless you give up a number of billboards to either move one or convert it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2651)|
| 0:44:23| And it's an incentive, I guess, because billboard companies have expressed a desire, like Mr. Donaldson said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2663)|
| 0:44:35| to move them to where the traffic is and to convert them to the newer technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| so that they can display more content with less, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2681)|
| 0:44:47| effort to get up there and actually change the paint on the billboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| or change the wrap or whatever it is on the billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| They have an incentive to want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| If they can't convert or can't move, can't get any new permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| they have to negotiate the number of the swap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| Like Mr. Donaldson said, other places are doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| And it doesn't appear to violate any of the constitutional principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2713)|
| 0:45:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| Maybe we can hear from that industry sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| If the people who have enough economies have enough numbers to make that realistic to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2725)|
| 0:45:32| It would only be Lamar, wouldn't it, I would think, in this community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| I've read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| I've got something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| It's from the City of Los Angeles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| The City of Los Angeles has thousands and thousands of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| And Lamar worked with the city and proposed and supported a plan there that would have reduced the number of billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2745)|
| 0:45:55| in that city by 44 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| Or that number at that time was reduced by 3,500 billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2759)|
| 0:46:06| That's an enormous number of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| But Lamar was willing to do that in Los Angeles in order to convert some of the billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2768)|
| 0:46:15| the traditional faces to digital faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| Did you have something else, Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| Yeah, I was going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| You know, Ed was sort of asking, you know, what was I thinking when we did this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| What's the purpose behind all of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| And I just want to share some thoughts about why I brought this up in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| It's something I think that we need to have now because once the conversion has been made on the billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| the horse is pretty much out of the barn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| And, you know, there's a lot of those things I don't like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| but there's a time and a place for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| And I'm not offended to go down there at the Tennessee Theater and see flashing lights, you know, that's down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2813)|
| 0:47:00| You know, on Gay Street, that sort of is a time and a place for the electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| It's sort of a place for, you know, maybe to consider those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| Those are in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| But when we're talking about the city of Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| we're really talking about two different things because what's in the city of Knoxville, to a large degree, is urban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2835)|
| 0:47:24| And some of those things, you know, I don't like anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| But it is an urban environment, and it's not as obnoxious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| It's not as, you know, it's just not something that interferes as much with what you're looking at as it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2853)|
| 0:47:44| It's if you're doing that stretch of road once you leave Knoxville, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| particularly as you're heading towards Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| Because I do agree with, you know, with Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| East Knox County and that 8th District out there where he lives is really a very beautiful place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| And a lot of the billboards as you're heading out of town really are just advertising things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| because there's no hotels out there at the midway exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| There's no hotels as you're going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| It's really just advertising things up in Sevierville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| And, really, the whole purpose of, you know, when we first started this back four years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2890)|
| 0:48:18| was to try to put a stop now, before the horse is out of the barn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2898)|
| 0:48:24| about putting these bright billboards out in the rural areas and on some of the scenic highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| I think they're not supposed to put some of those on some of the highways like Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| and maybe the parts of the Pellissippi, the John Sevier Highway, and others on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| And, you know, I would really like to ban all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| But even along any type of signs along those places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| There is one electronic sign right out there on the Pellissippi right before you cross the Clinch River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| And I just think it's a shame that that's there because that's a very beautiful area out there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| But even along the interstate, as you leave Knoxville, that stretch as you're heading up toward the Sevier County line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2936)|
| 0:49:03| I think it would really be nice if we didn't have any billboards out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| I think it's really nice not to have any billboards along some of those stretches of Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| and John Sevier Highway and on the Pellissippi between, I guess they call it officially I-140,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| between 40 and Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| And even if we start doing exchanges and they take three billboards down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| and they're right out there in the middle of this nice green area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| now we have these things flashing at you at night, making it look like Las Vegas or somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2967)|
| 0:49:35| That's just not the time and the place for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| And, you know, really the whole purpose before we had discussions with anyone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| and there was a lot of input on this is just to put a stop to it now before it gets out of hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| And I wouldn't want to take down three billboards as you're leaving the interstate to go towards Sevier County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2990)|
| 0:49:56| and put up, you know, one digital billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| I think that's a bigger distraction to the scenery and even to the people around there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| than having the billboards that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| And we have one opportunity to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| And what we do right we'll be living with for probably the next 30 or 40 or 50 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| and what we do wrong we're going to be living with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| And we just have an opportunity now to do something right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| and try to protect the areas that I think the citizens have been overwhelming in saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3025)|
| 0:50:32| that they really don't want those things there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| You know, we always say we represent the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| And sometimes we have to do what's right for the community even if it's contrary to what public opinion would make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| But I think the public opinion for people that live here is that they think we have enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| And they're very concerned about the billboards being put out in these scenic areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3048)|
| 0:50:55| And the people just don't want it to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| And I think it's as simple as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| This is a rare opportunity to change how this county looks for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| And we can either do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| And, you know, quite frankly, I'm not too interested in a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| because it seems like if it's a compromise, every time I've tried to compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| I always end up with the short end of the stick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| And I'm afraid that's going to happen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| But really, I think we have to protect these areas that are very beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3083)|
| 0:51:29| And that is, you know, eye pollution or it is light pollution when you put some of these out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3089)|
| 0:51:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3097)|
| 0:51:38| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| A question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| Let's say you have a fast food sign or you have a sign at one of these convenience stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| and the employees go out and change the messages on those signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| Are those regulated by us or is that just up to the business owner once they have that sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3110)|
| 0:51:57| You know, what I'm talking about is, you know, you've got Arby's and they go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| and they say, you know, today, a sandwich, 69 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| But the employees go out and take the numbers or the letters down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| I don't know if Bill regulates those or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| I know that they're allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| One of the provisions of the city's EMC requirements is that if you create an EMC prior to their new prohibition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3134)|
| 0:52:26| you had to take down that changeable reader board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| So it was in part an incentive to get rid of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| But, I mean, are those regulated by us, Mr. Pierce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| They can change those as often as they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| So that's basically the business owner, when they get that and they get the permit for it, they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| I would like to see, you've mentioned several communities that have done this exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3168)|
| 0:52:55| Whether you call it a swap or an exchange or a cap and replace, whatever it is, it's all basically the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| Is it possible, and I know it is, to get their regulations that they have worked out for us to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3180)|
| 0:53:10| and let's see what these other communities have done, how it works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| I would be interested in looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| I haven't seen one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| But I would really like to see that, if it's possible to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| And I know it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| I certainly can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| I don't know that I can get all of them that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| You know, if you could just get us three or four, you know, that you feel would be representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| You have to be a little careful to be able to capture enough of the ordinance to read it in its entirety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3210)|
| 0:53:36| so you know how it works with other sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| But, yeah, there are communities that are identified that we can get the whole ordinance and look through those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3219)|
| 0:53:46| I would be interested in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| And, Mr. Sanders, I know that if you could look at it as well and maybe send us a brief on how that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3227)|
| 0:53:55| From what I hear, from what Mr. Donaldson is saying, and to hear Mr. Sanders say that in Los Angeles there was a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3235)|
| 0:54:02| where you said, did I understand you to say thousands of billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| The document I was referring to was a document prepared by Lamar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| and Lamar supported an ordinance that would have reduced the number of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3250)|
| 0:54:17| I wasn't able to find that that particular proposition was adopted, but Lamar supported it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3257)|
| 0:54:24| But, in other words, there was an opportunity to sit down and talk and compromise, possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| I guess that's where I'm at, is I think there's an opportunity for us to sit down and talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| and see if we can come up with a compromise if other communities are doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| And as Mr. Donaldson has said, it's growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| And if the industry went to Los Angeles, and this is the first I've heard of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| but it's encouraging to me that there was this opportunity to sit down and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| I'm all in favor of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| I was able to find a couple of ordinances that have swap provisions in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| and there is the document that Mr. Donaldson referred to earlier prepared by an attorney in Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| It's online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| It's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| And it goes through and summarizes basically the number of the exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3306)|
| 0:55:13| So here's, for instance, Hayward, California is four to one, it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| Cheyenne, Wyoming, three to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| And some of them, as you go down the list, some of them will swap more traditional billboards for a digital face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3320)|
| 0:55:28| Or if you want to move a traditional face and put it somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| and you have to give up two traditional faces instead of six traditional faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3331)|
| 0:55:38| And there are ways to do it for square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| I found one in Sacramento, California that just said in order to get a permit to move a billboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3344)|
| 0:55:55| the number of total billboards has to be reduced and the number of total square feet has to be reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3355)|
| 0:56:02| It left it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| So you can't just exchange one for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| You have to give up one for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| And some additional square footage here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| Why will it get two for one when you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| Or one that's the same size and one that's a little bit smaller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| So there's any number of ways that you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| And to provide you with the ordinance, I'll have to provide a summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| To provide you with the ordinance is going to be some of these ordinances are burdensome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3385)|
| 0:56:34| I guess, yes, I mean, just to summarize and just say, okay, basically here's how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| And I think you can get down to the nuts and bolts and say, hey, if we were to consider this scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| here's how it's worked in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| Not that we would do that, but at least we can see what other communities have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| There are any number of ways of doing that to reduce the total number of billboards if that's the way you want to go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| It's really going to be up to your constituency and the rest of the board how many they feel comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3415)|
| 0:57:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| Yeah, that 47-page thing that you sent me, I didn't get very far along in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3429)|
| 0:57:16| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| Now, you're going to have to call on Commissioner Smith at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| You can't see his light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| He's asleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| During this ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| I'll just make one more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| You know, if you come up with the mechanics of a swap that you want to do, you can submit that to NPC and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3458)|
| 0:57:47| here, provide us with a plan for a swap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| And we want to exchange a number of billboards for a traditional billboard or a digital billboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| or however you want to do it, and we want to do square footage or either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| NPC can provide you with a plan that has numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| and likely you can make minor changes to that plan, whether it be the numbers or the square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3487)|
| 0:58:17| But if you come up with the basic mechanics, NPC can provide us something that we could use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3497)|
| 0:58:22| that's more flexible than an all-out ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| Because if we made a change to the all-out ban at a county commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| we would have to go back to the NPC for their approval, unless we adopted the ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3508)|
| 0:58:35| We can't say we want to adopt half a ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| That would be a substantial change to the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| We wouldn't be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| Anything else there, Mr. Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| I've lost where my thumb is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| The period during the prohibition or moratorium of billboards, this is a permitting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3533)|
| 0:59:04| Have we received requests for billboards during this four-year period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3544)|
| 0:59:11| No, we have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| So are there any pending from a period of time before the moratorium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| No, there were a few that expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3562)|
| 0:59:23| So we have nothing laying on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| The second question, Mr. Donaldson, the you named a city that you had been following that was looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3565)|
| 0:59:37| I think you said they had a one provider with a certain number of billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| and it's now capped at a certain number of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| The city name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| That was Minnetonka, Minnesota, which is a suburb of Minneapolis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3587)|
| 0:59:54| And the reason I ask that question is because we've had a little bit of discussion about looking at cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| and comparable regulation, but I don't think we've backed up and got cities that are comparable to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3599)|
| 1:00:09| And the reason I say that is because a lot of people pushed out Asheville as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3609)|
| 1:00:16| Their sign ordinances are different or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3616)|
| 1:00:22| I can't determine that by looking at the websites that I've looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| You know, I can read for so many minutes and then I zone out or fall asleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| But for Asheville versus the county, are they in two separate sets of regulation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3634)|
| 1:00:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| Buncombe County, I believe, has their own zoning ordinance and the sign code for the county would be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3643)|
| 1:00:49| And Asheville, you really need to read it in its entirety to see the total picture on signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3649)|
| 1:00:57| They still have billboards, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| Yes, I believe they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| Even in the city of Asheville, I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| One of the other comparisons that we were given was Olathe, Kansas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| And they're kind of straightforward in their zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| But there again, I cannot, I don't think in all honesty, compare Knox County to the city of Olathe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3674)|
| 1:01:24| You know, when we get down to looking at swapping or capping or it's kind of like even if you come into Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3684)|
| 1:01:36| the city of Farragut has rules and regulations that are different from the rest of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3696)|
| 1:01:43| That's my only point in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| Okay, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| Mr. Donaldson, can you do me a favor in the next couple of days or week or so or month or so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3710)|
| 1:01:57| We've debated or discussed and people brought up, you know, Dr. Briggs brought up Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3717)|
| 1:02:03| Can you tell us what areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| There's protected areas, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| You know, Pellissippi is protected from billboards from point A to point B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| Can you tell us what parts of the county outside the city limits are protected from billboards currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3733)|
| 1:02:20| How severe probably is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| I mean, things like can you give us an overview of that, maybe somehow or some way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3741)|
| 1:02:27| Yes, I have the state law on my desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| And it's just a matter of there's six or eight designated routes in Knox County that are scenic highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3751)|
| 1:02:38| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| Going back to what Commissioner Hammond was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| he did a good job starting us off saying this is what is before us are these three items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| And we're talking about compromise and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| But is anybody here before we sit here and try to reinvent the wheel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3773)|
| 1:02:58| Mr. Chairman, I didn't get to hear your opening remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| You may have already covered this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| But is anybody here from the billboard industry that says we agree to some sort of compromise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3780)|
| 1:03:06| Have we looked at any of that tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| Are we going to look at any of that, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| We've heard things throughout the newspapers and things like this and e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3792)|
| 1:03:18| Does the industry want to say anything that would save us some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| as something that they're willing to go along with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| or stuff that they've got their heels dug in the ground that they don't want to make any change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| Why don't we do this, Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| Why don't we see how far this question set goes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| And then if you would like to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| And I know, you know, Ms. Feld is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| Ms. Klein is here, who's been very active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| And if you all want to ask questions, Mr. DeRopp has signed up and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3827)|
| 1:03:53| If you want to ask questions like that, let's see how far this goes and then we'll entertain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3833)|
| 1:03:59| How about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| Okay, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| I'm asking Mr. Donaldson to get these copies for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| It was pointed out a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| I think it would be important to get counties versus cities because we're looking, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3854)|
| 1:04:23| do we need to exactly mirror the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| Is this something that needs to be different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| You've got a different demographics in city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| It was pointed out about Gay Street versus the rest of the city, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| I mean, that's the entertainment center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| It has the place if there's going to be any bright lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| So if we need to look at anything, I think we need to look at counties that would be of similar size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3884)|
| 1:04:50| And also, most importantly to me, what has been the results for those folks there since those changes went into effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3890)|
| 1:05:00| That's the thing we need to look at, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| We don't want to try to approve something that's come back and bite us in the hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3902)|
| 1:05:10| We need to be looking at what's the end result, what's the terminal point on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3910)|
| 1:05:16| You know, I don't want to try to put any industry out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| And I don't think that's the intention of anybody up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| But we need to have some regulations on some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3921)|
| 1:05:27| There's one sign on Chapman Highway there that, man, when you drive by it, you've got to have sunglasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3927)|
| 1:05:33| It's so bright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| So we do need some guidelines on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| But I don't think we're ready to decide yet exactly which way we want to go until we get some of this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3939)|
| 1:05:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| And I wanted to respond to a couple of things that Dr. Briggs had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3949)|
| 1:05:55| Certainly, I'm very sensitive to areas that need to be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3955)|
| 1:06:02| And, of course, that's what I spent three years on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| So in terms of the plan, the Ridgelock plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| And visually, you know, which we didn't really visually, our visual appeal of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3970)|
| 1:06:20| and Knox County is something that we certainly are concerned on and concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3980)|
| 1:06:27| And this is, I guess, to you, Mr. Donaldson, when we talk about areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| and I think of areas all the time that are maybe not on a scenic highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3992)|
| 1:06:37| They're on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| But they're breathtakingly beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=3998)|
| 1:06:44| You know, a forested ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| I'm thinking particularly of on the Holston River, just as the interstate swings around before you go across the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4006)|
| 1:06:53| There's a forested ridge there that's just breathtaking when you're in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| So when we find, I mean, how we can, even if it's not a scenic area, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4018)|
| 1:07:04| it could still be a specified area to be off the table, so to speak, for new billboards or for a digital replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4024)|
| 1:07:14| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| I believe that a program could be crafted, as long as there is rationale for all of the regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4037)|
| 1:07:25| so that you could designate places whereupon a relocated billboard might go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4045)|
| 1:07:34| and from where a replaced billboard must come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| So I think you could create those designated areas for both, you know, the conversions of billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4060)|
| 1:07:48| if you want to go that way, or the relocation of billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| and designate places from which traditional billboards must be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4072)|
| 1:08:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4080)|
| 1:08:01| But one thing, though, let me just, if I can interject just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| The more complicated we make this, of trying to dot all the I's and cross all the T's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4084)|
| 1:08:11| makes it that much more complicated for Bill and his crew to try to regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| and more complicated for the folks that are in the business trying to keep up with how can I do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4096)|
| 1:08:22| Is this, you know, is it okay here at 1st Street and not at 10th Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4102)|
| 1:08:28| Or is it okay at 15th and not 25th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| So we need to keep that in mind, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| And the Pandora's Box effect is one that, of course, the senior national brings up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4116)|
| 1:08:42| This is, is it too much to control?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| And the ban then avoids that Pandora's Box issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4126)|
| 1:08:54| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| Yeah, I just wanted to make a couple more comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| And, you know, I think our enforcers, you know, they really do the best they can with what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4138)|
| 1:09:04| But, you know, but the problem is they can't be everywhere 24 hours a day to see that things are enforced properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4144)|
| 1:09:11| And I think that Mike's correct also is that when you make these things too complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4151)|
| 1:09:17| no one's sure whether it's, you know, whether it's like the people from Scenic Knoxville, the billboard people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4157)|
| 1:09:24| or the code enforcers as to what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| And that's why I'd like to keep it, you know, really simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| And, again, if you really get back to what our citizens say, is what we hear, I think, from the people is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4168)|
| 1:09:34| is that they really don't like the digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| I mean, they probably don't like them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| They really don't like them anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| And, you know, it's whether we care or not what people think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4180)|
| 1:09:46| The other comment or the other question that I had about this deals with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| we've talked a lot about these conversions that they've had elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| Is there any litigation going on in these places such as Los Angeles where they've made these conversions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4195)|
| 1:10:01| Because sometimes you end up with more litigation when you make the conversions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| and, you know, people are suing about whether that was legal or not legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| or do you open another can of worms when you have something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4208)|
| 1:10:14| Because I believe there's litigation going on in Los Angeles over these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| I'm not aware of any litigation over the swap programs that have been enacted in various places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4218)|
| 1:10:24| Because I think Los Angeles also has a ban on new billboards, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| Well, there are a string of cases that address billboard bans and what's legal and what's not legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4228)|
| 1:10:39| And those go back to the early 80s and more recently to the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4239)|
| 1:10:46| and a lot of them have been in California where there's a lot of billboards there, a lot of billboards there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4246)|
| 1:10:53| Because, I mean, I could even see where, you know, you do permit billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| and then you end up with lawsuits over enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| Is it a legal billboard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| Is it not a legal billboard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| And, you know, and then you, you know, I like, you know, I'm sort of a simple guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4261)|
| 1:11:08| I think just to have things black or white, if we want digital billboards, you know, here, so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| If we don't, let's just say, let's just decide what we want and not, you know, don't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| And then just live with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| Okay, it's 516.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4283)|
| 1:11:28| We have no more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| Are there any members of the board that would like to ask another question or another aspect of this discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4289)|
| 1:11:37| Well, you know, we normally allow five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| And I think if we have two people signed up and said they would like to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| I'd like to hear what those two folks have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| And why don't we do that then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| If there's no objection, we'll allow the folks that have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| What I would hope that you would do is that there particularly would be a focus on what the discussion has been about today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4313)|
| 1:12:02| as opposed to what we've already covered in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| So is there any other directed questions that want to go towards anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4327)|
| 1:12:14| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| I just want to leave with the understanding that we are going to get some summaries of these other communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4336)|
| 1:12:22| whether it's a city or a county is immaterial to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| I just want to see what the concept is so we can look at a concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| And so we are going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| And are we going to get that before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| I guess I'm looking at a time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| I know we have holidays, and I don't want to give anybody any undue work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| We're going to consider this in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| Could we say we'll have it right after the first of the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| Yes, Ms. Feld, come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4366)|
| 1:12:53| Would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| Would you like to have five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| Well, I don't think I need five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| I was just going to say I did call the office today to sign up, and I was told that you couldn't sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4377)|
| 1:13:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4383)|
| 1:13:04| We did try to avoid the public forum thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| Well, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| You're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| Why don't you do the name and address thing and go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| I'm Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| I live at 1540 Ogilvie Avenue, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| And thank you for coming today and trying to learn more about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| And thank you also for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4404)|
| 1:13:29| I just am going to be brief about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| I want to say that you're looking for a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| I think we've already compromised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| I think it's very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| We've already done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| We've allowed over 400 billboard faces in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| We've allowed commercial interest to take over our public, public streetscapes and view sheds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4425)|
| 1:13:53| and that's been our compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| And I think enough is enough, and we don't need more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| And we definitely don't need digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| You really do need to listen to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| They really hate those things and they really don't want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| As for L.A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4448)|
| 1:14:09| and I will send you some information on that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| I'm a little familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| I've been following it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| There are 100 digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| First of all, L.A. has a ban on new billboards, as do many, many, many cities in California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| I was recently in Northern California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| There are very few billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| In San Diego last year, they've had a ban on new billboards since 1980 or 83 or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4468)|
| 1:14:36| That ban was challenged in court and ruled to be illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| In L.A., there are 100 digital billboards and they are in litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| They were allowed to convert by city council after the billboard ban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4487)|
| 1:14:54| and there was no opportunity for public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| And actually, the litigation was actually started by another billboard company because they weren't allowed a piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4499)|
| 1:15:09| of the pie and they weren't allowed to make any conversions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| It was only one company that was allowed to make them, but the public has also joined in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4513)|
| 1:15:18| It's expected to, a decision is expected very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| The judge did issue a preliminary opinion in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| And I'm not a lawyer, but it's not looking good for the digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| So that has been tied up in litigation for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| Mr. DeRob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4541)|
| 1:15:47| Not to weigh the discussion too heavily one side or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| if some of the folks from the industry would like to speak also, of course, you're invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4551)|
| 1:15:57| Go ahead, Mr. DeRob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| Thank you, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| Jim DeRob from Maloney Road in South Knoxville, 4126.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4560)|
| 1:16:07| I just want to mention one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| Lakemore Hills Neighborhood Association, which represents 450 homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4570)|
| 1:16:17| of which half of the association are members, has sent Commissioner Briggs a letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4577)|
| 1:16:26| a copy to Mike Brown, and requesting that the commission support the bans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4586)|
| 1:16:36| With that said, I would just like to reemphasize one thing or emphasize a point that was made by Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4596)|
| 1:16:44| And that's he asked, are there any communities that have banned billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4604)|
| 1:16:57| electronic message centers, or digital billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| And then said, we so regret that we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4622)|
| 1:17:08| We need to revisit that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| We need to go back and bring and revisit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| I would challenge anyone to identify one community in the United States that has taken some action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4636)|
| 1:17:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4647)|
| 1:17:28| Thank you, Mr. DeRob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| Ms. Duesen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| Not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| Ms. Kline, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4657)|
| 1:17:44| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| Margo Kline, 8845 Ebenezer Oaks Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| And I certainly won't take five minutes either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| I just had a couple of things I had thought you probably would mention among yourselves that didn't come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4671)|
| 1:17:57| So I wanted to bring them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| I understand that when we're talking about billboards in Knox County, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| we mean the unincorporated part of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| But I don't know if the general public hears that sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| And when it's in the paper and they read that there are 402 billboard faces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4690)|
| 1:18:17| they may think that's from one end of the county to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| And I believe Mr. Pierce's office did state there a total of 914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4700)|
| 1:18:28| And that's in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| That's including what's in the city limits and the unincorporated part and in the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| So I just wanted to hopefully put that out there for everyone to know because we do feel, as Joyce said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4715)|
| 1:18:42| that that is quite a lot of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| The other thing is that there's some concerns talked about on enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| And I have been communicating some with Mr. Pierce's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4730)|
| 1:18:54| And I really appreciate everything they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| I don't think that they have the staff or the money to enforce new laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4737)|
| 1:19:03| So if you allow these things, and the reason I say that is because there are some operating out there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4743)|
| 1:19:10| that are not functioning as the current ordinance says they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4750)|
| 1:19:16| And I know that because I've gone out and done videotapes of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| And Mr. Pierce said that here in the city county building you all can't see YouTube.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| So I put together two digital versions, a DVD and a CD, that I would like to give for the record for anyone to be able to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4764)|
| 1:19:34| And it's not horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4774)|
| 1:19:35| Sometimes it's churches, you know, and they're saying when they're going to have their church meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4775)|
| 1:19:40| and their divorced parents groups and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| But they are not operating according to what the ordinance says they should be now in terms of whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4783)|
| 1:19:51| They're not supposed to have full animation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| The lettering is supposed to be a certain size so they can be easily read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4794)|
| 1:19:58| They're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| So, I mean, I truly do feel that it's going to be a headache and a nightmare of enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4799)|
| 1:20:06| So not to be too critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| I just really feel like that is something that needs to be talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4808)|
| 1:20:13| The other thing is that the TDOT and the state law has a number of regulations on scrolling, animation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4813)|
| 1:20:21| blinking, placement of red lights next to stoplights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4821)|
| 1:20:27| That's where we're in violation on that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| And I wonder if we're not going to have some lawsuits on that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| I know we're a home rural county, but do we go around what the state law says in this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4833)|
| 1:20:40| Do we have to follow TDOT's regulations on spacing when we talk about taking down a few billboards in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4840)|
| 1:20:48| to put up or convert a different billboard to digital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| Are we going to do any in the city for one in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| Is it going to be only county billboards that are static have to come down to put up a digital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4856)|
| 1:21:02| I just hope you all will look at all those questions because it's a tough, complex topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4862)|
| 1:21:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4868)|
| 1:21:09| And can I give these to someone up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| Thank you, Ms. Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| Ms. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| Let me just give this little side bit of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| I talked to a friend of mine today who got hit two days ago by a lady who stopped to read a digital billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4883)|
| 1:21:32| She wanted to wait until it changed again so she could see what was coming up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4892)|
| 1:21:38| That's not what I want to say in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| I think that the tone of the discussions that we've had so far, my belief is that I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4900)|
| 1:21:53| and I think the tone has kind of gone that way with our discussions is that we're okay right now with the no more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4913)|
| 1:22:01| no additional billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| But the meat is going to be in what we're going to do with what we got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| and how we're going to regulate the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| I mean, I think that the first resolution or ordinance is not a big problem for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4929)|
| 1:22:15| I mean, that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| Thanks to everyone who spoke, and I would agree with Ms. Klein wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| It is a tough, complex issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| And that's why we're having this workshop is so that we can gather information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| and so that we can have all of the facts before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| I've counted three times now where we have been told that we need to listen to our constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4954)|
| 1:22:39| and I would argue that that's exactly what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| We have heard from Scenic Knoxville, who definitely has a point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4962)|
| 1:22:46| We have heard from some homeowner groups who have a point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| We've heard from the billboard industry that has a point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| We've heard from small businesses who use billboards and who use them very effectively to increase their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4972)|
| 1:22:58| That's a point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| We have heard from charities who use billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| That is a point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| So I guess I would argue that we are listening to our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| That's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| And that's why we're coming into a tough, complex issue to try to get facts and information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4988)|
| 1:23:13| But I know I'm listening to everybody, and I appreciate everybody's input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4993)|
| 1:23:19| But somehow the notion that if I don't vote your way, then I'm not listening to constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| I frankly find that, well, I won't say what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| But this is why I believe that we need information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| This is why I think we need the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| And I think this is why we need to have just a good discussion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| And I'm very pleased with the discussion today and where we're going with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| because I haven't made up my mind on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| But I do want to get facts and information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| But I do want to make it clear I am listening to my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| Anybody that calls and wants to talk with me, I'm more than happy to call and answer e-mails and to have discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5031)|
| 1:23:57| And so I invite anybody in the community who has a point of view on this, call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5037)|
| 1:24:02| because I want to hear from all cross-sections of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5048)|
| 1:24:09| We have another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5050)|
| 1:24:11| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| Danny Ammons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| I live at 4704 Meredith Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| And I appreciate you all, and I'll take a very short amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| I appreciate you allowing comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| Two things that I think you may take into consideration, I'm no attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| but as you talk about communities and looking at possible cap-and-trade or swap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5072)|
| 1:24:38| you may want to look at Tennessee communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| From my understanding, there's some Tennessee law that somewhat limits that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5080)|
| 1:24:46| So that may be a consideration that you all look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| And then secondly, I just seems like we lose sight of in all the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5090)|
| 1:24:56| or it is belittled the fact that prior to the moratorium, there was not an onslaught of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5096)|
| 1:25:04| And documentation from Bill Pierce's office has shown that on average over 20 years there was four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5104)|
| 1:25:12| average of four permits a year made in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| A year and a half if you want to take all the way back to 25 years when they were first starting to permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| because there was quite a few that were being permitted that existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| So in light of that, you're looking at a swap to try to hold still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5123)|
| 1:25:29| or reduce when a document from the state of Tennessee has shown in Knox County just in a roughly year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5129)|
| 1:25:36| and a half there was roughly 40 faces that were removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| So you've already had a reduction in these past four years of billboards that's documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5139)|
| 1:25:45| So you're having a reduction of permits and signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| So if you want to say you're cleaning up, Knoxville because of business and because of supply and demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5149)|
| 1:25:56| and because of good business is reducing the number of billboards that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5156)|
| 1:26:02| They're being taken down by businesses and by homeowners without you all having to cap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| and trade and to come up with a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| That's the reason I'm still amazed that we're here talking about a compromise from industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| when we have compromised so much in our ordinances to get us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| And then over the last, we are showing that there's a reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| If you all would back out and make some good choices to deal with issues that brought this up like the digital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5185)|
| 1:26:32| which created some light problems, some scrolling problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| and if you instead of taking a broad spectrum would look at the individual things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| and make a simple ruling on those, the rest of it seems to take care of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| And I just wanted to bring that to light after all the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| Thank you, Mr. Emmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| Do we have others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5213)|
| 1:26:58| And I appreciate all the people who have spoken of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| You've given us some new information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| You're addressing things that we took up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| My name is Gary Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| I reside at 10040 Casa Real Cove in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5231)|
| 1:27:18| First, I appreciate the fact that you guys are really trying to learn a little bit about the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5238)|
| 1:27:24| It affects a lot of people, both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| And I commend you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| You spend an awful lot of time doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| And I appreciate it as a voter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| Back in about 1987, I've been in outdoor advertising for about 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| I was managing Lamar Advertising when we did the county ordinance about 25 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5258)|
| 1:27:47| I hadn't done the numbers because I got out of the corporate world and went in my own business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| But Danny said that there had been about four permits per year over a 20- or 25-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5272)|
| 1:28:03| That's not an overbill situation in a 25-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| When we passed the ordinance in 1980, I think seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| I think it was something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| I don't remember exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| We had a strong purpose at the time of improving the quality, which we did, requiring expensive structures, which we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5294)|
| 1:28:26| You can't go out and build telephone pole structures anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| That's banned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| We did away with stacking them, making more single faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| We improved the spacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| That's the way you control the zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| That's the way you control the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| We doubled the spacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| Before 1987, billboards could be 300 or so feet apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| We doubled it to 750, and I think that's radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| which means they can be as far apart as almost 1,490 feet for a new permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5338)|
| 1:29:08| So if you've got a board 1,000 feet or 1,200 feet apart, that's not an overbill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5348)|
| 1:29:14| We tried to listen to the other side back in the 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5354)|
| 1:29:18| Basically, except for the LED question, the same problems they had then they have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5358)|
| 1:29:27| And we tried to address that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| And I think four permits a year over 20, 25 years indicates that you have a pretty good base ordinance currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5370)|
| 1:29:42| Because it has reduced the number, it has spread them out, and it has required a higher quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| That's allowed the industry to adapt to changing market conditions when they've been allowed to relocate and move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5388)|
| 1:29:57| But they're further apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| I can show you locations in the county where that's happened, examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5399)|
| 1:30:03| And there are plenty of locations out there where they're still 300 feet apart perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| But as development happens, I'm telling you, the new ordinance or the ordinance that requires more spacing has had an effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5408)|
| 1:30:17| And it's not killed the businesses that need this product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| I've been in it a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| I haven't forced anybody, never, to pay me a dollar to rent one of my billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| They do it voluntarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| Secondly, the focus on the discussion is the billboard structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5430)|
| 1:30:41| The state of Tennessee is a property rights state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| So you need to get some input from the law department on TCA 137208, 13-7208.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5444)|
| 1:30:54| That is a property rights protection code or statute that says when you have a non-conforming structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5454)|
| 1:31:05| that that structure, when it comes down, the use remains with the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5465)|
| 1:31:13| That's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| Until you, the property owner, decide to terminate that use, abandon it legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5475)|
| 1:31:23| the government takes it through eminent domain, or it's been put up illegally in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| That's the only three ways to get rid of a non-conforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5488)|
| 1:31:34| I happened to win some lawsuits back in the 80s that established that outdoor advertising was a structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5494)|
| 1:31:42| And it's applied since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| So you need to, not to complicate the issue, but the focus has been on the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5505)|
| 1:31:52| But really and truly, the question you need to address, and it's been litigated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5512)|
| 1:32:00| is the non-conforming use has to disappear underneath that non-conforming structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5520)|
| 1:32:07| Because if a structure is taken down, you can rebuild it by law, by property right law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5527)|
| 1:32:17| So you can take them down, but that doesn't mean the use is gone unless the property owner has legally abandoned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5537)|
| 1:32:24| So I just wanted to interject that, not to complicate the issue, but it's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5544)|
| 1:32:31| Okay, thank you, Mr. Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| I had just a question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| I guess that means that you really can't do a swap, whereas if a property owner has a billboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5556)|
| 1:32:42| and you take three billboards down and put in another one, then you really don't have the right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5562)|
| 1:32:50| I can see how it would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| Well, I mean, the property owner may not want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| Oh, that's very true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5577)|
| 1:32:58| If he has to, if this is a property rights state, then the swaps wouldn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| Well, the property owner would have to voluntarily abandon, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5582)|
| 1:33:07| he'd have to legally abandon that spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5587)|
| 1:33:12| And that gets to Mr. Shouse's issue about the economy of someone giving that right up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5592)|
| 1:33:21| And so why don't we let Mr. Sanders investigate this and get back to us at our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5601)|
| 1:33:30| Okay, thank you, Mr. Douglas, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| Okay, it's getting close to dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5615)|
| 1:33:41| We look like we've got another guy who's going to hold up dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| I'll just take one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| Okay, go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| My name is Brian Conley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| I'm the Vice President for Lamar Advertising here at 3009 West Industrial Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| You know, one thing I want to say is I really appreciate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| the commissioners coming together and talking about a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| And I want to say I know someone, maybe it was Commissioner Smith, brought up, you know, the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5640)|
| 1:34:06| I'm sure, you know, compromise can be reached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| And from the time I've got here, that is one thing that I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| I do believe that if we sat down together, it is a complicated, you know, thing when you start looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5652)|
| 1:34:18| But you can simplify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| And I do think that if we sat down together, you know, us, you know, Joyce, whoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| and we could come up with a compromise as long as everyone is willing to give something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| And, you know, as Lamar, I'm here to tell you, I mean, we're willing to compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| So, like I said, I think that was Commissioner Smith, you know, asking that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| I just want to say we are willing to compromise because we understand there is room for regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5678)|
| 1:34:45| So, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| Thank you, Mr. Connelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| Mr. Connelly, I just thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| And if you all want to share that with us, I mean, it would save us from beating our heads against the wall that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| you know, if you're willing to compromise on some things, let's start with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| and then see where we go, you know, what else is out there, what, Joyce, what you all need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5699)|
| 1:35:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| Mr. Sanders, you got an assignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| And thanks for everybody's participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| We'll be taking this up again at the workshop and at the monthly meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| And have a safe return home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121129Special?start=5718)|
