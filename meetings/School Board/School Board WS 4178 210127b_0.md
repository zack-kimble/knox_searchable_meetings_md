| 0:02:03| in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| Also, board members, I wanted just to let you know that commission has created the Redistricting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=125)|
| 0:02:13| Committee, and this will take the census information, and the committee will analyze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=133)|
| 0:02:25| current districts and make changes based on the populations as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=145)|
| 0:02:32| So the committee will consist of the 11 commissioners, the board of education chair, and the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=152)|
| 0:02:41| commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| So that, we will not have the information for that committee until probably, it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=163)|
| 0:02:49| probably be a few weeks, but the big thing will be is that you guys may get questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| about, the public may confuse that with rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| So we will ask the superintendent to send some information out as we get closer so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=178)|
| 0:03:05| can make sure that people aren't confused about redistricting and that it's not actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=189)|
| 0:03:16| Any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| Go ahead, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| I do, but it can wait because we'll have discussion, but will it, so the redistricting will affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=198)|
| 0:03:26| the amount of, like our districts as board members though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| But not the kids' schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| Our districts as board members line up with our commissioners' districts, so, and we'll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=216)|
| 0:03:44| as we get further information, you'll be aware of it and you can always provide input as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=224)|
| 0:03:50| you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=230)|

| 0:03:56| Do we have any changes to this agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=236)|

| 0:04:47| Of course, we can't do that this year, but we're very excited that players from the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| Ice Bears hockey team will be making a virtual appearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=291)|

| 0:05:11| on Tuesday, February 23rd at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=311)|

| 0:05:17| Again, I'm very excited to announce that every KCS teacher will be invited to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=317)|
| 0:05:22| this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| In such a challenging year, each of our teachers has gone above and beyond the call of duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| I cannot think of a better time to open this event to our entire teaching staff, and my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| hope is that this event will help our educators understand how much we do appreciate them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| and what they do every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| I'm also very excited that John Maxwell will be our guest speaker at the Teacher of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| Year celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| Mr. Maxwell is a leadership expert and is the best-selling author of more than 100 books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| and I think our attendees will find him inspiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| And this week is School Board Appreciation Week in the state of Tennessee, so we appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| you so much and we're trying to show our appreciation each day this week to you, so we wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=358)|

| 0:06:11| I can only imagine how challenging it is to serve on the Board of Education, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| year has been particularly difficult as we have wrestled with so many related obstacles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=375)|
| 0:06:22| I guess, related to COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| So it's been a difficult year for everyone, and I know for you, too, with all the challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=385)|
| 0:06:31| Our district's ability to offer both in-person and virtual instruction for nearly 60,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=391)|
| 0:06:37| students is a testament to the Board's leadership and their commitment to finding the best solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| So on behalf of our students, families, and employees, I want to thank each of our Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| members for their service, and I hope that members of our community will take a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| to thank them this week, and hopefully tomorrow's Thursday, day after is Friday, maybe there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| will be another surprise coming your way, maybe, so be on the lookout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=416)|
| 0:07:03| So thank you so much, Madam Chair, and that concludes my report for this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| Thank you, Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| I appreciate all the nice little treats this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=429)|
| 0:07:16| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| Very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| Okay, we will turn to our first agenda item, and I would like to introduce Human Resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=439)|
| 0:07:26| Executive Director Scott Bolton, and this is as a follow-up conversation to the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| we had around superintendent's evaluation at our September workshop, and so I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| to just go ahead and turn it over to Mr. Bolton, and he can get us started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| Madam Chair, Board members, thank you for this opportunity to kind of walk you through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| the evaluation process this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| Just to kind of follow up where we talked about, and what we talked about in the spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| and the conversation about the current model that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| So what you should see is something similar that we, the metrics, now I have pulled out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| those metrics that can be scored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| These are reflective of the metrics that we've had problems with scoring over the last couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| of iterations of the superintendent evaluation, and as you know, timing is an issue, and student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=493)|
| 0:08:22| achievement data has been an issue, and so if you look at this document, and it's a similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=502)|
| 0:08:29| document that I presented in the fall, but you'll see, based on that document, the dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=509)|
| 0:08:35| when those accountability measures that could be implemented into the model are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| for us to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| So in looking at, typically, as we look at the timing for the superintendent evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=523)|
| 0:08:51| the standard is prior to the July meeting, or as soon as reasonably possible, I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| I'm saying that, as soon as practically possible, I think is the terminology that we're using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=536)|
| 0:09:02| If we followed on prior to the July meeting, then we would continue for a third year having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=542)|
| 0:09:09| NAs in those categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| And having a conversation with Mr. Dupler about the process, a suggested timeline, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| know, an ideal timeline if we look that would satisfy all of these, would certainly be November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=558)|
| 0:09:24| You'll see that in the second document that I included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| Ideally in the future, and thinking about evaluations, that would be the ideal timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=568)|
| 0:09:36| You never have to worry about the availability of data. You never have to worry about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=576)|
| 0:09:43| timing of elections, throwing off the superintendent evaluations, because that becomes an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=583)|
| 0:09:50| when it's in an election year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| So ideally, the timing of a superintendent evaluation would take place in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=592)|
| 0:10:00| In light of all of that, this year, Gary and I engaged in a conversation about the availability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=600)|
| 0:10:07| of this data and not having to score for a third year those categories in A. It could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| be postponed until November to score the evaluation of the superintendent as soon as reasonably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=613)|
| 0:10:22| or practically possible because all data will be in and the scoring would be complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| if the evaluation, if it was the pleasure of the board for the evaluation to be completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| in November rather than being completed in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| And so that is essentially the premise of what I have to present to you is kind of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=636)|
| 0:10:44| proposal for consideration to think about postponing the evaluation until November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=644)|
| 0:10:52| And as you know, last year when we took up the evaluation process, student achievement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| data would not have been available given that it was the pandemic. So whether we completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=658)|
| 0:11:04| the evaluation in July or completed the evaluation in November, it would have been the same either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=670)|
| 0:11:10| But this year, a complete evaluation could be completed in November without any issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=670)|
| 0:11:18| as I understand it. So I would be happy to take any questions if anybody has any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| Okay, Mr. Bolton, one question. So when you are saying it could be completed in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| is that and then we would discuss it at the end of January or are you saying discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| in November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=693)|
| 0:11:33| I am saying...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| Or we could do really either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| Right. Complete the full evaluation in November. It would take place and probably a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| call board meeting in November. We would just back up. If you look at the timelines of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| I have suggested for a January ideal date, you back up those same times and those same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=705)|
| 0:11:52| timelines for that evaluation to take place in November. All data we will have in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=712)|
| 0:12:01| So we could go through that process in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| Okay. All right. Mr. Dupley, would you like to add something to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| Thank you, Madam Chair. Yes, Mr. Bolton came to me and we just... He came to me with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| proposal and we took a look at it and he was thinking January, but after looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=735)|
| 0:12:22| the applicable board policy and the superintendent's contract, the board would not want to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=742)|
| 0:12:29| in January because that would essentially be in the next year because an evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| has to be done annually. So that is when we came up with, well, you are probably better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| off going late in the year, which would be ideally November, but it could be December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=760)|
| 0:12:48| depending upon how the numbers fall and things like that. So that is where we came up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=768)|
| 0:12:56| this. But this is a proposal, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| Thank you so much for that. Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| I guess thinking about it, data wise, I like the fact of November, but then we run into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| the every other year on elections. We would have, I mean, sometimes there is hardly any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| new board members, but you could have a huge changeover of board members of a board that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| really does not have any experience with the superintendent trying to evaluate them. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| that is, it is like a catch-22, like we can't kind of win either way we do it because, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| mean, I do like the fact of having the data. That is, you know, I am one of the ones that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| had problems with the lack of information that we had. And I guess it is more of an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| every other year problem, too, on the elections. But I just think that is something else we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| just need to bring into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| Okay. Mr. Duplant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| I can address that as well. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Ms. Babb. So legally the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=826)|
| 0:13:53| evaluation, the superintendent's evaluation has to be done either 45 days before the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| or 30 days after the election, which obviously does not apply this year, but would next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=838)|
| 0:14:05| Okay. In thinking about that, I am wondering if this would work. And I know in this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=845)|
| 0:14:12| we have talked about the fact that sometimes in the past the board has chosen to do a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| month if it is an election year. So this year, since we don't have that issue, perhaps we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=858)|
| 0:14:24| could do it in November 2021. But then the next year you could not. In 2022 you couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=864)|
| 0:14:34| But you couldn't then go into 2023 because then you are in a different year. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| Well, you can do it 30 days after the election. But you are having, if there is a huge turnover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| in the board, you are having board members that literally are evaluating a superintendent they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| really don't have much experience with. So that is the only issue I see with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| So you could do November, December time frame, but you just would have brand new board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=895)|
| 0:15:02| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| Yes, thank you Madam Chair. So if we, I want to make sure I am clear on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| so in the election years it has to be done within 30 days or prior to 45?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| Yeah, it has to be done prior to 45 days before the election or after 30 days after. So I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=914)|
| 0:15:21| there is a window, 45 before and 30 days after, it can't be done in that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| It can't be done within that window. Okay. So is there a possibility, I am not suggesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| I am not saying that I necessarily love this, I am trying to see what the options are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| is there a possibility for us to, as the board, if it is a board policy and not being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| dictated by law, can we suspend that policy for this year and move it to an ideal time frame of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| January 2022? So, that is an interesting question. So the state law is the time frame, but I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=943)|
| 0:15:56| what you are saying is… Earlier you had referenced policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| is that you can do it annually. It is the superintendent's contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| if I am not mistaken. Right, right, right. You have got the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| superintendent's contract. Policy also calls for annually, but it doesn't specify whether that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=963)|
| 0:16:11| school year or calendar year. It just says annually. So there is some room to wiggle there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=971)|
| 0:16:20| but I mean state law, I mean you wouldn't be able to get around. Policy, you may be able to tweak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| something. And the state law issue is only the election piece of that, or what is the state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| issue? Well, the state law does say annually as well, but again, it doesn't specify what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| mean by annually. Exactly. Right, right. Okay. So, it seems like we always have the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=996)|
| 0:16:45| conversation and we are always right back to where we started. So, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| Thank you, Madam Chair. This is just a thought. I don't know how receptive the Board would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1010)|
| 0:17:00| but I think that if we move it back and forth, you know, one year, it is in one month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1020)|
| 0:17:09| sometime later it is in January, it would not only be confusing for maybe school personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1029)|
| 0:17:18| but the public as well, ones that care, or were interested, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1038)|
| 0:17:28| You can have it since the August election is what we are talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1048)|
| 0:17:38| You could have it beginning sometime in the second week in October, could you not, Mr. Dupin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1058)|
| 0:17:48| As far as starting working on the evaluation, and then do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1068)|
| 0:17:56| wind it up, and have your special meeting in November. That would give you basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1076)|
| 0:18:05| 50 days plus to work on it. Sure, sure. Like you said, Mr. McMillan, you could start it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1085)|
| 0:18:14| I mean you wouldn't have your full information until probably later in October, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| yeah, by all means you could start it. But you could get the things done that you already knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1099)|
| 0:18:26| about with the exception of the data. That would seem more logical to me, just setting it something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1106)|
| 0:18:34| like that, do it, get it out of the way, probably before the holidays begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1114)|
| 0:18:44| Thank you. Ms. Fab, I agree with Mr. McMillan that I don't like us switching back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1124)|
| 0:18:51| every year. I think you do need to have some consistency on when it is. My big thing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1131)|
| 0:18:59| looking at when the data is ready. I think that's the whole point of us changing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| if we change it, is to have all the data. I think we need to look at that, if it can be ready end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| of October, great, but if we think it's more like first of November, then I think first of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| November would be, we need to do it when the data is ready, because that would be the only reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| we're really moving this instrument anyway. Correct. So what if we looked at doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1157)|
| 0:19:26| because the other big issue that we've talked about is asking Mr. Bolton to come to one of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| work sessions and just walk through the evaluation with us, with all of us, prior to filling it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1171)|
| 0:19:39| to make sure that everybody's on the same page. So what if we looked at doing that at our quarterly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| work session, which is on September 29th, and then we would have basically the month of October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1184)|
| 0:19:52| to complete those and then have the call meeting in November to review the evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1192)|
| 0:20:02| Would that be appropriate? That works perfect with me, as long as it's a pleasure to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1202)|
| 0:20:10| I'm sorry, Ms. Satterfield. Yes, I just want to lift up a perspective that the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| to what Board Member Babs mentioned, that is like the catch-22, but I feel like the data might just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1216)|
| 0:20:23| is the priority. If we do have a completely new board, if the rubric is pretty, is tight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| and the data is the data, and the data says that superintendent is great or superintendent is bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| then the new school board members should be able to have that level of neutral to look at the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1234)|
| 0:20:41| to say yes or no. So I think we should focus on having a tight rubric versus trying to fix the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| dates and make sure that rubric is evaluating him to the truest, or whoever it may be, to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| truest sense. Okay, I'm not sure who was first. Go ahead, Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1253)|
| 0:21:02| So because I haven't, I wasn't on the board and I haven't reviewed the superintendent's contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| can you explain specifically what it is about the contract that said it would have to be done this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| calendar year and not to January? I don't have the contract in front. Do you have the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1271)|
| 0:21:20| Great, thank you. Look at them. My recollection is, as Mr. Bolton's, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1280)|
| 0:21:27| that it has to be done as soon as practical. Right, I got it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| So the exact language is, beginning in 2018, the evaluation shall take place prior to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1293)|
| 0:21:42| board's regular July meeting of each year or as soon thereafter as practicable. So that's what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1302)|
| 0:21:49| kind of tripping the board up right now, is because that's written into the contract. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| as Mr. Bolton indicated, the soon thereafter as practicable would allow this board to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1314)|
| 0:22:02| delay that once this board has that objective data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1322)|
| 0:22:10| Yeah, I think, I mean, I appreciate, Mr. Bolton, how you started the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| this evening. You talked about the ideal time. And I think if there's a way for us to, as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| to move it to January, where we have the data, it doesn't impact new board members as much in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| terms of being able to do it in the long term. And I know it means pushing it two months. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| I know that flips the calendar year when we do that. But if there's a way to do that, and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1350)|
| 0:22:36| there's policy against it, but I don't know if we can temporarily suspend the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| And it sounds like the contract and both state law are kind of fuzzy on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| Again, I don't know if there's a way to do it, Mr. Dukler, but I think that's what I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| advocate for, is try to get to a rhythm where this board isn't having this conversation two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| or three years from now. And people are like, oh, this is in the sweet spot. You know what I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| saying? Okay. Mr. McMillan. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Dukler, does state law actually say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1376)|
| 0:23:07| that the superintendent shall be evaluated annually? Mr. Dukler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1387)|
| 0:23:15| Yes, but that's basically all it says. I mean, it doesn't say how. Well, it is state law. If it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1395)|
| 0:23:23| says the superintendent will be evaluated annually, that means to me that you should evaluate him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1403)|
| 0:23:32| sometime during the year, not skip and pick and choose. Now, I misspoke, I think, a while ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1412)|
| 0:23:40| when I said October, because the local election is held the first week in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1420)|
| 0:23:51| So, theoretically, you said 30 days after. We could start any time beginning with the second week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1431)|
| 0:24:01| in September. And if we didn't do the final analysis, I guess, until mid-November or whenever in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1441)|
| 0:24:13| I would think that was ample time for anyone to get even a new board member. And if they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1453)|
| 0:24:21| uncomfortable with it, you know, there's nothing that says that you absolutely have to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1461)|
| 0:24:31| To my knowledge, would that not be correct, Mr. Dukler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| Thank you, Madam Chair. Well, yeah, I mean, again, there's not much guidance from the state, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1475)|
| 0:24:51| McMillan. I mean, what I've told you is basically the guidance. And yeah, there's no penalty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| for a board member abstaining. Okay, that's what I want to know. I mean, if we had, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1497)|
| 0:25:07| two new board members and they chose or one of them chose not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1507)|
| 0:25:18| render a vote, well, there wouldn't be anything wrong with that. Majority of the board would rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| assuming that five or more voted one way or another, correct? Right, there's nothing legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1524)|
| 0:25:32| that says you can't do that. Thank you. Thank you. Ms. Noland, do you have your mic down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| I do, Madam Chair. Okay, go right ahead. I'm going to go a little different direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1537)|
| 0:25:45| So, what I'm hearing are concerns about having new board members have to do an evaluation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| they were not a part of, but also having the data in time, as well as the contract that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1551)|
| 0:25:58| it has to be done in July. So, what if we did it in July with whatever board members were there in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1558)|
| 0:26:05| July with all the parts that are available and then REA fill in the data when it becomes available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1565)|
| 0:26:16| so that the subjective part would be completed by the board members in July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1576)|
| 0:26:22| and then the objective part would be completed by REA whenever that was available, October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| November. But that doesn't work with the election because the election, if it's the first week of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| August, would take you 45 days back to June, July, whichever, whenever we normally do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1593)|
| 0:26:40| is what I was intending, so that it would be done as normal and then when the data became| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1600)|
| 0:26:48| available it would just be plugged in to complete that whole process. I want to speak again. Sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1608)|
| 0:26:55| Mr. McMillan. I think we're trying to make this too complicated. Let's assume that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1615)|
| 0:27:03| new board members that come on. Then, if you follow your scenario, do it in, it would probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1623)|
| 0:27:14| have to be done in June in order to meet the 45-day requirement. Then, you have a new board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1634)|
| 0:27:21| member or members that come in, let's just say for argument's sake, that we change superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1641)|
| 0:27:29| Then, they would come in and not have any opportunity for a year to voice their concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1649)|
| 0:27:38| about whoever the superintendent was. You see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1658)|
| 0:27:49| I mean, do you think that would be fair to new board members coming in to not have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1669)|
| 0:27:57| to vote on whoever the existing superintendent was because the board member prior to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1677)|
| 0:28:10| had voted before they came out? I didn't do a very good job of explaining it, but I think you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1690)|
| 0:28:22| should be able to see what I'm talking about. Would you want that done to you if you were the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1702)|
| 0:28:28| new board member coming in? I think it's much better to do it like I said and then you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1708)|
| 0:28:38| the option, but you always have the choice of voting yay or nay or just abstaining if you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1718)|
| 0:28:48| it from September to November. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. McMillan. Ms. Owen, did you have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1728)|
| 0:28:56| follow-up? Yes. You're talking about voting on the superintendent's contract. Is that what you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1736)|
| 0:29:06| So, I think that would be a question of whether that would be necessarily tied to that year's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1746)|
| 0:29:13| evaluation because it's usually two different, really two different conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| Because aren't we usually a couple of years out on that? It's not an immediate action. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1760)|
| 0:29:27| Typically, the evaluation will be separate from the contract. It could happen that it's the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| timing, but not necessarily. You're right about that, but I still just think that's just my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1773)|
| 0:29:40| opinion, but I think you're trying to, you know, complicate matters. Yeah. I just think it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| be better to set it and go. I know what my recommendation is going to be, but let's go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| ahead and have a couple more comments from Ms. Christie. She hasn't gotten to speak. Yeah, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| agree with what Ms. Satterfield said. I mean, my problem is more with the evaluation itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| I think if we have a good evaluation and we have the data that a new person should be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1801)|
| 0:30:09| navigate through it, and let's face it, if you are running for school board, I would hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| you're somewhat engaged and know a little bit about what's going on in the district prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1814)|
| 0:30:20| being sworn in anyway. But I'm fine with anything from November to January, but I do think that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1820)|
| 0:30:29| need to have that. It does bother me doing the evaluation with so many NAs listed in the metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1829)|
| 0:30:40| Mr. Bolton. Thank you, Madam Chair. So I looked at that. I did a little bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| research about the last time that we did a new evaluation model. There was a prior model that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1846)|
| 0:30:53| was approved in 2015, and then on June 13th of 2018, there was a committee that was formed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1853)|
| 0:31:03| take on this evaluation model. They met a total of about six times over a period of about ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1863)|
| 0:31:09| months for that evaluation to be approved. It was approved in April of 2019. Subsequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1869)|
| 0:31:15| it was used two months later to evaluate the superintendent. As I read the board policy in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| terms of the evaluation of the superintendent, the timing of that evaluation, it almost seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1880)|
| 0:31:28| like if that was a matter that the board would want to take on about looking at a new evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| document, I'm thinking best case scenario that document could be used in 2023, maybe in 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1892)|
| 0:31:40| because as I read the evaluation policy, and Mr. Dupler may have to correct me on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1900)|
| 0:31:46| but the way I understand it is the superintendent has to be aware of the expectations in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| document prior to him being evaluated by that document. So I think that the earliest that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1912)|
| 0:31:59| could happen, if we look at what's happened in the past, a committee is formed ten months later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| a new evaluation is adopted, and then that evaluation could be used, but it has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| prior to that particular year. So I just wanted to throw that in if that's the pleasure of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| Thank you, Mr. Bolton. Ms. Babb, and then we'll go to Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| Yeah, and this is my last comment. I just would prefer us to go with the fall. I think once we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| had the data, I mean, my big issue is with lack of data, as several other people have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| So I think the fall, my issue with staying, waiting until January is, I do think it's getting into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| year and a half without an evaluation, and I just feel like that's too long. I mean, I know it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| one-year cycle that it would be a problem. So at least for this next year, I would push for November's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1962)|
| 0:32:49| October, November, as soon as the data is available for us to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| Okay. Thank you, Ms. Babb. Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| Thank you, Madam Chair. I just want to make sure all board members know that when that committee was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1974)|
| 0:33:00| working, there was an effort to not add anything new to that evaluation so that the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1980)|
| 0:33:08| would have plenty of knowledge of what was going to be in it. So that was part of it, so that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| wasn't a completely new evaluation. It was just consolidating the repetitive questions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=1994)|
| 0:33:22| working out some really confusing wording that was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| Yes. Thank you for making that clarification, because that's the case. It was, there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| nothing new added to the evaluation from the previous evaluation, which is why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| and it was used so quickly after. Okay. Mr. Dupler, did you have one more comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2015)|
| 0:33:42| Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair. Just wanted to make one clarification. In the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| this board has treated the evaluation and contract negotiations as at least coinciding. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2027)|
| 0:33:58| we realize they're not the same thing, but that was the whole reason for the language in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2038)|
| 0:34:04| contract itself right now is, in fact, that 45 and 30-day window does deal with, in the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2044)|
| 0:34:12| with contracts, with the contract with the superintendent. You cannot enter into or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2052)|
| 0:34:18| you know, extend the superintendent's contract within that time frame. So that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| just wanted to clarify, I mean, you know, I mean, you all realize it's not the exact same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| but they are intertwined, and that's why it's written that way in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| Thank you, Mr. Dupler. So I would propose that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| do a November evaluation that we, on September 29th at our work session, that Mr. Bolton would come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2078)|
| 0:34:45| go through the evaluation tool with us. We would have the month of October to prepare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2085)|
| 0:34:51| the evaluation and then do a called meeting in November. Is everybody in agreement with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2091)|
| 0:34:58| Okay. All right. Good. I think that's good. And then new board members would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| a couple of months that they would have been here. So hopefully, and as Ms. Christie said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| hopefully they're paying attention already and have some opinions anyway. So we would hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| We would hope so. Good point. So, okay. That's great. Thank you so much, Mr. Bolton. We appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| you leading us through that conversation. Okay. And now I am happy to welcome our Curriculum and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2117)|
| 0:35:25| Instruction Executive Director, Shannon Jackson, and she's going to walk us through academics and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| and bring us up to speed. So thank you so much for being here. You're welcome. Good evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| Madam Chair, members of the board, superintendent. I'm excited to be here today. There has been a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2136)|
| 0:35:42| happening in the last week with legislation and I was asked to address a couple of key aspects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| with that. So this presentation is really going to focus on some of what we're hearing about learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2147)|
| 0:35:53| loss and our recovery plans, how we have been thinking about assessment and using that, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| then getting into some reading instruction. I know there's been some legislation around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| I have the reading department with me with a couple of teachers to talk about our approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| to reading and how the new legislation impacts us. And they will also be able to give you some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| classroom examples. So we have had an ongoing response to COVID-19 since March 13th of last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2171)|
| 0:36:18| year. So that is the day that we were closed for spring break and we started realizing what was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2178)|
| 0:36:25| happening and thinking through what this would mean for students. So when we first closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| my department, we thought we would be reopening. We started working with teachers to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| what part of the content students were missing during that closure so that we could be prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| to help teachers with that when we returned. That's been an ongoing conversation. So what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| we ended up doing with that when we were closed was to really work with our teachers on from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2206)|
| 0:36:53| that March 13th closure until May, what content did we miss in those different grade levels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2213)|
| 0:37:00| And then from that, we started looking into the research. We have never experienced a long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| closure like this before, but there are other school systems that have. So we started going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| into the research and the first place we looked, John Hattie had written about the closure based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2229)|
| 0:37:16| on the Christchurch earthquake in 2011. And so we were able to look at their response to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2236)|
| 0:37:23| that long-term closure and how they measured students who were who remained in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2243)|
| 0:37:30| school district, came back to the school district, and what were successful strategies for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| We also have a closer example with Katrina in New Orleans. That was an August event and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2254)|
| 0:37:41| students were out of school for some of them up to a year. So we were able to look at the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| not the students who left New Orleans and came back, but the students who remained in New Orleans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| and missed the significant portion of the school year. And we started to build our model off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| that. As we started getting into this research, we realized that a lot of the other big districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| were looking at that as well. We connected with several across the country around how they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| thinking about this. A couple of things that I want to make sure people are clear on are two terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| that started to emerge in that research. Remediation, which is where we are identifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| where students are missing content and filling those gaps. We can't live in remediation because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| as you can see the graph there is showing what we call the Matthew effect. If we put students in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| just remediation, it is the red line. They stay in that lower level only getting the remediated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| learning, while their peers who are on grade level are continuing to accelerate and the gap widens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| So we have to work also with acceleration which is where we identify what they need for grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| level content and make sure that we are giving them the point of help at the point of need so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2324)|
| 0:38:51| that they stay on grade level. What we didn't want was to start focusing so much on remediation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| that we had third graders who at the end of third grade were ready to start second half of third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| grade. We wanted third graders who at the end of third grade were ready to start fourth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| So we're remediating the missed content from second grade and giving them all of third grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| so that they're ready for fourth grade. So our model for that started with really focusing on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2350)|
| 0:39:19| strong routines. We know that students who were out of school for a long period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| were losing that sense of routine and losing the connection with the adults in the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| which we thought was the most important thing for us to spend some time early on reconnecting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| establishing routines and reteaching students how to do school. Making sure that our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| had a chance to look at that missed content in the previous grade levels and have some time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| talk to each other about so the second grade teachers had a chance to talk to first grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| teachers and a chance to talk to third grade teachers within their buildings. And we worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| on some pre-assessments so that at the point of new learning the teachers would have a pre-assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| that they could use to identify what skills might be missing so that they could remediate those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| skills and accelerate the learning and keep all students on grade level. So what we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| doing is preparing our students for the future while filling those holes that may have come about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| as a result of the closure. The other thing that we were learning from the research is that when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| students are in school they have exposure to academic vocabulary in all their subjects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2421)|
| 0:40:27| and that academic vocabulary is critical for their learning, their background knowledge, their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| content development and that is why all of our subjects are so important because they all build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| those concepts for our students and so we wanted to put a strong emphasis on that academic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| vocabulary within our schools. So our key to this is in the planning and that we needed to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2443)|
| 0:40:51| with the standards and the content that students missed and the standards and the content| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| they needed to regain. We needed to build routines around looking at our pre-assessment data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2456)|
| 0:41:02| Fortunately we've been a district that has PLC meetings and other collaborative meetings for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2462)|
| 0:41:08| teachers so they're already looking at this data. It's already the way they operate so we were able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| to say you know this is not new it just may look a little different this year and how do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| intentionally work together and have some of those vertical conversations to help to understand what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| might be going on with with some of our students and then looking at those best strategies for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| filling those gaps. So that's where we started looking into the pedagogy and we had to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| a little differently this year because of moving to some virtual platforms. So looking at staying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| with high quality evidence-based instruction and as students are performing on those assessments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2498)|
| 0:41:45| understanding is their performance based on it's a different strategy we're having to use because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| we're virtual and so how do we think about filling and changing that strategy or are we seeing a gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| that that needs to be filled because of missing content. So our teachers have been really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| intentional about about thinking through that and planning and working together. I'll tell you we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| had a professional development session on this on a Friday evening from 3 30 to 5 30 and I had 60| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| teachers who jumped in to think about just that very topic. So they're really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| they're feeling this and they're working hard to make sure their students are ready and then it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2537)|
| 0:42:24| looking at those structures. So what tools do they need, how does the current context allow for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2544)|
| 0:42:30| to deliver that instruction and then what's the most efficient way for them to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| So what you see next is a thank you is a sample of something that our math department put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2556)|
| 0:42:46| We have this for every subject every grade and this is how we started thinking in July and led| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2566)|
| 0:42:54| our August in-service day around these kinds of documents. So when we collected from our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2574)|
| 0:43:01| what content was missed at each grade level we then created a document that we could share vertically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| so that a third grade teacher in math would know that the the last thing that was missed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| in or let me say a fourth grade teacher would know the last thing to be covered in third grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| was lesson 24 and that's what students didn't get. Where should they pick up to cover that material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2598)|
| 0:43:24| and where does it fit within their current set of standards and then what materials are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| to them to cover that material so that the students are able to recover that learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2609)|
| 0:43:36| We covered this as a district and then we asked our teachers in that August in-service day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| to talk within their own schools to see if this was true for them in their school because we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| that they adjust as they need to based on the students they have in front of them. So this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| was a launching point for a conversation and then they had these conversations within their school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| to make their plan. So our recommendations were again to start with those routines and reconnection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2637)|
| 0:44:06| focus on acceleration so that they are ready for that next grade level but remediate when necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| we did recommend that they have three hours a day of reading and writing instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2652)|
| 0:44:18| that they're constantly monitoring learning and that they are prioritizing those grade level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| and higher texts in second grade and up so that they get that academic vocabulary. We also said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| that we really did not want anybody to short shrift the arts, world language, science, library, media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| and social studies because those are really important for building the background knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2674)|
| 0:44:39| and that academic vocabulary and concept that helps them to learn in every subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| So before we move on to the reading part are there any questions around our plan so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2685)|
| 0:44:58| I don't see any questions. Okay so I am excited to present to you our supervisor of K-5 reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2698)|
| 0:45:06| Janet Sexton. She is going to talk to you about evidence-based instruction and classroom examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| specifically in reading. We've seen a lot of legislation going around about reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| We've been addressing some of the questions and so we wanted to give you an overview of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| how Knox County approaches reading and how that fits in with the legislation. So I will turn it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| over to Janet. Thank you Ms. Jackson. Madam Chair, Board Members, Superintendent, there's been a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2724)|
| 0:45:33| of conversation around the Tennessee Literacy Success Act and I've been asked to share how this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2733)|
| 0:45:40| might impact Knox County schools and how we align and I appreciate the opportunity to do so this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| evening. We've all been told or you've read that the intent of this new act is of course to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| the number of students who are proficient in reading. But what does it mean to be a proficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2751)|
| 0:45:58| reader and how will this impact Knox County schools? You know some people never give this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2758)|
| 0:46:05| question a lot of thought. Others like me and probably you have been asked this question more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| time than we could count. I'm going to ask you to think for just a minute about that reader who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2770)|
| 0:46:17| struggling and think about what it might be like to learn to read when it's difficult or it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| happen easily. In fact, reach back even further and think a little bit about your experience in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| learning to read. Most likely our experiences are fairly similar. There are going to be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| variances for a multitude of reasons but it's so easy to say that reading is I recognize the words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2794)|
| 0:46:41| I can decode them, I have language comprehension and I understand it, I get it. But I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| share just a quick video here that talks about the complexity of learning to read by using the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2807)|
| 0:46:55| example of a reading rope and looking at the strands of the reading rope. And as you watch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2815)|
| 0:47:02| this short video, I want you to ask yourself how strong is your reading rope, how do you know and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2822)|
| 0:47:08| would you jump? Imagine you're going bungee jumping. This is your third time so you feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2828)|
| 0:47:18| really good about going up to the highest platform. You get to the top and step up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| the jump line. You take one last look at your bungee cord. That's when you see the portions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| of your cord are frayed. How do you feel about jumping now that you know your rope isn't strong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2848)|
| 0:47:35| We know from the simple view of reading that readers need to be skilled in both word recognition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| and language comprehension and that poor skills in either one creates a breakdown in reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| abilities. To provide effective instruction, it's helpful to understand with a little more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2864)|
| 0:47:50| exactly where the reader needs help. So let's dive deeper into this equation and explore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| Hollis Scarborough's reading rope. The lower strand of the reading rope focuses on word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| recognition and includes three critical skills, phonological awareness, decoding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2882)|
| 0:48:10| and sight recognition. These skills affect how we interact with printed text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2890)|
| 0:48:18| Phonological awareness is our ability to work with speech sounds of language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| like knowing that syllables make up words, hand, dull, or recognizing the individual sounds within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2902)|
| 0:48:29| words. Decoding requires knowledge of the alphabetic principle, which is that sounds are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2909)|
| 0:48:37| represented by letters and that not all spelling sound correspondences are direct one-to-one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| relationships. Like you can spell the sound several different ways. For example, the word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2922)|
| 0:48:48| cake has two spellings for this one sound. Sight recognition means that you see a familiar word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2928)|
| 0:48:55| and can instantly process it. Be aware that this doesn't mean only high-frequency words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2935)|
| 0:49:02| To understand a reader struggling with the word recognition strand of the reading rope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| try reading this out loud. That's pretty hard, right? We've artificially frayed your reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2946)|
| 0:49:13| rope by removing the vowels, simulating a word recognition weakness. You might be able to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| a few words here and there, but you can't decode accurately or efficiently. As these lower strand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| skills become stronger, they also become increasingly automatic. This frees up precious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| processing power for language comprehension, which takes us to the upper strand of the reading rope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| The upper strand includes five key components. Background knowledge, vocabulary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2976)|
| 0:49:44| language structures, verbal reasoning, and literacy knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2984)|
| 0:49:51| Background knowledge. Think of this as all the built-up facts, concepts, and beliefs that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| bring to the table when comprehending or learning from a text or situation. This knowledge acts as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=2996)|
| 0:50:02| a solid base for new learning. Vocabulary. This includes both the breadth and depth of one's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| knowledge of the meaning of words in a text. Does the student understand that revolting can mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| disgusting, as well as rising up in rebellion? Language structures. This is how our language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3014)|
| 0:50:23| is organized. It's the relationships between the words and sentences in a text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| Semantics and syntax play a role in knowing that it's more common to structure a sentence like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| the barn owl hoots at night, than hoot at night the barn owl does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| Verbal reasoning. This is where the rubber hits the road with the ability to make inferences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| and understand metaphors, similes, and idioms. Literacy knowledge. This includes basic print| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3043)|
| 0:50:51| concepts, like we read from left to right and not right to left, as well as how text is organized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3051)|
| 0:50:57| for specific purposes. In the upper strands of the rope, readers become increasingly strategic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3057)|
| 0:51:04| and ultimately skillful over time. Let's look at the example paragraph again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| Both upper and lower strand skills and abilities are necessary to read the words quickly and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| read for meaning. Given that learning to read in alphabetically based orthographies entails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| visual recoding of language in the form of alphabetic characters representing speech sounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| and given that both phonological and visual coding are involved to some extent in language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| acquisition and language processing, we suggest these two abilities are most basic of the various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3090)|
| 0:51:36| cognitive abilities that underlie the ability to learn to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| Putting the vowels back in eliminates the simulated decoding deficit, making word recognition so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| easier. But even knowing the words, you had to really lean on your language comprehension skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| to follow the meaning, right? Skilled readers are strong in both language comprehension ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3113)|
| 0:52:00| and word recognition skills. When both strands are woven tightly together, readers can jump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3120)|
| 0:52:06| into any text with confidence. All right, so how strong is your reading growth and how would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3126)|
| 0:52:18| know? And do you feel like it's strong enough that you could take that leap that we're asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| our students to do? If we take a closer look at this sentence, which by the way is considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| extremely complex, we all can recognize the words, obviously. We can decode them, but is that really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3149)|
| 0:52:37| reading? Not quite because we know there's so much more. We have to engage in language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3157)|
| 0:52:43| comprehension and to be able to understand what we've read. Now, when we read the sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| the lower part of the rope is fairly solid. We know that sounds are represented by letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| so we can make that connection in order to decode. We also probably recognize many of these words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3174)|
| 0:53:01| automatically or by sight. And you're probably familiar with the vocabulary for many of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3181)|
| 0:53:08| But this sentence has 62 words, one sentence. But what about the upper part of the rope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3188)|
| 0:53:17| Do we have the background knowledge, the vocabulary, understand language structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3197)|
| 0:53:23| or syntax or the order of the words? Do we have the verbal reasoning that we could take this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| make inferences or summarize or draw conclusions or retell it to someone else? Or do we have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3208)|
| 0:53:36| literary knowledge to take a complex sentence like this and dissect it so that we could literally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| create a mental map in our mind of what we understand? Well, the two parts of the rope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3222)|
| 0:53:48| are obviously what often separates our struggling readers, those who perhaps might be labeled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3228)|
| 0:53:55| basic or below basic from our proficient or advanced. Now, because of my background in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3235)|
| 0:54:02| reading and this is my life and my work, I can comprehend and understand this and restate and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3242)|
| 0:54:08| summarize. But if this was a legal draft, I'd probably need some help from Mr. Dupler. Or if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3248)|
| 0:54:14| it was research on quantum physics, I would assure you that I would need someone to teach me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| explicitly, build some background, maybe open my understanding of vocabulary. I would need some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3259)|
| 0:54:28| help in literally taking it apart and looking at the clauses and so forth. And this is why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3268)|
| 0:54:34| when we think about reading, it's hard to just say, well, it's just reading words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| and understanding what you say. It's extremely complex. Now, our goal, of course, for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3279)|
| 0:54:45| students is that both the upper and lower strands of the reading rope become proficient and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3285)|
| 0:54:52| solidified. And by the way, the gist of this sentence is what we know, and that's recognizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| the words, you can comprehend the sentence. Or you need both, to be able to recognize the words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| and comprehend the sentence. So the question is, how does the Tennessee Literacy Success Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3304)|
| 0:55:10| define foundational literacy skills? If you're like me, we've heard a lot of buzz and talk and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| lot of things that weren't necessarily accurate. I took this verbatim from the bill. It means to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3316)|
| 0:55:23| be aware of phonemic awareness, which is sound, phonics, which is matching sounds to letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3323)|
| 0:55:29| fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. So it's not just a phonics bill. The bill does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3329)|
| 0:55:36| require that the LEAs provide foundational literacy skills instruction to students in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3336)|
| 0:55:42| kindergarten through third grade. And they do expect that the foundational literacy skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| must be the primary form of instructional programming for English language arts. So how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| does Knox County align with these requirements or expectations? One of the things that I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3353)|
| 0:55:59| to share just briefly before we look at the two side by side, many of you are familiar with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3359)|
| 0:56:05| year-long reading course that has been in play and sort of the anchor foundation for all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| professional development that we've been doing for about seven or eight years. If you look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| center paragraph here that's written in bolded print, it talks about everything in this course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3374)|
| 0:56:22| is anchored in the science of learning. It's devoted to instructional strategies supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3382)|
| 0:56:27| by research like the reading rope that we just saw. And beginning with the challenge of learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| to read we work from developing those foundational skills, decoding, fluency, oral language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3392)|
| 0:56:38| vocabulary, etc. And all professional development is anchored in that. So let's take a look then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3398)|
| 0:56:45| quickly at the expectations of this bill side by side what we do for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3405)|
| 0:56:53| The requirements from the Tennessee Literacy Act obviously reading screener three times a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3413)|

| 1:01:47| read, getting a writing sample, finding out who knows letters, it sounds, etc. This is something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3707)|
| 1:01:53| we've been working with them for many years and they're very capable of doing so. We've also made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| a couple of purchases, an e-pocket chart which is an online platform for teaching foundational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3717)|

| 1:02:20| the reading department, my team of folks, we've all worked to create independent reading tasks that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3740)|

| 1:02:35| the students. So that's just sort of a sneak peek into what we've been doing. So the question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3755)|
| 1:02:43| what does it mean to be a proficient reader or to read at grade level? Well, this slide is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3763)|
| 1:02:49| the mantra of the reading department and I don't think in the last 10 years we've done a professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| development with teachers, coaches, administrators, or anyone without including this slide. In fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| I've said to people the minute we take our eyes off of this slide is the day we need to walk away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3780)|
| 1:03:06| because this is our end goal for all students. And if you think about it, reading with accuracy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3786)|
| 1:03:12| at appropriate rate, which is conversational, reading with expression and prosody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| that is what we see or know as that lower strand of the reading record. But to be able to retell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3797)|
| 1:03:26| the text in your own words, to summarize it, to ask and answer questions, to be able to write| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3806)|

| 1:03:37| to transfer, that's that upper strand of the rope. So you can clearly see in our goal here, our mantra,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3817)|
| 1:03:46| both sides of what needs to be there. So how do we align with the KCS, or excuse me, with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3826)|

| 1:03:58| we have teachers who recognize if there's a breakdown or a fray in a student's rope, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=3838)|

| 1:08:53| I overcome that with, I do not have my kids come to my carpet because of social distancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=4133)|

| 1:09:56| good evening. My name is Nicole Buchanan, and I teach third grade virtually at Fountain City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| Elementary. To say that this has been a challenging year would be an understatement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=4202)|
| 1:10:08| but I have watched my students willingly take on these new challenges and grow significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=4208)|
| 1:10:14| This year, teachers knew that learning loss gaps would most likely be wider due to the extended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=4214)|

| 1:10:26| needs. At the start of the year, I began to determine these student needs using a mix of both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=4226)|
| 1:10:32| formal data from diagnostic testing, such as the AIMSwebPlus universal screener, and informal data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=4232)|
| 1:10:40| as well. Informally, I assessed my students' reading abilities and areas of need by meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=4240)|
| 1:10:47| with them one-on-one through Microsoft Teams and listening to them read aloud to me. This allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=4247)|
| 1:10:53| me to take anecdotal notes on their decoding abilities, accuracy, rate, and prosody, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=4253)|

| 1:11:05| to build small groups in reading. Within these small group meetings in Microsoft Teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=4265)|
| 1:11:12| I'm able to target common reading needs and work to close learning gaps while still exposing all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=4272)|
| 1:11:18| of my students to complex grade-level text. Each day in whole group reading lessons, all students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=4278)|

| 1:11:32| skills. My students continue to read to me individually while I take anecdotal notes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=4292)|
| 1:11:39| give meaningful feedback to them in the moment. Through a platform called Seesaw, they write,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=4299)|

| 1:26:01| proficiency. So even though we're not happy we're like Miss Thuxton said we always want higher but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=5161)|
| 1:26:08| just to just so that everybody understands that and knows that also I think that's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| to point out. Thank you Mr. Watson. I'm not sure who's best best equipped to answer this but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=5172)|

| 1:26:24| but it's so all throughout the legislative session and before there's a lot of emphasis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=5184)|
| 1:26:29| from the state to say this is what we have to do this is going to get us to the proficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| levels that we need right but what I just heard you all articulate very well is that for 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| around 10 years now we've been trying to do those things right and doing those it seems like very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=5198)|

| 1:26:50| question I'm asking it authentically I'm trying to discern what is it that the state is feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=5210)|
| 1:26:56| is magic about this approach when when there's a system like ours and I know others too who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=5216)|
| 1:27:02| doing these things but are not you know that I think the state in some ways like hey we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=5222)|
| 1:27:08| to get 75 if we do this really well but obviously that's not the case so I don't know I guess help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=5228)|

| 1:27:18| discussions with the legislature we've been watching and keeping up with the discussions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=5238)|
| 1:27:23| my understanding is and on this part they're not wrong early intervention is key to getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=5243)|
| 1:27:31| students on grade level if we identify them early and we provide remediation we can we have a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=5251)|
| 1:27:39| chance of getting students to grade level so I think maybe the the intent there is is what they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=5259)|
| 1:27:47| going for but I'm not sure that we have not yet had any guidance from the department on what this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210127b?start=5267)|
