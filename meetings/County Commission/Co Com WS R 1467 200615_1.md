| 2:02:59| It's always a learning experience to be here, Mr. Chairman, and I can wait until next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7379)|
| 2:03:04| You can wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7384)|
| 2:03:05| Especially knowing that next week will be my last time before you, but I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| Okay, well, we'll move that to next week, but that will not be during the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7388)|
| 2:03:12| We'll add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7392)|
| 2:03:13| We'll have the discussion actually during the Board of Commissioners meeting, so you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| want to get here a little bit early if that's all right with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7398)|
| 2:03:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7399)|
| 2:03:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7400)|
| 2:03:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7401)|
| 2:03:22| Do we need a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7402)|
| 2:03:23| Partly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7403)|
| 2:03:24| There's a discussion item, so we can just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7404)|
| 2:03:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7406)|
| 2:03:27| So we can just do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7407)|
| 2:03:28| Move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7408)|
| 2:03:29| The only other item that I'm seeing that we had down here was we were going to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7409)|
| 2:03:33| the 5G stuff that came out of the setting of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7413)|
| 2:03:36| I know that we also said that we'd probably put that to the Cable Committee as an item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7416)|
| 2:03:42| What I'd like to do is I'll probably move that to next week's meeting also as an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7422)|
| 2:03:46| discussion item just to kind of maybe have Commissioner Behler share kind of a schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7426)|
| 2:03:50| on when the Cable Committee meeting can get rolling on this, and we'll look to the Legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7430)|
| 2:03:57| Relations Committee to maybe weigh in on that, too, just so that we can get some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7437)|
| 2:04:02| I'm looking to you, Commissioner Schoenberger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7442)|
| 2:04:03| Well, and also the Senate was wrapping up, the Tennessee Senate was wrapping up today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7443)|
| 2:04:07| their business, and then the Tennessee House is wrapping it up Friday of this week, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7447)|
| 2:04:12| it'll be easier to talk to Representative Zachary and Representative Wright and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7452)|
| 2:04:18| that to follow up, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7458)|
| 2:04:21| We'll have a formal discussion on that added to next week's agenda because we had added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7461)|
| 2:04:26| it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7466)|
| 2:04:27| The hour waxes late, and we'll move that to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7467)|
| 2:04:32| So, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7474)|
| 2:04:35| And I want to say four years ago, this same incident with Verizon came up in the Burlington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7475)|
| 2:04:40| community when I first came on commission, and it was the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7480)|
| 2:04:44| So I will get the city of Knoxville to pull the information from that Verizon right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7484)|
| 2:04:54| that was at the Holston Center that they wanted to put this same tower four years ago that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7494)|
| 2:05:00| I was involved in with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7500)|
| 2:05:02| And it was some of the original language that we need to go back if we're doing a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7502)|
| 2:05:08| that the city has already encountered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7508)|
| 2:05:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7510)|
| 2:05:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7511)|
| 2:05:12| So what I'd like to propose is we do have public forum on the meeting as it relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7512)|
| 2:05:15| to this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7515)|
| 2:05:20| I think, I'm not sure, I know we're going to be having public forum if it's related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7520)|
| 2:05:24| to the budget, at the budget hearing, which we're going to close this meeting and move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7524)|
| 2:05:27| into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7527)|
| 2:05:28| But is there anyone who wants to speak at public forum specific to the work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7528)|
| 2:05:33| agenda or items not necessarily pertaining to the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7533)|
| 2:05:38| I mean, if you're here, come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7538)|
| 2:05:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7541)|
| 2:05:47| Sir, I'm Laura Squires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7547)|
| 2:05:48| I spoke earlier regarding 5G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7548)|
| 2:05:51| I cannot tell you how much I appreciate you adding this to the agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| I cannot tell you how urgently this must be reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7554)|
| 2:05:58| I know that you said, Commissioner Beeler, July 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7558)|
| 2:06:01| By July 22nd, Knox County needs to have a resolution to go alongside Farragut's resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7561)|
| 2:06:06| to go to Governor Bill Lee, to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7566)|
| 2:06:09| I know that he said that we can't do a lot because it's the FCC order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7569)|
| 2:06:13| The FCC order is not our main problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| The state of Tennessee law is our main problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7576)|
| 2:06:18| We need urgent help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7578)|
| 2:06:19| If you all want me to give you a copy, in Thursday's Farragut press, U.S. Cellular announced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7579)|
| 2:06:24| intention to put a 38-foot tower on East Foxton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| It's happening where I live right now, but it is not going to be long until it happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7588)|
| 2:06:32| to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7592)|
| 2:06:33| So I cannot beg you enough to make this an urgent agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| We can't drag our feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7595)|
| 2:06:36| We can't wait 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7596)|
| 2:06:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7598)|
| 2:06:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7599)|
| 2:06:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7600)|
| 2:06:41| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7601)|
| 2:06:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7602)|
| 2:06:43| Please send that information to commission at knoxcounty.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| And then on July the 20th, you know, we'll have public speaking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7608)|
| 2:06:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7613)|
| 2:06:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7614)|
| 2:06:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7615)|
| 2:06:56| What I'm going to propose, that brings us to the end of the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| We do need to take about a 10-minute recess, and then we'll convene the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7619)|
| 2:07:03| So the work session is officially closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200615?start=7623)|
