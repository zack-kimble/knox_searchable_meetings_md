| 0:00:06| But we will call the agenda meeting to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=6)|
| 0:00:11| And I know there are some additions that some would like to make to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=11)|
| 0:00:16| John, are you wanting to make two additions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=16)|
| 0:00:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=18)|
| 0:00:19| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=19)|
| 0:00:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=20)|
| 0:00:23| I'd like to add an item, consideration of a resolution to approve a contract with TMA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=23)|
| 0:00:28| which is Tax Management Associates and the Knox County Property Assessor for the audit of business personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=28)|
| 0:00:37| You're going to give the documentation to Jolie, I assume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=37)|
| 0:00:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=39)|
| 0:00:40| The contract is with the law department right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=40)|
| 0:00:43| So that will be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=43)|
| 0:00:46| Item 28 is listed as an initial resolution for bonds, for the issuance of bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=46)|
| 0:00:52| It really should be split into two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=52)|
| 0:00:55| A consideration of a resolution, an initial resolution, and a consideration of a final resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=55)|
| 0:01:00| So the wording is going to be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=60)|
| 0:01:02| It's for the same item, but it takes two resolutions to accomplish the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=62)|
| 0:01:08| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=68)|
| 0:01:09| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| Mr. Chairman, thank you for recognizing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=72)|
| 0:01:16| We have two we'd like to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=76)|
| 0:01:18| One is a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=78)|
| 0:01:21| It's a resolution that recognizes the donations for a health fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=81)|
| 0:01:25| We're going to have in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=85)|
| 0:01:28| And I have sent the information to Jolie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=88)|
| 0:01:32| And the other one was also something I didn't have on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=92)|
| 0:01:35| It is a contract for the sale of property in the very front of the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=95)|
| 0:01:42| and would allow us to expand our parking lot, parking area, just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=102)|
| 0:01:48| And in that document, the contract, we have an appraisal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| and we have, I think, all the documentation that the commission would need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| And I assume you've worked with finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| Yeah, they're not seeking any additional funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| The funding is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=121)|
| 0:02:03| It's in the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| So we had planned for this some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| It's an elderly gentleman who had designated or stated some time ago they wanted the health department to have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=126)|
| 0:02:14| option to buy this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=134)|

| 0:02:26| approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=146)|

| 0:03:04| personal property contract that with TMA that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| It's in the budget already, but we have it every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=189)|
| 0:03:13| Yeah, that's the same one that I asked for, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| Just the messenger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| Just to get you all together, that departments within the county government talk to one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=200)|
| 0:03:27| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to add a brief discussion item where I could, as Vice Chair of the Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=207)|
| 0:03:34| could report to commission about yesterday's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| There was a couple of things in there I was asked to convey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| Is it already on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| No, that's the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| There are several that have been on there month after month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| That's sort of on a rotator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| There's one about our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| Yeah, I'll bring the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| I think the charter would probably postpone 30 days so it will come back in its corrected form probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=233)|
| 0:04:02| Yeah, because I postponed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| We'll probably postpone that again this time and take it up in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| I think that's appropriate because I think the Audit Committee will consider those changes before it comes back to full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=249)|
| 0:04:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| And then just add a brief discussion item where I can basically apprise commission of the things we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=260)|
| 0:04:27| that I was asked to convey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| Buzz, you got anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| In that event, we will adjourn the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| Thank you all for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090506agendameeting?start=278)|
