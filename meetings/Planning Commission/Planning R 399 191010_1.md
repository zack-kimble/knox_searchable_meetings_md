| 2:47:03| The year is 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10023)|
| 2:47:05| Dr. Lyons is writing in the Knoxville News Sentinel about the ten-year plan to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10025)|
| 2:47:11| As has become clear in recent months, the greatest challenge to the ten-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10031)|
| 2:47:16| to those elected to represent us, and to the community at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10036)|
| 2:47:20| is to find places throughout our community for the residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10040)|
| 2:47:23| Some have suggested concentration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10043)|
| 2:47:26| We believe that is not the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10046)|
| 2:47:29| Neighborhoods in the core of the city, Fourth and Gill, Old North, Mechanicsville, and Park Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10049)|
| 2:47:36| have carried a disproportionate amount of the community burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10056)|
| 2:47:39| through their proximity to the emergency services environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10059)|
| 2:47:43| Homelessness is a community problem that requires a community solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10063)|
| 2:47:48| Whether or not you agree with Dr. Lyons that concentrating poverty in East Knoxville is poor policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10068)|
| 2:47:55| the application before you today is so riddled with errors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10075)|
| 2:47:59| and the process to bring it to your consideration so deliberately shrouded that it must not go unchecked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10079)|
| 2:48:06| The proposal is in violation of the Magnolia Avenue Corridor Plan and the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10086)|
| 2:48:12| The corridor plan states, with the park as a centerpiece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10092)|
| 2:48:16| higher intensity uses should be fostered along East 5th Avenue and Woodbine Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10096)|
| 2:48:21| taking advantage of this recreation asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10101)|
| 2:48:24| The entirety of Caswell Park, except for the locked up softball fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10104)|
| 2:48:29| is overlaid with the MUCC4 designation of the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10109)|
| 2:48:33| If you go to that filter on your map up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10113)|
| 2:48:37| you will see that the same MUCC4 that overlies these three parcels in question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10117)|
| 2:48:42| overlies the Ashley Nicole Dream Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10122)|
| 2:48:45| and I think that we're all in agreement that the Ashley Nicole Dream Park is not meant to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10125)|
| 2:48:53| Even if we were to believe that the planners intended the park itself to be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10133)|
| 2:48:59| rather than be the centerpiece that they stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10139)|
| 2:49:02| MUCC4 would not allow the proposed structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10142)|
| 2:49:06| MUCC4 allows office, medium density residential, and traditional neighborhood residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10146)|
| 2:49:13| The one-year plan clearly defines medium density residential as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10153)|
| 2:49:18| residential development at densities from 6 to 24 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10158)|
| 2:49:24| The proposed Caswell Park development is for 47 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10164)|
| 2:49:29| with an RP3 zoning, neither of which is allowed in medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10169)|
| 2:49:34| I understand that there has been a very last minute retraction of the RP3 request to RP1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10174)|
| 2:49:41| but the issue still stands that the one-year plan does not allow more than 24 dwelling units per acre for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10181)|
| 2:49:50| An amendment to the one-year plan would be required for the proposed rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10190)|
| 2:49:59| Please refer to pages 11 and 18 of the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10199)|
| 2:50:04| This application states the existing land use as vacant rather than public park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10204)|
| 2:50:09| I've watched the tapes of the council meeting where these parcels were purchased to be part of Caswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10209)|
| 2:50:15| I've seen the Caswell Park master plan presented to council that shows them as part of the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10215)|
| 2:50:20| I've read the 2010 open space resolutions that MPC and council voted on to protect parkland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10220)|
| 2:50:26| I've seen the rezoning application that expressly includes them within the boundaries of Caswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10226)|
| 2:50:31| I've seen parks and rec maintain them for years, and I've seen my neighbors use them as parkland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10231)|
| 2:50:37| I have not seen anywhere any evidence for Becky Wade's claim that they are not and never were meant to be part of Caswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10237)|
| 2:50:48| You are well aware that the discussion of protecting Knoxville's parkland was precipitated by a similar proposal to develop a portion of Lakeshore Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10248)|
| 2:50:58| whose 200 acres sit in a very wealthy, historically white-segregated portion of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10258)|
| 2:51:05| What makes Caswell Park no longer subject to this protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10265)|
| 2:51:12| Becky Wade made an appalling point that it is just grass and not park because it is behind the softball fence, which is locked through neighborhood residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10272)|
| 2:51:23| If an argument is to be made that it's not as nice as other city parks, this speaks more to the way that the city maintains its parks in East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10283)|
| 2:51:33| than it does to whether East Knoxville deserves to lose its parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10293)|
| 2:51:37| The resolution states, land within public parks should not be sold, leased, or otherwise utilized for the construction of housing or office or commercial developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10297)|
| 2:51:51| without a formal process and extensive public review and input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10311)|
| 2:51:56| Was it a formal process when a city employee earlier this year snuck this same zoning change that you are now tasked with reviewing into the final draft map of recode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10316)|
| 2:52:12| This was an attempt to remove all public review and input from this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10332)|
| 2:52:21| Instead of extensive public review and input, there was one public meeting announced with one week's notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10341)|
| 2:52:29| The city declined the Park Ridge Community Organization's request for help in notifying the public via a mail alert given that there was very short notice of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10349)|
| 2:52:43| PCO spent $550 of donated stamps to let the neighborhood know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10363)|
| 2:52:50| This standing room only meeting overflowed the meeting space, leaving many unable to hear or participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10370)|
| 2:52:58| Despite resounding feedback from the community asking for a delay in what they see as a rushed process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10378)|
| 2:53:06| Dr. Lyons stated he did not consider their input to be reason for considering a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10386)|
| 2:53:15| The conversation on whether it is okay to rezone parkland, especially parkland in a majority-minority neighborhood, needs to be held citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10395)|
| 2:53:26| The process to bring this application before you should be sufficient to shake your faith in its validity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10406)|
| 2:53:33| This application must be rejected because it violates the one-year plan and the city's open space resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10413)|
| 2:53:43| If building permanent supportive housing is your goal, working towards a fair and open process to achieve that would be an admirable effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10423)|
| 2:53:54| Supporting a framework that says we have to accept some deception and inequity in order to have permanent supportive housing is directly counter to your goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10434)|
| 2:54:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10449)|
| 2:54:11| Thank you, Ms. Moyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10451)|
| 2:54:19| Any other comments from the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10459)|
| 2:54:22| Mr. Lyons, one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10462)|
| 2:54:26| Please state your name and your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10466)|
| 2:54:28| Please, you have two minutes and 42 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10468)|
| 2:54:31| Sure, thanks for that extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10471)|
| 2:54:33| My name is Tanner Jessel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10473)|
| 2:54:34| I live at 1026 Wall Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10474)|
| 2:54:36| I did not prepare a statement because I thought we only had five minutes to speak, so we fit what we could in the five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10476)|
| 2:54:42| I will say, like you, I have served at the request of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10482)|
| 2:54:46| I served on the City Greenways Commission for two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10486)|
| 2:54:49| And my time on the Greenways Commission predates the current Parks and Recreation Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10489)|
| 2:54:54| It also predates the current Parks Coordinator, Tim Hester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10494)|
| 2:54:58| So I've studied greenways a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10498)|
| 2:55:00| I was part of the process where we actually came up with the comprehensive greenway plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10500)|
| 2:55:05| And I'll tell you something about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10505)|
| 2:55:07| That parcel, going back to 1998, the Caswell Park study done by the MPC, they said, hey, we should put a greenway linkage between Caswell Park and Park Ridge Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10507)|
| 2:55:18| So putting in this development precludes the opportunity to have that greenway plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10518)|
| 2:55:23| The mayor's own First Creek example said they would put a greenway plan through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10523)|
| 2:55:28| And, Director Green, I asked you a question that there is a standard of minimum parkland, a national standard of minimum parkland per residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10528)|
| 2:55:36| And that question hasn't been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10536)|
| 2:55:38| Is the minimum standard of residential parkland being met if we're taking away parkland in a lower income neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10538)|
| 2:55:46| So when I hear that this isn't used as a park, it never was meant to be developed as a park, that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10546)|
| 2:55:52| Because we have plans that say that there should be, going back to the MPC's own studies in 1998,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10552)|
| 2:55:58| saying there should be a greenway linkage through this open space linking Caswell Park to Park Ridge Park, the little neighborhood park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10558)|
| 2:56:05| Thank you for your service, and thank you for considering our opposition today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10565)|
| 2:56:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10568)|
| 2:56:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10569)|
| 2:56:13| Scott Rupp, 1805 Jefferson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10573)|
| 2:56:16| I'd just like to state we urge you to just delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10576)|
| 2:56:20| We would ask you to just delay your decision on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10580)|
| 2:56:23| There's no reason to approve or reject this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10583)|
| 2:56:27| There is a lot of work that can be done to help everybody and get everybody on board with this moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10587)|
| 2:56:36| This is not in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10596)|
| 2:56:38| This is not a not in my backyard issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10598)|
| 2:56:40| We are not against supportive housing for the homeless by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10600)|
| 2:56:45| We just think that what is proposed here and in that space are too many people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10605)|
| 2:56:51| and we think that there's better solutions for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10611)|
| 2:56:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10614)|
| 2:56:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10615)|
| 2:56:56| Mr. Lyons, would you like to debut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10616)|
| 2:57:00| You have about 30 seconds, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10620)|
| 2:57:03| A minute and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10623)|
| 2:57:04| A minute and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10624)|
| 2:57:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10626)|
| 2:57:08| I'd like to address a few issues that were raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10628)|
| 2:57:11| First, I mean, we can quarrel about whether or not this is or is not part of Caswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10631)|
| 2:57:17| The city has never had it programmed or considered or portrayed or on its city map as part of Caswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10637)|
| 2:57:25| These lots were, in fact, as was pointed out by Mr. Moyer, purchased with the intent of providing the outfield fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10645)|
| 2:57:34| and the drainage necessary for Caswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10654)|
| 2:57:37| But they, in fact, were a rezoned open space following the council designation of that for all vacant land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10657)|
| 2:57:47| and that's how that OS2 got applied there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10667)|
| 2:57:50| Second, we feel the process was perfectly adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10670)|
| 2:57:54| The neighborhood, the main neighborhood, and the neighborhood represented here today was contacted in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10674)|
| 2:58:00| and Mr. Spangler did offer to meet with the board and with the entirety of the community, if they so wished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10680)|
| 2:58:09| And there was a meeting, I believe, with the board in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10689)|
| 2:58:12| and we assume that board members and the leadership did inform all of their members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10692)|
| 2:58:17| just as they did about the public meeting in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10697)|
| 2:58:20| So this is a very important decision that we think pits two interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10700)|
| 2:58:26| In this case, the open space, we think not part of the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10706)|
| 2:58:30| versus the need to comply with the one-year plan and comply as we've amended our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10710)|
| 2:58:37| It does comply with the one-year plan and the sector plan, both the 2003 and 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10717)|
| 2:58:43| both of whom were vetted through a thorough public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10723)|
| 2:58:46| So we're requesting that you vote in affirmative to keep this use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10726)|
| 2:58:52| which is consistent with the long-range zoning plans of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10732)|
| 2:58:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10736)|
| 2:58:57| Thank you, Mr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10737)|
| 2:58:59| I'm going to recognize Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10739)|
| 2:59:01| I see his light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10741)|
| 2:59:04| Hi. I'd like to use our other 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10744)|
| 2:59:06| Yeah, I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10746)|
| 2:59:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10747)|
| 2:59:08| Go ahead. Give me your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10748)|
| 2:59:10| My name is Lynn Rondasso, 1800 Jefferson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10750)|
| 2:59:14| I'm the president of the Park Ridge Community Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10754)|
| 2:59:17| We were contacted by Bruce Spangler in March, April, met with him in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10757)|
| 2:59:23| and then we informed our community what was going on in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10763)|
| 2:59:27| That same month, at a city council meeting, these changes were removed from the recode plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10767)|
| 2:59:34| In June, I followed up with Mayor O'Hara and asked, what are the plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10774)|
| 2:59:39| I did not hear back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10779)|
| 2:59:41| I followed up a week later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10781)|
| 2:59:42| I did not hear back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10782)|
| 2:59:44| I followed up in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10784)|
| 2:59:46| I did not hear back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10786)|
| 2:59:48| So at that time, I contacted Becky Wade, who I did not hear back from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10788)|
| 2:59:52| but a week later finally did hear from Mayor O'Hara on September 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10792)|
| 2:59:57| This did not give us time to give our community notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10797)|
| 3:00:01| And why would we give them notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10801)|
| 3:00:03| As far as we understood, nothing was moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10803)|
| 3:00:06| Just wanted to correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10806)|
| 3:00:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10808)|
| 3:00:09| Thank you for your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10809)|
| 3:00:11| Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10811)|
| 3:00:14| Thank you, Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10814)|
| 3:00:16| Boy, these are never, never easy decisions for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10816)|
| 3:00:20| I realize we have an opportunity to be very popular or very unpopular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10820)|
| 3:00:25| but please respect the fact that we take these cases very seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10825)|
| 3:00:31| and we basically make our decisions on the information before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10831)|
| 3:00:36| I have looked at this quite diligently, and it appears to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10836)|
| 3:00:43| and quite frankly, I would not have supported RP3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10843)|
| 3:00:46| because I don't think we have the authority to support RP3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10846)|
| 3:00:49| However, I don't see anywhere that RP1 is inconsistent with our one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10849)|
| 3:00:57| or our general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10857)|
| 3:00:59| And for that reason, I would make a motion that we approve RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10859)|
| 3:01:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10864)|
| 3:01:08| Chair recognizes Commissioner Canty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10868)|
| 3:01:11| Yes, I heard the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10871)|
| 3:01:13| But, again, to Bill, I was going to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10873)|
| 3:01:17| most of these people want a postponement for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10877)|
| 3:01:22| Are you, I guess, is the, I know you want it to be done by a certain date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10882)|
| 3:01:30| so what's the date again and what's the, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10890)|
| 3:01:34| is there any huge opposition from the city to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10894)|
| 3:01:38| allow a postponement for more conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10898)|
| 3:01:42| Thank you, Commissioner Canty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10902)|
| 3:01:44| The date for the necessity of the VMCs having clear control of the land is January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10904)|
| 3:01:53| And for that, this needing two council votes, if this is delayed today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10913)|
| 3:01:59| we won't be able to meet that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10919)|
| 3:02:01| That's why we would strongly request that there is not the delay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10921)|
| 3:02:06| that all the information needed is before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10926)|
| 3:02:09| and has been publicly available as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10929)|
| 3:02:13| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10933)|
| 3:02:17| I second Commissioner Hill's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10937)|
| 3:02:21| And, again, to reiterate, this is, it's not an easy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10941)|
| 3:02:25| I don't, I drove by the piece of property three times last week looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10945)|
| 3:02:32| I played football at Evan Collins Fields all my adult life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10952)|
| 3:02:39| I probably couldn't have supported RP3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10959)|
| 3:02:41| but RP1 is well within the limits of what it's supposed to be based on the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10961)|
| 3:02:47| that have been set out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10967)|
| 3:02:50| I think we've been really blessed with a city and a county leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10970)|
| 3:02:58| that recognize the need for open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10978)|
| 3:03:01| and recognize the needs for parks and recreations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10981)|
| 3:03:06| I think that we're getting close to having too much that we can't maintain it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10986)|
| 3:03:14| And maintaining those fields and maintaining the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10994)|
| 3:03:17| is a huge expense for the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=10997)|
| 3:03:20| And we're getting to the point where the legacy costs of keeping those up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11000)|
| 3:03:25| I mean, there's nothing better than a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11005)|
| 3:03:27| and nothing worse than a deserted park full of trash and unkept playground equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11007)|
| 3:03:33| So those things have to be considered as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11013)|
| 3:03:36| They're expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11016)|
| 3:03:39| I think that the Park Ridge community is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11019)|
| 3:03:42| based on the list of parks that I've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11022)|
| 3:03:46| I think is well served with parks and open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11026)|
| 3:03:50| Some places in Knoxville and Knox County have more open space and more park space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11030)|
| 3:03:58| but I think Castle Park was a huge positive addition to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11038)|
| 3:04:03| And I live close to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11043)|
| 3:04:04| I live in North Hills, so I'm close to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11044)|
| 3:04:11| I think Park Ridge bears a lot of the responsibility for our underserved population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11051)|
| 3:04:19| I think they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11059)|
| 3:04:20| But also the people in Park Ridge are some of the most acutely aware of people that need housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11060)|
| 3:04:29| They're some of the most generous people and genuine people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11069)|
| 3:04:32| The people in Park Ridge, we did, I think we tried to do a historic overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11072)|
| 3:04:37| and everybody was like, no, we want an interdispersed community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11077)|
| 3:04:40| If you do an overlay, people won't be able to afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11080)|
| 3:04:43| I'm not sure that that was right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11083)|
| 3:04:45| but I heard a huge outcry from the people of Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11085)|
| 3:04:49| So I think you bear your share and then some of our problem with homelessness and underserved people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11089)|
| 3:04:57| But if it continues to be a problem, your neighborhood will probably be the one most impacted as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11097)|
| 3:05:04| I think we ought to push it out to other places as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11104)|
| 3:05:09| Nine years ago, there was a case that came before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11109)|
| 3:05:13| It was an old school in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11113)|
| 3:05:15| And I voted against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11115)|
| 3:05:17| I listened to the, back when we could go and talk to neighbors and neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11117)|
| 3:05:20| without being conflicted with our job, I talked to several of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11120)|
| 3:05:25| And they convinced me that it wasn't a good thing to have homeless people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11125)|
| 3:05:29| and this alternate housing in that building in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11129)|
| 3:05:33| And I voted against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11133)|
| 3:05:34| It got passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11134)|
| 3:05:36| City Council passed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11136)|
| 3:05:39| And I was invited to the finished product from, I think it's Legacy Foundation, one of the foundations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11139)|
| 3:05:46| And it's a huge success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11146)|
| 3:05:49| It took a building that was so blighted that it should have been torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11149)|
| 3:05:55| They took it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11155)|
| 3:05:56| They renovated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11156)|
| 3:05:57| The neighborhood has meeting space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11157)|
| 3:05:59| They have the people there are actually getting a second chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11159)|
| 3:06:04| And their success rate in Flinnegan is unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11164)|
| 3:06:09| So it's not a negative thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11169)|
| 3:06:11| I don't think you're losing a lot of park space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11171)|
| 3:06:14| I think Castle Park is a beautiful facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11174)|
| 3:06:18| My son plays softball there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11178)|
| 3:06:21| I think we're in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11181)|
| 3:06:24| And I hate to go against the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11184)|
| 3:06:26| I know the people in Park Ridge are passionate about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11186)|
| 3:06:30| We do have to look at what's best for everybody and how that all pans out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11190)|
| 3:06:35| And that's all I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11195)|
| 3:06:37| Chair recognizes Commissioner Boston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11197)|
| 3:06:40| Thank you, Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11200)|
| 3:06:41| First of all, I just want to say a big thank you to all of you that have come, probably missed work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11201)|
| 3:06:47| and you've come here to support your neighborhood and support this issue and speak out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11207)|
| 3:06:53| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11213)|
| 3:06:56| Like the other two commissioners, I honestly didn't sleep much last night because of this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11216)|
| 3:07:02| because I know it is so important to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11222)|
| 3:07:05| However, I am happy that it's going to go to RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11225)|
| 3:07:14| I was struggling a little bit with the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11234)|
| 3:07:18| I do have a question for Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11238)|
| 3:07:23| In relation to this neighborhood and surrounding neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11243)|
| 3:07:27| I know this is probably, you know, you might not have that information right at your fingertips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11247)|
| 3:07:33| but could you kind of tell us how many parks there are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11253)|
| 3:07:39| or at least give us some sort of idea, the amount of parks that is already supporting this neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11259)|
| 3:07:47| I'm going to ask Ms. Albertson to maybe, or whoever is in control of the computer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11267)|
| 3:07:52| to pull out on Mr. Reynolds, now, whoever, Ms. Portia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11272)|
| 3:07:57| Taryn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11277)|
| 3:07:58| Taryn, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11278)|
| 3:07:59| We passed this around to zoom out and show the existing land uses so that you can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11279)|
| 3:08:06| I don't have the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11286)|
| 3:08:09| Early in my career, I did some recreation parks planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11289)|
| 3:08:12| and knew the ratio of so many acres of park land to population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11292)|
| 3:08:17| I don't know that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11297)|
| 3:08:18| I do know that there was a survey done by a national organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11298)|
| 3:08:22| I don't think it was National Recreation Parks Administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11302)|
| 3:08:25| that I received that showed the well-served and the level of service of provision of parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11305)|
| 3:08:31| and open space by neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11311)|
| 3:08:34| East Knoxville was well-served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11314)|
| 3:08:36| What struck me was East Knoxville was well-served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11316)|
| 3:08:39| West Knoxville was well-served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11319)|
| 3:08:41| South Knoxville was medium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11321)|
| 3:08:43| North Knoxville, north of North Hills, was underserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11323)|
| 3:08:47| The most underserved portion of the city in terms of having parks and open space is North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11327)|
| 3:08:54| So you're saying this area is well-served?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11334)|
| 3:08:56| Well-served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11336)|
| 3:08:57| If you look at the map up there now, the green shows parks and open space in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11337)|
| 3:09:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11343)|
| 3:09:04| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11344)|
| 3:09:05| I do have a more direct answer than Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11345)|
| 3:09:08| We actually have everything on the north side of Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11348)|
| 3:09:12| Could you state your name, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11352)|
| 3:09:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11353)|
| 3:09:14| I'm James Waldrop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11354)|
| 3:09:15| Just real quick because we've already gone beyond the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11355)|
| 3:09:17| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11357)|
| 3:09:18| I just want to point out that we've already calculated that in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11358)|
| 3:09:21| and we have approximately six usable acres that you don't have to cross Magnolia to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11361)|
| 3:09:26| And your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11366)|
| 3:09:28| James Waldrop, 1710 East 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11368)|
| 3:09:30| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11370)|
| 3:09:32| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11372)|
| 3:09:34| I think this is a tough decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11374)|
| 3:09:36| I think we need both homeless housing is so important, but open parks are important, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11376)|
| 3:09:41| And I just wanted to add that I think it's important for us to have unprogrammed parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11381)|
| 3:09:45| and parks that aren't fenced and that aren't ball fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11385)|
| 3:09:48| And so that's why I hate to see the loss of this particular park because it is just accessible all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11388)|
| 3:09:57| But I understand at the same time the need for the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11397)|
| 3:10:01| Commissioner Cantor, do you have any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11401)|
| 3:10:03| Your light is on, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11403)|
| 3:10:04| Yes, just one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11404)|
| 3:10:07| So this is probably for Bill again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11407)|
| 3:10:12| I get the importance of the area given that it's within the bus line and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11412)|
| 3:10:19| Has there been any other areas considered for this or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11419)|
| 3:10:27| I'm trying to see if there's – I get what people are saying, you know, widened area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11427)|
| 3:10:32| but also it's so close to so many resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11432)|
| 3:10:36| So I'm just trying to get, well, one widened area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11436)|
| 3:10:40| And has there been any other areas considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11440)|
| 3:10:44| Well, the way this entire program works, you can think of both Flanagan and Villa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11444)|
| 3:10:49| is we are approached by folks like VMC with the capacity to put together a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11449)|
| 3:10:54| And they saw this as very suitable land for their proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11454)|
| 3:10:59| So at the meeting that our folks here were in attendance that we had a number of weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11459)|
| 3:11:06| a number of places, one in Caswell Park at what's now the lay-down yard was suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11466)|
| 3:11:11| another at what's in the 500-year flood plain, which is now occupied by the pension office, brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11471)|
| 3:11:17| We did take a look at those, and those could never surpass the bar that's set by the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11477)|
| 3:11:23| for both noise, distance from railroad tracks, flood plain, and others, and distance from public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11483)|
| 3:11:29| But this land is very suitable partially because the city does own it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11489)|
| 3:11:35| which means the cost is negligible, which means the project is actually possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11495)|
| 3:11:39| It's still a very expensive project to conduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11499)|
| 3:11:42| So this isn't something that the city goes looking for a place and then puts out an RFP for a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11502)|
| 3:11:50| That is never how this process has worked or could work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11510)|
| 3:11:53| It is when we respond to those in the community who provide this sort of permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11513)|
| 3:11:57| whose function it is, and we very much appreciate Bruce Spangler and people at VMC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11517)|
| 3:12:02| and others who have taken on these projects to identify a site that they know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11522)|
| 3:12:06| in conjunction with the community development department, will meet the criteria needed for the federal funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11526)|
| 3:12:13| the low-income tax credits, and other things that are essential for making it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11533)|
| 3:12:18| So that's why this location is being at the heart of this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11538)|
| 3:12:24| because the request from the developer is a place they can actually make the project work, and there are very few of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11544)|
| 3:12:30| The other two, as mentioned, one is near Fifth Avenue, that's Menville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11550)|
| 3:12:35| and the other is Flanagan, both of which came to us in similar ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11555)|
| 3:12:41| and were difficult siting decisions as well for many of the concerns that are expressed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11561)|
| 3:12:47| Thank you, Mr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11567)|
| 3:12:49| Commissioner Hill, I would ask that we modify your motion to include the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11569)|
| 3:12:57| This is RP1, and we need to put a maximum density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11577)|
| 3:13:01| I would make a motion for RP1 up to 24 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11581)|
| 3:13:09| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11589)|
| 3:13:12| Any other comments for the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11592)|
| 3:13:15| The motion on the floor is by Commissioner Hill, seconded by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11595)|
| 3:13:20| to approve RP1 to a density of not to exceed 24 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11600)|
| 3:13:27| For the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11607)|
| 3:13:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11609)|
| 3:13:30| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11610)|
| 3:13:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11611)|
| 3:13:32| Motion carries with one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11612)|
| 3:13:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11614)|
| 3:13:40| Next item is number 38, subdivision report concept use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11620)|
| 3:13:46| The subdivision is Dorchester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11626)|
| 3:13:49| The applicant developer is Masada Investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11629)|
| 3:13:55| I'm going to wait until everybody clears out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11635)|
| 3:14:25| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11665)|
| 3:14:26| All day on his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11666)|
| 3:14:29| He's on a whole day on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11669)|
| 3:14:31| I didn't tell Mr. O'Sullivan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11671)|
| 3:14:33| He's not over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11673)|
| 3:14:36| That's why I had him out of his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11676)|
| 3:14:40| There's something about security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11680)|
| 3:14:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11685)|
| 3:14:46| Again, this is item number 38, and the subdivision is Dorchester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11686)|
| 3:14:50| The applicant is Masada Investments, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11690)|
| 3:14:54| Located on the west side of Carpenter Road, northwest of Patriot Way, north of West Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11694)|
| 3:15:01| Approximate acreage is 19.46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11701)|
| 3:15:05| Zoning is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11705)|
| 3:15:08| Existing land use is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11708)|
| 3:15:10| Proposed use, detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11710)|
| 3:15:14| Number of lots is 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11714)|
| 3:15:16| There are four variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11716)|
| 3:15:23| Staff recommendation, and there's two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11723)|
| 3:15:25| Approve variances one through four because the existing access strip and site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11725)|
| 3:15:34| and the proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11734)|
| 3:15:38| The other motion is to approve the concept plan subject to 11 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11738)|
| 3:15:43| Mr. Bretschke, would you like to make a comment on this question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11743)|
| 3:15:50| Just briefly, this staff recommendation has not changed since last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11750)|
| 3:15:55| This was postponed at the request of the adjoining neighborhoods, given an opportunity for them to meet with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11755)|
| 3:16:02| My understanding is they have had a meeting, and you have actually a report in the blue sheets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11762)|
| 3:16:08| a summary from the neighborhood, from Alicia's Vineyard, to that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11768)|
| 3:16:16| Staff, again, recommendation is unchanged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11776)|
| 3:16:20| Thank you, Mr. Bretschke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11780)|
| 3:16:21| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11781)|
| 3:16:23| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11783)|
| 3:16:25| Applicant, would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11785)|
| 3:16:27| Would you like the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11787)|
| 3:16:28| Opposition, you have five minutes to speak, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11788)|
| 3:16:31| If there's someone else interested in speaking, please put the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11791)|
| 3:16:34| You said five minutes, but there's another group here that has nothing to do with the Carpenter Road residents' concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11794)|
| 3:16:41| and it's the Alicia Vineyard's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11801)|
| 3:16:43| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11803)|
| 3:16:44| I have four minutes, 15 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11804)|
| 3:16:46| He has about two and a half minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11806)|
| 3:16:50| Unless the commission wants to extend the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11810)|
| 3:16:52| Can we please extend the two minutes, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11812)|
| 3:16:55| There's a total of seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11815)|
| 3:16:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11816)|
| 3:16:57| There's a total of seven minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11817)|
| 3:16:58| Please kind of split it between the two of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11818)|
| 3:17:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11820)|
| 3:17:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11821)|
| 3:17:02| I'm Jenny Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11822)|
| 3:17:03| I live at 7700 Carpenter Road, and I am representing the majority of residents that live on Carpenter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11823)|
| 3:17:10| As such, we are seriously concerned about Knox County's willingness to grant the variances and the waivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11830)|
| 3:17:17| which, in our opinion, will further create unsafe conditions on a rural road with already existing safety issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11837)|
| 3:17:24| specifically reducing the corner radius for the right-of-way at the intersection of Carpenter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11844)|
| 3:17:30| and the proposed subdivision entrance and exit from the required 25 feet to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11850)|
| 3:17:37| The corner radii directly impact vehicles turning into and out of the proposed subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11857)|
| 3:17:44| And also the second one is horizontal curve centerline radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11864)|
| 3:17:48| They're recommending variances or waivers in variances in three places on the road, one by 40 percent and two by 30 percent each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11868)|
| 3:17:58| Now, this is when you have a transition in roads that allows a vehicle to negotiate a turn at a gradual rate rather than a sharp cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11878)|
| 3:18:08| And also some waivers as requiring that the entrance-exit road into the subdivision be reduced from 26 feet to 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11888)|
| 3:18:17| and also the street pavement for the width of the street pavement for the internal subdivision road from the required 26 feet to 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11897)|
| 3:18:26| All of these deviations from statute together create tighter and tighter vehicle movement into and out of the proposed subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11906)|
| 3:18:34| and along Carpenter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11914)|
| 3:18:36| Cars can squeeze by each other, but your safety margin for error is significantly reduced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11916)|
| 3:18:42| especially when you take into account the pedestrians who actually use Carpenter Road for health and fitness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11922)|
| 3:18:48| as well as any pedestrians from the proposed subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11928)|
| 3:18:53| The reduction of the road width in coordination with the reduced curve radii results in residents in the proposed subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11933)|
| 3:19:01| living and traveling roads made more hazardous by these variances and waivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11941)|
| 3:19:06| None of the statutes for safe road travel seem to matter when it comes to ensuring that a subdivision development goes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11946)|
| 3:19:14| Development seems to be at the expense of safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11954)|
| 3:19:18| Accident data from the Tennessee Highway Safety Office shows that this year we've had eight vehicle accidents on Carpenter Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11958)|
| 3:19:26| and at the intersection of Yont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11966)|
| 3:19:29| We know that several single vehicle accidents weren't reported and are not included in the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11969)|
| 3:19:35| There was one reported accident on Carpenter in 2018 and one in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11975)|
| 3:19:42| The 2019 increase indicates that our concerns about the conditions on the road are valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11982)|
| 3:19:49| Traffic has increased in the surrounding area due to the number of subdivisions that have been developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11989)|
| 3:19:55| over the past five to seven years around Carpenter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11995)|
| 3:19:59| A Knox County traffic count on Carpenter in 2017 resulted in an average of 830 vehicle trips in a 24-hour period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=11999)|
| 3:20:09| When you add the 749 additional vehicle trips from the proposed subdivision, the total reaches 1,579, which is almost double.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12009)|
| 3:20:20| A road similar to length in Carpenter is Yont, which intersects at the north end of Carpenter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12020)|
| 3:20:26| Forty percent of the traffic accidents on Yont Road over the past four years have been at the entrance and exit of subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12026)|
| 3:20:34| The statistics will not get better on Carpenter when Knox County keeps granting variances and waivers for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12034)|
| 3:20:41| I have always viewed Knox MPC as basically a caretaker of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12041)|
| 3:20:46| However, by your process of granting waivers and variances, safety is reduced in our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12046)|
| 3:20:52| Traffic safety will further be compromised if you waive any of the 11 conditions recommended by your staff for this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12052)|
| 3:21:02| because the conditions seem to be intended to help offset the variances and the waivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12062)|
| 3:21:08| Specifically, the requirement...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12068)|
| 3:21:12| Yes, if you're going to split the time, you're past 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12072)|
| 3:21:18| Before this gentleman speaks, if I could, the variances that are identified are those over which this commission has the authority to approve or deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12078)|
| 3:21:28| The waivers are granted by the Knox County Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12088)|
| 3:21:32| So a waiver, and this is for Ms. Mullins also, waivers, this commission has no authority over, only the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12092)|
| 3:21:41| You make the variance knowing they've made these waivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12101)|
| 3:21:46| So they go together in safety on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12106)|
| 3:21:50| Before we hear the next comment, I want to point out that I failed to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12110)|
| 3:21:55| There are three motions on this particular item, and the third is to approve the development plan for up to 70 detached dwellings on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12115)|
| 3:22:04| and the requested reduction of the peripheral setback to 20 feet as identified on the concept plan subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12124)|
| 3:22:11| So I just want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12131)|
| 3:22:13| Go ahead, sir, and give me your name and your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12133)|
| 3:22:17| John Jahowski.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12137)|
| 3:22:18| I'm from 7545 Napa Valley Way, which is one of the roads on the north perimeter of the Alicia Vineyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12138)|
| 3:22:27| So I'll be directly impacted by the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12147)|
| 3:22:31| I have had some conversations with or at least messages with Scott Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12151)|
| 3:22:41| and he's been very forthwith and very helpful in addressing our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12161)|
| 3:22:47| We have not come to an agreement yet, but I think we've gotten the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12167)|
| 3:22:53| We sent out a flyer to all of our residents and got 58 of nearly 70 of our residents to reply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12173)|
| 3:23:02| all of them which indicated we needed to have a barrier on our north perimeter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12182)|
| 3:23:09| There is a history here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12189)|
| 3:23:12| Our construction developer and Scott Davis's company had another subdivision on the east northeast side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12192)|
| 3:23:24| During the period of construction, there was some transfer of people and materials between the two where things were stolen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12204)|
| 3:23:33| and so they erected a fence and that controlled that at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12213)|
| 3:23:38| That fence did not extend to the north because we were told at the time that was not going to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12218)|
| 3:23:44| I think there's a statement in your premises that say that this would not adversely affect the value of the properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12224)|
| 3:23:55| and I object to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12235)|
| 3:23:57| I think our properties will be devalued if these were constructed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12237)|
| 3:24:02| especially if the setback was reduced to 20 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12242)|
| 3:24:05| because there is a steep slope behind the houses on Napa Valley Way that lead up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12245)|
| 3:24:12| So at 20 feet, those houses will be built right at the edge of that slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12252)|
| 3:24:19| and if they put a deck on it, they would actually extend into the slope above those houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12259)|
| 3:24:25| So even if we constructed a fence, it would have to be abnormally high in order to actually be effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12265)|
| 3:24:32| as far as for site and privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12272)|
| 3:24:37| The homes in Alicia Vineyard are end homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12277)|
| 3:24:40| These are where people have worked their entire lives, have built their families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12280)|
| 3:24:47| and have moved there looking to have a safe and settled place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12287)|
| 3:24:53| They've invested their savings into these houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12293)|
| 3:24:56| and I think putting much lower valued homes adjacent to us is going to adversely affect our values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12296)|
| 3:25:08| And we were, again, I do think that Mr. Davis and Mr. Disney have replied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12308)|
| 3:25:17| but they gave us a reply yesterday, which gave us no time to actually look at that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12317)|
| 3:25:23| So we're asking for an additional 30-day extension so that we can continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12323)|
| 3:25:30| and hopefully come to a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12330)|
| 3:25:32| We would like to see the neighborhoods coexist if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12332)|
| 3:25:37| Thank you, Mr. Donosky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12337)|
| 3:25:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12338)|
| 3:25:39| Applicant, you have seven minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12339)|
| 3:25:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12344)|
| 3:25:45| Drew Statton, Masana Investments, PO Box 11315, Knoxville, Tennessee 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12345)|
| 3:25:52| Again, we want to thank the opposition for their willingness and cooperativeness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12352)|
| 3:25:55| in helping kind of try to come to a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12355)|
| 3:25:58| I know sometimes that can be hard to come by, so we do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12358)|
| 3:26:02| And I'll try to address the opposition points the best I can here, so bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12362)|
| 3:26:06| As far as the Carpenter Road residence, we've agreed to the requested improvements on Carpenter Road itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12366)|
| 3:26:14| and we also did get our site surveyor out to confirm that we will be able to achieve the adequate site distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12374)|
| 3:26:21| and so we believe those two can go hand-in-hand with mitigating the traffic and risk concerns there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12381)|
| 3:26:28| And then kind of switching over, again, Mr. Davis did meet with the homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12388)|
| 3:26:33| and was very pleased with the meeting, and he also spoke with Mr. Disney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12393)|
| 3:26:37| who is the developer of Alicia's Vineyard directly south of this property, as they mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12397)|
| 3:26:43| are very agreeable to putting up a barrier, especially a fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12403)|
| 3:26:46| because that was the consensus of the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12406)|
| 3:26:50| And they, again, like he said, Mr. Davis replied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12410)|
| 3:26:53| and so we can come to a solution, I guess, farther outside of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12413)|
| 3:26:59| Another small tidbit I'd like to mention regarding the 20-foot setback, peripheral setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12419)|
| 3:27:07| Alicia's Vineyard is a 15-foot setback, and those are attached homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12427)|
| 3:27:12| and so we are seeking 20-foot, so 5-foot longer or more for single-family detached homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12432)|
| 3:27:19| so much less cluster and much less noise in that, I guess, in the end of those yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12439)|
| 3:27:27| So I appreciate your time and service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12447)|
| 3:27:30| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12450)|
| 3:27:31| Thank you, Mr. Hatton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12451)|
| 3:27:32| Mr. Brachka.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12452)|
| 3:27:34| I'll just respond on a couple of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12454)|
| 3:27:37| The only variance that kind of possibly impacts the external portion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12457)|
| 3:27:45| is that one on the reduction from 25-foot to zero on the corner radiuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12465)|
| 3:27:50| However, that is only for right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12470)|
| 3:27:52| The property owner does not own the adjoining properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12472)|
| 3:27:55| so they're not able to provide the 25-foot right-of-way radiuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12475)|
| 3:28:00| but the design of the road includes a 25-foot curb radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12480)|
| 3:28:06| so they will be meeting that requirement for vehicle access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12486)|
| 3:28:11| The horizontal curb variances, the three that are listed, are internal to the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12491)|
| 3:28:17| and based on the loop layout within the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12497)|
| 3:28:21| they are providing whatever slight distance easements through the curbs there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12501)|
| 3:28:25| but it also helps to, that and the design of being a narrow road, slow down traffic internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12505)|
| 3:28:32| But the conditions that are part of the approval include, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12512)|
| 3:28:36| paving Carpenter Road to 18-foot width from the entrance south to the Carpenter Bridge subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12516)|
| 3:28:44| where improvement was made from Emory to that entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12524)|
| 3:28:49| They will be widening that road to 18 feet as far as additional pavement width there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12529)|
| 3:28:56| and also the slight distance was the other safety issue that was addressed by the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12536)|
| 3:29:01| And on the issue of the peripheral setback, that is a setback that the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12541)|
| 3:29:08| has the authority to approve or deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12548)|
| 3:29:12| The requirement is 35. They've asked for a reduction to 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12552)|
| 3:29:18| As the comment was made, Alicia Vineyards on their approved plan had a 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12558)|
| 3:29:22| I believe the units are probably closer to 30, 35 feet that they do have enclosed porches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12562)|
| 3:29:28| or that extend back probably closer to the 15-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12568)|
| 3:29:33| Mr. Breska, what was the reasoning for reducing the setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12573)|
| 3:29:36| Is there a justification for from 35 to 20, or just is it the preference of the developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12576)|
| 3:29:43| Well, it's the preference of the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12583)|
| 3:29:46| Actually, this is the third time that this concept has been before the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12586)|
| 3:29:51| and they had requested it in the previous and was approved in previous approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12591)|
| 3:29:57| The depth of the lots that back up to Alicia Vineyards is about 115 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12597)|
| 3:30:03| and they requested to—it's probably better for them to address the reason for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12603)|
| 3:30:09| but it gives them a little more flexibility in unit placement on those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12609)|
| 3:30:13| Thank you. Commissioner Cathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12613)|
| 3:30:17| I think I'm fine, but to the lady in opposition earlier, did you need more time, or are you okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12617)|
| 3:30:24| No, I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12624)|
| 3:30:25| Okay. I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12625)|
| 3:30:28| Commissioner Boston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12628)|
| 3:30:29| Mr. Breska, thank you. Thank you, Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12629)|
| 3:30:32| There was an issue about where the sidewalks were going to be placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12632)|
| 3:30:37| I think—has that been resolved? I got an email. I can't find it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12637)|
| 3:30:42| That's probably the next one. There are sidewalks proposed within this development, within the loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12642)|
| 3:30:48| And Mr. Davis is fine with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12648)|
| 3:30:50| Well, we had actually recommended sidewalks, and they gave us a revised plan that included them in the Dorchester plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12650)|
| 3:30:56| Okay, great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12656)|
| 3:30:59| We were told by the developer that there would be no sidewalks when we had a meeting with Mr. Davis on the 24th of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12659)|
| 3:31:09| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12669)|
| 3:31:13| I'm very familiar with this piece of property. I grew up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12673)|
| 3:31:19| The fact that they're going to widen the road from here down to the next, anything that widens Carpenter Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12679)|
| 3:31:25| it's skinny, tiny, and scares me to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12685)|
| 3:31:31| It scared me to death every time I drove up and down it, which was for years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12691)|
| 3:31:35| And I don't—you know, this was kind of the home place, and I don't like seeing it go to a development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12695)|
| 3:31:42| but it's a matter of property owners' rights and land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12702)|
| 3:31:48| And Mr. Davis has gone down the whole gambit, which isn't the first time we've seen this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12708)|
| 3:31:54| He's doing his best to do a good development on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12714)|
| 3:31:59| And I think we don't have any—the Knox County Engineering, like Mr. Bretzko said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12719)|
| 3:32:04| they're the ones who recommend these variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12724)|
| 3:32:08| And the fact that we're getting a wider road halfway up Carpenter Road, I think, is a positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12728)|
| 3:32:15| You've got to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12735)|
| 3:32:19| So I'm going to make a motion that we approve variances one through four, the existing access strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12739)|
| 3:32:26| And site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12746)|
| 3:32:31| and the proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12751)|
| 3:32:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12755)|
| 3:32:41| Motion by Clancy to approve variances one through four because existing access strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12761)|

| 3:32:56| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12776)|

| 3:34:14| The subdivision is Denali.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12854)|
| 3:34:16| The applicant developer is Masonic Investments, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12856)|
| 3:34:20| Location, the east side of Hitchin Post Drive, south of Ball Camp Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12860)|
| 3:34:26| Approximate acres, 6.4 acres, zoning is PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12866)|
| 3:34:31| Existing land use is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12871)|
| 3:34:34| Proposed use, detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12874)|
| 3:34:37| Number of lots is 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12877)|
| 3:34:40| There are no subdivision variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12880)|
| 3:34:42| There are two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12882)|
| 3:34:44| One is a staff recommendation to approve the concept plan subject to nine conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12884)|
| 3:34:49| The other is to approve the development plan up to 28 detached dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12889)|
| 3:34:53| on individual lots and the requested reduction of the peripheral setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12893)|
| 3:34:58| to 25 feet as identified on the concept plan subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12898)|
| 3:35:03| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12903)|
| 3:35:05| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12905)|
| 3:35:08| Applicant, you've got five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12908)|
| 3:35:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12911)|
| 3:35:12| I'm Drew Statton, PO Box 11385, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12912)|
| 3:35:18| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12918)|
| 3:35:19| I know it's been a long one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12919)|
| 3:35:21| It's just to condition number three, so I guess line item three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12921)|
| 3:35:25| If there was a disconnect during this developer review meeting, we apologize on our end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12925)|
| 3:35:29| It was our understanding following the meeting that the sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12929)|
| 3:35:33| either internal or on the Hitchin Post road frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12933)|
| 3:35:36| was more of a one or the other situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12936)|
| 3:35:39| And so we're agreeable to one or the other, not both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12939)|
| 3:35:43| And we believe that, as well as I believe that Knox County Engineering felt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12943)|
| 3:35:46| it would probably be more beneficial to this proposed subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12946)|
| 3:35:50| the adjacent subdivision, to have the sidewalk along the Hitchin Post frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12950)|
| 3:35:54| especially given the vicinity to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12954)|
| 3:35:57| So I just wanted to clarify that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12957)|
| 3:36:00| And I'll try to add to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12960)|
| 3:36:04| The approval as recorded by the Planning Commission for the rezoning of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12964)|
| 3:36:08| did not have a condition for sidewalks attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12968)|
| 3:36:11| The rezoning approval by the County Commission had the condition attached of sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12971)|
| 3:36:17| It's not clear where that sidewalk is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12977)|
| 3:36:20| We would defer to the recommendation or the request from Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12980)|
| 3:36:29| that it be on Hitchin Post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12989)|
| 3:36:31| That would allow connectivity to sidewalks on Shod Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12991)|
| 3:36:35| and probably better serve the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12995)|
| 3:36:37| And I believe, if I understood Mr. Stanton, you wanted one or the other, not both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=12997)|
| 3:36:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13002)|
| 3:36:43| And I think that would not only address your concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13003)|
| 3:36:46| but also provide better service to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13006)|
| 3:36:49| and meet the intent of the County Commission that they just said a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13009)|
| 3:36:54| They weren't real clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13014)|
| 3:36:56| And I think that was a long evening also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13016)|
| 3:37:00| And I can't remember which commissioner at the County Commission made that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13020)|
| 3:37:05| I think it was Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13025)|
| 3:37:08| I think this would meet the intent of the County Commission also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13028)|
| 3:37:13| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13033)|
| 3:37:15| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13035)|
| 3:37:17| There's no opposition, I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13037)|
| 3:37:21| I'd like a motion that we approve the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13041)|
| 3:37:24| subject to the nine conditions changing condition three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13044)|
| 3:37:28| sidewalk along Hitchin Post frontage as shown on the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13048)|
| 3:37:38| Motion by Commissioner Clancy to approve the concept plan subject to nine conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13058)|
| 3:37:43| modifying number three, have the sidewalk on Hitchin Post versus internal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13063)|
| 3:37:49| Second by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13069)|
| 3:37:51| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13071)|

| 3:39:17| as recommended by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13157)|
| 3:39:22| Mr. Bretschke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13162)|
| 3:39:23| Just very briefly on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13163)|
| 3:39:26| we've been working with the applicant to try to get a site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13166)|
| 3:39:29| that would address site distance issues for the proposed duplex on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13169)|
| 3:39:35| When I talked to him this past week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13175)|
| 3:39:38| he indicated that he intended to withdraw the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13178)|
| 3:39:41| We have not received an official request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13181)|
| 3:39:44| When we did the staff report, we didn't have that from him at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13184)|
| 3:39:48| So we were continuing recommending postponement to next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13188)|
| 3:39:52| see if we can get that withdrawal request from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13192)|
| 3:39:55| If not, we will be recommending denial so we can officially take care of this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13195)|
| 3:40:00| at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13200)|
| 3:40:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13201)|
| 3:40:02| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13202)|
| 3:40:03| Motion to postpone the use on review until the November 14th, 2019 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13203)|
| 3:40:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13210)|
| 3:40:13| Motion by Commissioner Clancy, seconded by Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13213)|
| 3:40:16| to postpone the use on review until the November 14th meeting as recommended by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13216)|
| 3:40:21| Before you get away, we do have two more items, three more, two more items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13221)|
| 3:40:27| This is the Planning Commission's annual report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13227)|
| 3:40:30| and I'll turn it over to Gerald for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13230)|
| 3:40:34| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13234)|
| 3:40:35| All in favor of the previous, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13235)|
| 3:40:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13238)|
| 3:40:39| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13239)|
| 3:40:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13240)|
| 3:40:41| Counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13241)|
| 3:40:43| It's been a long afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13243)|
| 3:40:45| I'll be fairly quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13245)|
| 3:40:47| I do have talking points here from the annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13247)|
| 3:40:50| So I'll go over those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13250)|
| 3:40:52| The major takeaway in the annual report is that we've tried to increase the outreach to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13252)|
| 3:41:00| through a number of methods, improved website, our story maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13260)|
| 3:41:08| We've done a greater outreach with public meetings, trying to go to different places, different times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13268)|
| 3:41:13| and we've succeeded in that both with the update of the zoning code, our Hardin Valley mobility plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13273)|
| 3:41:22| the Chapman Highway implementation study, the John Zavier Scenic Highway portal plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13282)|
| 3:41:29| where we found that ice cream, free ice cream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13289)|
| 3:41:31| was a great incentive to get people to come out on Sunday afternoons to public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13291)|
| 3:41:36| We also have some additions to staff over the past years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13296)|
| 3:41:42| Laura Edmonds, who works with you quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13302)|
| 3:41:45| Kelly Byard, who helps with our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13305)|
| 3:41:49| Savannah Robertson, who does the smart traps and a number of other items in the transportation planning division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13309)|
| 3:41:55| Michelle, who's added greatly to the success of our meetings, or maybe the length of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13315)|
| 3:42:03| And Lindsey Crockett, who's our historic preservation planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13323)|
| 3:42:09| And we also met Aubrey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13329)|
| 3:42:12| She's actually and will be reported in the next annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13332)|
| 3:42:16| We've done better signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13336)|
| 3:42:20| You notice our signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13340)|
| 3:42:21| We think they're a great deal better at providing information to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13341)|
| 3:42:26| We've reconfigured it with our new office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13346)|
| 3:42:29| We've had an emphasis on customer service, and that's worked well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13349)|
| 3:42:32| We've created Groundbreakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13352)|
| 3:42:34| I don't know how many of you have looked at the Groundbreakers app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13354)|
| 3:42:38| We'll send that to you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13358)|
| 3:42:40| It tracks all the development activity in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13360)|
| 3:42:43| and we actually received a comment yesterday from a marketing firm in Atlanta telling us what a great job our staff does that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13363)|
| 3:42:52| and the information we provide is better than any other agency or organization they deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13372)|
| 3:42:57| It made us feel real good about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13377)|
| 3:42:59| We've had a number of major projects this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13379)|
| 3:43:03| You've recommended approval of two of them today, the Hard Valley Mobility Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13383)|
| 3:43:10| and the Chapman Highway Implementation Strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13390)|
| 3:43:13| The new zoning ordinance was a significant undertaking, and who knows where that will go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13393)|
| 3:43:20| I hope we just continue to see it as our new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13400)|
| 3:43:24| I will state that we're trying to keep track of the activity with the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13404)|
| 3:43:30| So far it's been positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13410)|
| 3:43:32| I think today you did do one comparable zone where it went from Rn4 to Rn5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13412)|
| 3:43:39| Rn4 was comparable to the existing zoning, but we were kind to the new owner of the property and decided on Rn4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13419)|
| 3:43:46| We have another one coming up where city council recommended Rn4 for a piece of property that had been industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13426)|
| 3:43:52| and the owners want IMU, and we may talk them into another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13432)|
| 3:43:56| They want to do craft industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13436)|
| 3:43:58| Something that is attached to the annual report and came in a bit late is our annual financial statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13438)|
| 3:44:03| We did well again this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13443)|
| 3:44:05| There were some items that's federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13445)|
| 3:44:10| Now be quiet over there, you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13450)|
| 3:44:15| We handle a lot of federal grants, and there was some variation in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13455)|
| 3:44:20| Our fees and charges, which we rely on for an important part of our funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13460)|
| 3:44:27| was actually above our budgets, about $16,000 above the budgeted amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13467)|
| 3:44:33| We didn't spend as much as we took in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13473)|
| 3:44:37| We had our fund balance increases, and it reminds me of when I had my own business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13477)|
| 3:44:43| Unlike most city departments, if you have a fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13483)|
| 3:44:46| it just disappears and goes back to the city or the county at the end of the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13486)|
| 3:44:50| We get to keep hours to do things like our office renovations, new equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13490)|
| 3:44:54| tablets for the computers for the planning commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13494)|
| 3:44:59| maybe some additional training and activities for you in the coming years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13499)|
| 3:45:03| We try to use that money efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13503)|
| 3:45:06| We have to keep a certain amount in our fund balance because we do work with federal grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13506)|
| 3:45:11| and we have to be able to pay money before we get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13511)|
| 3:45:16| Often these are reimbursement grants, and we have to be able to pay that money before we get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13516)|
| 3:45:21| Raises for the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13521)|
| 3:45:24| We mentioned that, and I think Commissioner Crowder brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13524)|
| 3:45:29| I thought the extra desserts was the payback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13529)|
| 3:45:33| That is the pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13533)|
| 3:45:34| That is the salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13534)|
| 3:45:36| I ate my share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13536)|
| 3:45:39| What am I doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13539)|
| 3:45:41| I'm here for Article 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13541)|
| 3:45:47| And I've waited all afternoon while everybody got extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13547)|
| 3:45:51| And you got quite an education, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13551)|
| 3:45:53| I sure have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13553)|
| 3:45:54| It was on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13554)|
| 3:45:55| That was on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13555)|
| 3:45:58| It passed in the first 15 minutes of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13558)|
| 3:46:02| That was on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13562)|
| 3:46:03| The C beside it on the agenda means it's a consent item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13563)|
| 3:46:07| Smart Hospitality LLC, number 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13567)|
| 3:46:11| Yes, sir, and that was read as one of the items on the consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13571)|
| 3:46:15| and that was approved with that discussion as part of the overall consent agenda at the beginning of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13575)|
| 3:46:21| It was approved when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13581)|
| 3:46:23| At the beginning of the meeting as part of the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13583)|
| 3:46:26| I've been here all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13586)|
| 3:46:27| I never heard it came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13587)|
| 3:46:30| It was read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13590)|
| 3:46:35| It was number 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13595)|
| 3:46:36| When they did the consent, that big, long list of things that went on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13596)|
| 3:46:42| they read a lot of the numbers, about three-fourths of them, it was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13602)|
| 3:46:50| And they said, before they read it, they said, listen carefully, because once these are passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13610)|
| 3:46:55| they won't be discussed again, they'll be passed as a group lot, and they were passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13615)|
| 3:47:00| And 1215 Everett Road, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13620)|
| 3:47:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13623)|
| 3:47:04| Well, I just want you to know I appreciate your time, and I guess I have got education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13624)|
| 3:47:14| But I was up here 25 years ago for this same piece of property when it was put up for a mulching company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13634)|
| 3:47:26| and they agreed that they would give them a six-month trial period because it was zoned agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13646)|
| 3:47:35| and they would notify me when the six-month was up if they were going to approve it for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13655)|
| 3:47:47| Well, it's been over 25 years, and I haven't heard from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13667)|
| 3:47:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13671)|
| 3:47:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13674)|
| 3:47:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13675)|
| 3:47:57| Is there a motion for adjournment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13677)|
| 3:47:58| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13678)|
| 3:48:01| I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13681)|
| 3:48:02| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191010?start=13682)|
