| 0:00:00| Councilman Daly? Here. Councilman Becker? Absolutely. Vice Mayor Brown? Here. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=0)|
| 0:00:19| Frost? Here. Councilman Hall? Here. Councilman Hultquist? Here. Councilman Pilo? Here. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=19)|
| 0:00:27| Roddy? Here. Councilman Woodhull? He's out in the hall. Does that count? Can I get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=27)|
| 0:00:36| motion to approve the minutes? Second. Any discussion? All in favor say aye. Aye. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=36)|
| 0:00:48| Woodhull has arrived. Yes. Amerigo. Could you come up to the microphone please? Could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=48)|
| 0:01:13| you give us your name and address please? David Blackburn, 2425 Douglas Glen Lane, Franklin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=73)|
| 0:01:19| Tennessee. Officer Huskey? No applicable record on all applicants. I have one owner. I've not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=79)|
| 0:01:27| got his fingerprints yet. Ms. Martin? We're looking for a final approval from the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=87)|
| 0:01:34| department, health department, and task program certification. We are scheduled for the task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=94)|
| 0:01:43| program tomorrow evening. Thursday. Or excuse me, Thursday evening, excuse me. And then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=103)|
| 0:01:49| other approvals, I'm told by codes, are forthcoming any time now. Move approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=109)|
| 0:01:56| pending final documentation. Second. Councilman Becker? Yeah, we've got an owner that hasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=116)|
| 0:02:04| been in for processing, correct? I'm not willing, that is true, correct? Yeah, I'm not willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=124)|
| 0:02:11| vote for anything who hasn't been in to do the processing. I think, well I can comment on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=131)|
| 0:02:17| but I think Mr. Blackburn can as well. Yes, he is a very small minority partner in a group of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=137)|
| 0:02:23| partnerships and he was out of the country. He is going in the morning when he returns to get his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=143)|
| 0:02:29| fingerprints done and we'll overnight him over here right away. Can you comment on the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| in not getting that done prior to tonight? I think the problem is that they only process fingerprints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| in Brentwood one day a week and that is on Wednesday. That's correct, that's where he resides, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=159)|
| 0:02:46| originally we didn't think his ownership was large enough to require fingerprints and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| and so we asked him to go back to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| Councilman Roddick? Thank you, Chairman Hall. I recognize the difficulties that this owner had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| and I'm sorry about that, but I just can't vote to approve anybody that hasn't been in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| for processing. I'd be willing to make other considerations in two weeks perhaps if, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| once that comes in, but I'm not, I personally cannot vote to approve this if this person hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| Is there any way we can approve pending satisfactory documentation on Thursday when he gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| this turned in? That's certainly the choice of the beer board, but my personal vote will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| against that motion based upon this information. Yeah, we're scheduled to open very soon. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| Hall, I just wanted to comment on that. Normally I would be agreeing with Miss Roddy, but due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=212)|
| 0:03:39| the fact that there was somehow a miscommunication about the gentleman needing to have his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| fingerprinting done and he was not available until tomorrow, and due to the fact that it's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| understanding, now whether this happens or not, it would be in my mind a slight miracle, but they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=231)|
| 0:03:58| plan to open, I believe you told me, the 6th or 7th. Yes, ma'am, that's correct. Of November, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| would be prior to our meeting on the 20th, so it would prevent an opening which they planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=244)|
| 0:04:13| Councilman Becker. Yeah, I guess I'm actually real concerned about this because this is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| in that category of your building permits where somebody checks a box and it's either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| if it's checked you can get it, if it's not checked you can't. This, if something comes in that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| that there is something in the background, I don't think the, it's our job to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| decide what to do on that, so I don't think this is something that we can say pending final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| documentation because it's a judgment call. Well, it is a judgment call and unfortunately it was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| miscommunication call between someone here in Knoxville and the ownership. Let me comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=285)|
| 0:04:52| I don't know if you all are familiar with Miragos or not, but I believe I'm correct in saying they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| have six restaurants and I know they have one in Nashville, I know they have one in Brentwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| because by chance I've eaten in both of them. So they are, they operate within regulations in other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=301)|
| 0:05:11| cities, it's just that in Knoxville there's a little bit different requirement which they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| not aware of and normally I wouldn't be advocating for this, but this is another wonderful addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=315)|
| 0:05:21| to Knoxville's. Thank you. We have a very nice upscale restaurant and very much in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| with every community that we operate and he's an 8% or slightly under 8% owner I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=325)|
| 0:05:32| that contributed. I think that Officer Husky, we spoke about this today and we had a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| about his judgment in regard to this and so I would like for him to make the same comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| to you that he made to me. If I receive the prints and the background check, I can notify Wanda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=343)|
| 0:05:51| if he's cleared or not and she holds the permit pending all the documentation anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| but of course that's a call up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=356)|
| 0:06:03| Councilman Bailey. Thank you, Chairman. What would happen if when we do this check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=363)|
| 0:06:10| and we find out this person has a bad reputation, bad record, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=370)|
| 0:06:16| Well, as Officer Husky just said, he'll communicate with us what he sees and if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| anything questionable comes up, I'm not releasing a beer permit. We're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=381)|
| 0:06:27| bring it back before the board or at least have a conversation with council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| Thank you. I can assure you there'll be no issues with this particular individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| Councilman Roddy. Thank you, Chairman Hall. With due respect to Councilman Pilo, I do think it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=397)|
| 0:06:44| her job to advocate for her district and I completely understand her position. I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=404)|
| 0:06:50| I have to be consistent with all the businesses that we consider and whether or not a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| is an upscale restaurant or a small mom-and-pop bar, for me personally, I can't approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| unless everyone has been in for fingerprinting. However, as I implied earlier, if a special call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=422)|
| 0:07:09| beer board meeting in two weeks is a possibility once those prints are in, I certainly would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| willing to support that measure if that would allow them to open on time. And the will of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=432)|
| 0:07:19| beer board may be to go ahead and pass this on final documentation, but for me personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| I can't support that motion. Councilman Hopeless. I think I would concur with those statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=443)|
| 0:07:31| Councilman Becker. Yeah, I would hate if the motion to approve is denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=451)|
| 0:07:38| these people are in much worse shape than if a motion to postpone passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| And I think it might be smart to do a test vote on a motion to postpone. Because if, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=463)|
| 0:07:51| we would create quite a worse situation for these folks if we denied their permit than if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| postponed it. So I'm going to make a motion to postpone for two weeks. Second that. I just have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=476)|
| 0:08:07| one comment I'd like to make, please, Chairman Howe. Ms. Roddy made a comment that I think put me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| in a position I felt very uncomfortable about, and that was to indicate that an upscale restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| was certainly more important to me or more important to this beer board than a small mom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| and pop, I believe she said, facility. And I just want to indicate this has nothing to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=505)|
| 0:08:34| upscale, has nothing to do with the price on the menu, has nothing to do with the fact that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| eaten there except that I think I can attest to their reputation. And that was what I was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| And I don't in any way want anyone sitting out here who's coming before us for a permit to ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| think that I feel differently toward one individual than I do to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=531)|
| 0:08:59| So I just felt I need to clear that up. I realize this is a very important situation for everyone here to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=539)|
| 0:09:07| sure that all the documentation is in. And believe me, if we had known, I would have had that way in advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=547)|
| 0:09:13| like all the other documentation that we pulled together. This gentleman, very fine, upstanding person in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| community, and there will be absolutely no issues with his background check. But I realize you need to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| proof of that. And I have no concern whatsoever that if you approve pending the receipt of that, that there would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| any issue that would hold this up and make us delay for another 30 days. I just, there will not be any delay once you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| see that his background is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me ask you again, when did you say you planned on opening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| November the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| And when is our next city council meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| November the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| November the 6th. And this was the problem that I saw that we faced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| Consequently, it wasn't so much of an advocacy as it was just the reality of the dates possibly preventing them from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=593)|
| 0:10:06| opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| Well, I think, Ms. Pelo, I just feel real strongly, I don't want to, I want to stick with the way we do this, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=610)|
| 0:10:18| there are a few things that were real clear that we need to have. Do we have a workshop on November 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=618)|
| 0:10:26| I mean, I know it's a workshop day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| We technically do not have a workshop, but there's a public property naming committee meeting on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| And there has also been a discussion about a potential workshop that day, but we've got public property naming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| committee, so we do have a function at 5 o'clock that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| And I believe that's correct, Mr. Chairman. Is that correct, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| That's correct. And it won't last very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| But that would not necessarily include all council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| Okay. We have a motion before us to postpone to the next, for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=654)|
| 0:11:01| November 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| To November 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| Well, that does not allow them to open on their.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| What time are you going to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| That morning, 11 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| They could still open. They just couldn't sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| They couldn't sell beer for a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| For a few hours, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| They couldn't sell beer until after 7 o'clock that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| There's not a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| I'd say they probably don't have a whole lot of business that drinks beer in the mornings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| Can they serve, if they have their, I guess their ABC permitting process is separate from us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| so they could, if it's 6 o'clock or 5 o'clock cocktail hour, they can serve cocktails and wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| They just can't serve beer on the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| Well, they can't serve with their meals at lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| Actually, I don't even think they can have beer in the facility until they've got a permit issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=706)|
| 0:11:57| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| We're voting to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| Who might want to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| Yeah, I need a roll call, I think, on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| I think that's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| You have been postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| We, Vice Mayor Brown, brought up the possibility of having a specially called beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| Was there any desire to do that at some point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| Do we want to work through the city recorder's office and try to work something out with you possibly between now and then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=778)|
| 0:13:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| If I'm with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| I would move that we strongly consider a special beer board meeting, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| I could take another motion to put that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| I made that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| So what is the motion exactly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| Because we got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| We just approved a motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| So this would be a substitute based on certain conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| I don't believe you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| I think we need a motion to reconsider what we just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| I'll move that we reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| You can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| You lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| I'll move to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| We have to have six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Just five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| Same meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| It's the same meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| It's five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| We're voting on a motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| Now you make another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| Oh, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| I'd like to suggest, I mean, sort of the idea of working through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| recorder's office seems a lot more complicated than us just saying right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| now when we're going to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| I think for these gentlemen who are from out of town it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| Well, if they're, I mean, they're here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| I mean, what I would hate to have happen is for it to take four days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| for this to get done and all of a sudden we can't do public notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| until November 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| So I think I'd actually like to say Thursday, November 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| I mean, that's a workshop time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| We should all have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Several people will be here for a meeting anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| At 5 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| At 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| And conceivably, I don't think both of you need to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| I'm not even sure if we need somebody from the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| When is Councilman Bailey's meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| But we can do this first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| Let's say 445 then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| It won't take long to do this first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| Yeah, 5 o'clock and we'll just wait until we're finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| Please note, I won't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| So we have a motion to postpone until November 1st at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=910)|
| 0:15:19| I thought Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| He seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| Yeah, I seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| You have some?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| Thank you very much for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| That's very kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| High School Highway Marathon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| Chairman, do we have a note to withdraw this permit application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| What, what, what, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| This applicant has withdrawn their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| Don't we have another one at the same place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| We have another one by the same name at the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=959)|

| 0:16:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| And one's withdrawn and one's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=965)|

| 0:16:08| Vote on the withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| We're voting on the withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| And are we withdrawing the right one, do we think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| Now, High School Highway Marathon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| Could you give us your name and address, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| Warren Pisek, 629 Taylor Maid Ranch Road, West Jefferson, North Carolina, 286,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| well, you don't need my zip code, I guess, 28694.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| We're waiting on a copy of the sales tax registration and fire inspector's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| I have the sales tax number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| I went down there and received it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| Do you want me to bring it up or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| I'll move approval pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| I'm sorry, but I did have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| We're not, this is Asheville Highway Marathon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| I think it's the same location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| We do have the pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| Just different people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| Yeah, I bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| I think somebody else thought they were going to buy the property, and that never went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| So I purchased the property, and that other person withdrew because they never bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| My copy just didn't have the task certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| We do have the task program certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| And we didn't ask, and I felt like since we had just had a discussion for the first time, folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| I thought we should clear that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1071)|
| 0:18:13| I'm probably not pronouncing that one very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1093)|
| 0:18:23| Would anybody else have a better pronunciation of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1103)|
| 0:18:30| So, Chairman Hall, I would just move that since we don't have an applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| that we move this to the end of the regular agenda, I guess before the administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| I would have not known they were called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| Do you want to spell it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1125)|
| 0:18:52| Bring in a specialist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| Not for food and drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| We have a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| We have requested a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1140)|

| 0:27:24| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| Oh, Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| We've got to hear from Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| Basically, we would like you all, since we have been approved correctly, to be reconsidered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| Whether or not we go in front of the revocation suspension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| I believe everybody should have in front of them some bullet points that I sent out today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| that I would like to have weighed in on the situation and be willing to discuss any of those with anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1670)|
| 0:28:00| Just like I said last month, we take this very, very, very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1680)|
| 0:28:06| and we've tried to be a very good citizen in our area down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| and a good steward to the fact that we're very close to the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| We have a lot of young people down there, and we have a good overall track record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| Like I said before, both employees are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| We have a very stiff program in place, and we did get in touch with the Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1703)|
| 0:28:31| gave them a copy of our remedial plan, got some feedback from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| They said that it looked good as far as all the guidelines that they proposed that you put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| and I would just ask that you all consider our overall track record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| and that we are committed and continue to be committed to completely keeping underage drinking off of the strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1726)|
| 0:28:58| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| I just, as the maker in the motion to send you, I was impressed by your plan when you were here a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1741)|
| 0:29:08| I just have a policy when there are two violations without carding to send it on to a suspension revocation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| so I don't plan to be making any motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| And just for clarity's sake, if nothing happens here, you don't get sent to a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| So if nobody says anything, you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| Thank you, Chairman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| I don't plan on making a motion this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| I do want to acknowledge that Mr. Clark was kind enough to contact me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| and I hope other members of the beer board to discuss this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| and his plan to address this deficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| I do think they take it very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| I need to go on record as saying that I shared with Mr. Clark this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| he and I both have teenagers, and he talked about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| one violation or two violations might not push you over the edge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| and we talked about, you know, one underage drinking can be a loss of a young person in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1803)|
| 0:30:09| And I am a member of the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| I completely appreciate the fact that you sent your plan to them for their review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| I think that was an added step that was very important, and I'm not going to make a motion on this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| but one mistake can be the loss of one young person in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| And I do take this very seriously, and I think Mr. Clark agrees with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| We talked about sharing that with our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| that I don't expect them to comply 80 percent of the time or 90 percent of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| I expect my children and the businesses that serve that fragile population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| and all businesses, for that matter, to comply 100 percent of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| Well, I would concur with some of the comments Ms. Strotti made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| and I just would say that I appreciate very much Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| I think he attempted to contact all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| I know we had a lengthy conversation this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| And I think he takes very seriously the position he's in, the responsibility he has there, and with his employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1863)|
| 0:31:13| And I would go on to say that he made a point to me, which when I consider that population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1873)|
| 0:31:22| and it is a very fragile population, and I have a teenage granddaughter who's a freshman at UT this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| and certainly living on campus and say a little prayer for her every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1888)|
| 0:31:35| But I think Mr. Clark does take that responsibility seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| and it's regrettable that we had this error, clerical error, that has brought him back to us to request this this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1900)|
| 0:31:49| But maybe it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| It never hurts to be a little bit more reminded of the responsibility, and I think Mr. Clark would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1911)|
| 0:31:58| I really appreciate the efforts to which you are going, and I think it should be stated that your record is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1918)|
| 0:32:06| And I believe the way you stated it to me was there were four years and two months with absolutely no citations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1926)|
| 0:32:13| no problems with any checks that were made, and I'm sure they were frequently checking your establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1933)|
| 0:32:21| So I do think it is important to underline that, that that is a good record when you consider how difficult it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1941)|
| 0:32:31| to operate an establishment on the strip, as we call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| And I just wish you well in continuing to work toward that kind of a good record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1955)|
| 0:32:42| Councilman Hopeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| Well, as I said at our previous meeting when this came up before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| I know Mr. Clark from the Cumberland Avenue Merchants Association meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| and believe him to be someone who cares very much about the community and about Cumberland Avenue area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| and about his business and the integrity of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| So it was a difficult vote for me last time, but I shared Councilman Becker's and Councilman Roddy's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1982)|
| 0:33:10| And like them, I'm not planning on making a motion tonight, but I still very much have those same concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=1990)|
| 0:33:21| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| Is there any other business that needs to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071023?start=2011)|
