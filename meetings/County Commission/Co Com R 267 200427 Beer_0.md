| 0:05:15| uh, dismissing this one? Would that be the proper motion considering their lack of showing up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-beer?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| That would be it to withdraw for failure to appear. Okay, uh, the Chair will entertain a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-beer?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| motion to that effect. This is, uh, Commissioner Andrews. I'll make a motion that they do not show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-beer?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| in this meeting that they withdraw or withdraw the application. Okay, and I believe, is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200427-beer?start=330)|
