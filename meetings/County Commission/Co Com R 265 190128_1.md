| 2:57:45| Chicken and the egg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10665)|
| 2:57:46| And we've got a chicken and the egg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10666)|
| 2:57:47| So you can't have a growth plan, a general plan, that goes against the state plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10667)|
| 2:57:53| And so if we don't start by finding a way to have a new general plan that fits into the urban growth plan, it's 20 years out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10673)|
| 2:58:02| Everybody agrees it's out of date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10682)|
| 2:58:05| And even if we pass the new general plan, if it doesn't fit the growth plan, it's illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10685)|
| 2:58:09| Correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10689)|
| 2:58:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10691)|
| 2:58:12| And so we don't have the people that agree that we need to change the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10692)|
| 2:58:17| The city won't come to the table or has been told the commissioners that they won't come to the table because it doesn't benefit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10697)|
| 2:58:24| And I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10704)|
| 2:58:25| That's a management decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10705)|
| 2:58:26| I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10706)|
| 2:58:28| But the county has to take care of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10708)|
| 2:58:30| And we can't go keep going forward by kicking a rock down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10710)|
| 2:58:35| We do it on infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10715)|
| 2:58:36| We do it on school buildings that we, you know, we've talked about, Adrian Burnett, for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10716)|
| 2:58:43| We're kicking the can down the road on everything, and we try to fix something the logical way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10723)|
| 2:58:50| and now MPC says we need the urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10730)|
| 2:58:54| It's been our stumbling block for proper planning for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10734)|
| 2:58:58| Now, we do need to change our codes for mixed use development, cluster developments, and town center type developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10738)|
| 2:59:04| We need all that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10744)|
| 2:59:06| But the things that are within the urban growth plan, we can't pass a general plan that goes against the urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10746)|
| 2:59:12| And so we've got to fix that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10752)|
| 2:59:14| And I'm all for a new general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10754)|
| 2:59:15| I think Knox County needs a new plan for the next 10, 15, 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10755)|
| 2:59:20| but we can't plan for the next 20 years on a plan that was approved 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10760)|
| 2:59:24| So we've got to find a solution to send to the state to fix it, and that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10764)|
| 2:59:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10768)|
| 2:59:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10769)|
| 2:59:30| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10770)|
| 2:59:31| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10771)|
| 2:59:34| When they started the urban growth plan, it was mandated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10774)|
| 2:59:37| and some of the issues that were given to us was done by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10777)|
| 2:59:42| The biggest problem we have right now is that the urban growth plan has not been followed in the style in which it was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10782)|
| 2:59:54| A lot of people have done things against the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10794)|
| 2:59:57| and where we're at right now is we've got set by precedent for letting some of these developments happen within that growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10797)|
| 3:00:06| that we really can't deny other developers that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10806)|
| 3:00:10| So what we need to do is someone said to put teeth back in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10810)|
| 3:00:14| So what you're going to have to have is you're going to have to have a Knox County plan to substitute for the state plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10814)|
| 3:00:23| and present it to the state at one time and say we want to do away with this, but here's what we've got to replace it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10823)|
| 3:00:30| And we've tried this for years, and here we are talking about it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10830)|
| 3:00:34| Now, unless we start today, even if we start today, we're two years behind where we should be at to get it changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10834)|
| 3:00:43| And like I said before, I see communities develop as communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10843)|
| 3:00:47| and not by one big cookie cutter plan for every section of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10847)|
| 3:00:54| And we really need to start, we call it sector plans, but those sector plans don't always hold true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10854)|
| 3:01:02| So we've got to have something in our hands when we go down to do what we want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10862)|
| 3:01:08| and say here it is, let's change it, and they will change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10868)|
| 3:01:11| If not, we're going to be mandated again by the state and Knox County is going to be left in a situation we can't develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10871)|
| 3:01:19| like we should develop, like we know we should be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10879)|
| 3:01:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10883)|
| 3:01:24| All right, thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10884)|
| 3:01:26| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10886)|
| 3:01:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10888)|
| 3:01:31| We received numerous emails and phone calls in the last few days about this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10891)|
| 3:01:41| and it's probably one of the most, one of the biggest problems that Knox County faces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10901)|
| 3:01:49| and we're all faced with that in all of the districts that we represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10909)|
| 3:01:55| And I represent all of Knox County, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10915)|
| 3:02:00| but my number one priority is to take care of District 2, which is out in the north area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10920)|
| 3:02:07| And I want to thank everybody who came out to our meeting this past week to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10927)|
| 3:02:16| We had a great meeting, and I saw that we can have everybody from all over Knox County come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10936)|
| 3:02:22| because the number one thing I hear all of us saying is we care about Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10942)|
| 3:02:29| We live in the best place there is to live and work and raise a family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10949)|
| 3:02:33| and we get one chance to develop, and we need to make sure we have it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10953)|
| 3:02:39| And I may not live to see any of the decisions that I make up here on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10959)|
| 3:02:44| I mean, who knows? None of us may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10964)|
| 3:02:47| What I do and what I am accountable for is to the people in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10967)|
| 3:02:52| and to the people in my district to plan for our future, to plan for my grandkids and my children's future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10972)|
| 3:03:01| because we see Hardin Valley is getting ready to graduate their 11th graduation class from Hardin Valley High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10981)|
| 3:03:09| Look how fast the time has gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10989)|
| 3:03:12| That was 11 years ago, but many years before then, we had Pellissippi College built down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10992)|
| 3:03:20| And I remember, and I'm going to say, boy, you're really old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11000)|
| 3:03:24| Yes, I am. I am getting old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11004)|
| 3:03:26| But I can remember when there was really nothing past Walker Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11006)|
| 3:03:31| There was a Holiday Inn because I'll never forget my dad was offered to buy some stock in that when I was just little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11011)|
| 3:03:41| And later on, we were like, man, that wasn't that much, but yes, it was a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11021)|
| 3:03:45| And my daddy always said a frog's had wings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11025)|
| 3:03:48| So anyway, he didn't, and he wished many a times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11028)|
| 3:03:52| And that was the only thing pretty much down that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11032)|
| 3:03:56| So I have seen how it has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11036)|
| 3:04:01| And I grew up and went to church in Concord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11041)|
| 3:04:04| And my sister-in-law is a Farragut High grad, and my brother is a transplant down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11044)|
| 3:04:09| So with all that to say, I know and I've seen how development is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11049)|
| 3:04:14| And now we have a Hardin Valley High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11054)|
| 3:04:17| We have a great Pellissippi College down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11057)|
| 3:04:20| We have a Hardin Valley Middle School and an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11060)|
| 3:04:23| And really, there's nothing been changed to the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11063)|
| 3:04:26| We were fortunate enough to get Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11066)|
| 3:04:29| And boy, what would we have done if we hadn't have ever gotten that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11069)|
| 3:04:33| But when you get off the exit there and all, so our infrastructure and our planning has got to catch up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11073)|
| 3:04:40| because people, everybody, Knox County is not the best kept secret anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11080)|
| 3:04:45| Everybody wants to move to Knox County, and I don't blame them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11085)|
| 3:04:49| So, you know, I see all of us saying we want the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11089)|
| 3:04:55| I think, okay, so what is the right procedure tonight for us as an elected body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11095)|
| 3:05:05| Do we need to withdraw this resolution until, I mean, it's about wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11105)|
| 3:05:12| And as our law director knows, I mean, one word, one word can change the whole outcome of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11112)|
| 3:05:21| So I'm here to say I want to represent the people in Knox County and my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11121)|
| 3:05:28| I want to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11128)|
| 3:05:29| I want to make sure that we grow Knox County and it continues to be the best place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11129)|
| 3:05:36| and we don't end up with everybody saying, oh, I hate to go through Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11136)|
| 3:05:40| Like all of us say, oh, what time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11140)|
| 3:05:43| I'm not going through Atlanta and I'm not going that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11143)|
| 3:05:46| And do you do the bypass or do you go through Atlanta?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11146)|
| 3:05:49| I don't want us to become that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11149)|
| 3:05:52| I want people to be happy and enjoy coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11152)|
| 3:05:55| So all that to say, what is going to be the best approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11155)|
| 3:06:03| And Mayor Jacobs is our leader, and he, you know, we've all got to be on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11163)|
| 3:06:12| And I also want to throw in, if we have a planning group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11172)|
| 3:06:15| I will have to say that the north area and the east area of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11175)|
| 3:06:20| never gets brought into the conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11180)|
| 3:06:23| And so we've got to do this right in our north area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11183)|
| 3:06:28| because we have a great new Gibbs Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11188)|
| 3:06:31| and hopefully we'll have some other new schools with our Adrian Burnett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11191)|
| 3:06:35| that's been put on the back burner for way too many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11195)|
| 3:06:39| We've got a Tassel Pike, Washington Pike, and Millertown Pike issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11199)|
| 3:06:43| And I'm telling you, we have got to get work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11203)|
| 3:06:48| And these next ten years and even next year, I mean, it's crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11208)|
| 3:06:53| It is crucial to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11213)|
| 3:06:55| So I guess I've kind of got on my little box and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11215)|
| 3:06:59| but it's important that we do this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11219)|
| 3:07:03| And I want everybody out there to know in my community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11223)|
| 3:07:06| that we need to bring everybody to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11226)|
| 3:07:09| And I think we're all in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11229)|
| 3:07:11| And so however we can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11231)|
| 3:07:13| either a new growth plan policy or committee or I'm waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11233)|
| 3:07:19| I'm wanting answers, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11239)|
| 3:07:21| Thanks, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11241)|
| 3:07:23| I'm recognizing Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11243)|
| 3:07:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11246)|
| 3:07:28| Hey, Gerald, you can't hide over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11248)|
| 3:07:32| Yeah, we're hidden in the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11252)|
| 3:07:37| You've got to get in the balcony if you don't want to be seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11257)|
| 3:07:51| How are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11271)|
| 3:07:52| Doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11272)|
| 3:07:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11273)|
| 3:07:58| Gerald, the 2003 general plan was derived from the growth policy plan, was it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11278)|
| 3:08:05| It followed the broad outlines of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11285)|
| 3:08:09| especially with regard to the identification of the rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11289)|
| 3:08:13| the urban growth boundaries, and the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11293)|
| 3:08:16| Now, I know it's not a stand-alone plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11296)|
| 3:08:18| but it has some pretty good footing on which we can plan, does it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11298)|
| 3:08:21| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11301)|
| 3:08:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11302)|
| 3:08:23| And the sector plans are derived from the general plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11303)|
| 3:08:26| That's correct, and they're considered updates of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11306)|
| 3:08:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11309)|
| 3:08:31| So if we did away with the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11311)|
| 3:08:36| and nobody's wanting to do away with long-term growth planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11316)|
| 3:08:40| We just want to get unhandcuffed from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11320)|
| 3:08:45| But if we did away with the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11325)|
| 3:08:47| we could follow the general plan we have in place now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11327)|
| 3:08:51| until we were able to update our general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11331)|
| 3:08:54| And I don't think – I think that's one of the challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11334)|
| 3:08:58| With our sector plans based on the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11338)|
| 3:09:01| based on the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11341)|
| 3:09:02| that growth policy plan sets the dictates for density limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11342)|
| 3:09:06| where commercial areas should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11346)|
| 3:09:09| So I believe that's why the planning commission said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11349)|
| 3:09:13| if you want to jettison the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11353)|
| 3:09:16| make a firm commitment to updating the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11356)|
| 3:09:20| so that we have a direction, as Commissioner Carringer said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11360)|
| 3:09:24| and Commissioner Gill, for the entire county that takes into account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11364)|
| 3:09:28| whether it's the northwest or the north or the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11368)|
| 3:09:31| or the central part of the county, that we look at the county comprehensively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11371)|
| 3:09:35| and match the infrastructure needs and the school needs with growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11375)|
| 3:09:39| and take another look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11379)|
| 3:09:41| I think that was one of the good elements of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11381)|
| 3:09:45| bringing those different bodies together to look at how growth can be accommodated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11385)|
| 3:09:49| And it's, I think, shame on all of us, the planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11389)|
| 3:09:52| planning commission, county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11392)|
| 3:09:54| the city of Knoxville and town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11394)|
| 3:09:57| for not updating the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11397)|
| 3:09:59| I think that had some good causes in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11399)|
| 3:10:04| taking away the annexation, trying to match that infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11404)|
| 3:10:08| with the growth of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11408)|
| 3:10:10| But before we had the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11410)|
| 3:10:12| we had general plans and sector plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11412)|
| 3:10:14| That was way before my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11414)|
| 3:10:17| I know we had the general plan, the older plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11417)|
| 3:10:20| and some planning I don't think sector planning was done before the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11420)|
| 3:10:26| I may be mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11426)|
| 3:10:28| And we, what I'm worried about is spending time, money, and effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11428)|
| 3:10:36| a lot of time, a lot of money, a lot of effort by people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11436)|
| 3:10:39| to come up with a new general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11439)|
| 3:10:41| before we know what action we can take with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11441)|
| 3:10:45| Because the state may say, no, you can't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11445)|
| 3:10:47| And then we would have just wasted everybody's time and money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11447)|
| 3:10:49| to develop a new general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11449)|
| 3:10:52| That is a possibility, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11452)|
| 3:10:54| I think it's a very slight possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11454)|
| 3:10:57| I would think that if this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11457)|
| 3:10:59| and especially with the support of the town of Farragut and the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11459)|
| 3:11:04| asked that the growth policy plan be jettisoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11464)|
| 3:11:07| and the new general plan put in its place, they would listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11467)|
| 3:11:11| But I think a better thing is, again, what the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11471)|
| 3:11:14| and some of the people tonight recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11474)|
| 3:11:17| do move with eliminating the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11477)|
| 3:11:21| but make a firm commitment and a commitment that you're willing to live up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11481)|
| 3:11:26| to update the general plan and do that on a fairly fast pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11486)|
| 3:11:30| Because I believe everybody on this commission is truly committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11490)|
| 3:11:33| to making Knox County a better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11493)|
| 3:11:35| You know, we all live here. We all want to live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11495)|
| 3:11:38| We all have kids. We're going to have grandkids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11498)|
| 3:11:40| It's important to us that Knox County be as functional and as friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11500)|
| 3:11:44| and easy to live in as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11504)|
| 3:11:46| I do want to ask you a question about sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11506)|
| 3:11:49| And I want you to think broad about this, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11509)|
| 3:11:53| With the current plan that we have, in some ways it encourages sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11513)|
| 3:11:59| When we've reached those points where we have utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11519)|
| 3:12:01| and we're still restricted to three units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11521)|
| 3:12:04| that means you use that land and then go to the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11524)|
| 3:12:07| instead of getting your maximum utility out of what is available at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11527)|
| 3:12:11| And I'll counter that and I'll say our development pattern promotes sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11531)|
| 3:12:15| We have, for example, in the Northwest Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11535)|
| 3:12:18| we've identified places around the schools for higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11538)|
| 3:12:22| That is skipped over where the higher density is permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11542)|
| 3:12:25| and it's skipped over because the land is cheaper over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11545)|
| 3:12:28| And that's just economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11548)|
| 3:12:31| Which school is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11551)|
| 3:12:33| That's around the Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11553)|
| 3:12:36| All around the schools is higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11556)|
| 3:12:40| And we continue to try to promote that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11560)|
| 3:12:43| And, in fact, we're looking at zoning this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11563)|
| 3:12:47| that would allow up to an apartment development within the growth boundaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11567)|
| 3:12:53| trying to promote denser development where it's currently permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11573)|
| 3:12:57| And, again, the market forces don't always align| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11577)|
| 3:13:02| with what we'd like to see in terms of limiting sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11582)|
| 3:13:05| But if we could come up with a plan, a new plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11585)|
| 3:13:09| that allowed us to have concentrations of employment centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11589)|
| 3:13:15| commercial districts, town centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11595)|
| 3:13:19| ways that allow us to be more walkable, more bikeable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11599)|
| 3:13:24| and less transient by car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11604)|
| 3:13:26| a lot of that's kind of left out of what we're locked into right now, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11606)|
| 3:13:30| It is, and some of that is because our general plan was done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11610)|
| 3:13:33| about 20 years ago before they became as important as they are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11613)|
| 3:13:40| In your opinion, as a planner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11620)|
| 3:13:42| 20 years is a long time to have a plan that's not been updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11622)|
| 3:13:45| It's a lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11625)|
| 3:13:48| You know, people keep saying, well, we could reconvene these committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11628)|
| 3:13:53| If it were that easy, it would have been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11633)|
| 3:13:55| I've been talking about this for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11635)|
| 3:13:57| I can get nobody to ever want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11637)|
| 3:14:02| And with the way the annexation laws are right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11642)|
| 3:14:06| there's no skin in the game for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11646)|
| 3:14:08| The city doesn't want to negotiate with us because there's nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11648)|
| 3:14:14| there's no give and take there as before there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11654)|
| 3:14:17| There were the urban growth area and the area that they could annex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11657)|
| 3:14:24| I think this commission is very willing to make a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11664)|
| 3:14:28| to put out money and to put out time to make a new general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11668)|
| 3:14:33| I feel we need it desperately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11673)|
| 3:14:36| I think the current plan that we have is causing some of the problems that we are experiencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11676)|
| 3:14:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11684)|
| 3:14:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11685)|
| 3:14:46| I'm going to call on Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11686)|
| 3:14:48| but I also want to say to my fellow commissioners and to our guests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11688)|
| 3:14:52| as I mentioned earlier tonight, at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11692)|
| 3:14:55| we will convene the zoning portion of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11695)|
| 3:14:59| This falls under famous last words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11699)|
| 3:15:02| The agenda before us for zoning is the majority of those items came to us on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11702)|
| 3:15:08| I don't anticipate that being a lengthy meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11708)|
| 3:15:12| We will plan on, after Commissioner Schoonmaker's comments on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11712)|
| 3:15:16| having County Commission go into recess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11716)|
| 3:15:19| and then we will convene the, we'll take a ten-minute break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11719)|
| 3:15:22| and then we will have this body go into recess and then go into zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11722)|
| 3:15:28| and then come back to take this up where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11728)|
| 3:15:32| That's my call as chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11732)|
| 3:15:35| Just a second, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11735)|
| 3:15:37| I've got Commissioner Schoonmaker was first to be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11737)|
| 3:15:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11741)|
| 3:15:43| When the growth plan was enacted almost 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11743)|
| 3:15:48| the state had a path to follow to be able to amend your growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11748)|
| 3:15:55| Out of the 95 counties in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11755)|
| 3:15:58| 30 counties have already amended their growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11758)|
| 3:16:03| and it's a very simple procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11763)|
| 3:16:05| And the procedure is that all they have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11765)|
| 3:16:12| a county can propose amendments to the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11772)|
| 3:16:15| by filing notice with the county mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11775)|
| 3:16:18| and the mayor of every city in that jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11778)|
| 3:16:21| Upon receipt of the notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11781)|
| 3:16:23| the county mayor must take action to reconvene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11783)|
| 3:16:27| or reestablish the coordinating committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11787)|
| 3:16:30| within 60 days of the receipt of the notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11790)|
| 3:16:34| The coordinating committee is then reestablished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11794)|
| 3:16:37| and uses the original process to amend the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11797)|
| 3:16:41| Now, we've heard that the city doesn't want to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11801)|
| 3:16:45| but I've never seen any document that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11805)|
| 3:16:48| that Mayor Rojero and city council is refusing to join this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11808)|
| 3:16:56| We've already heard the town of Farragut wants to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11816)|
| 3:16:59| I think if anything this body should do is withdraw this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11819)|
| 3:17:03| and make a motion that the county mayor reconvene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11823)|
| 3:17:07| the growth policy coordinating committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11827)|
| 3:17:09| And then he has 60 days to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11829)|
| 3:17:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11832)|
| 3:17:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11834)|
| 3:17:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11835)|
| 3:17:16| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11836)|
| 3:17:18| As I said earlier, that's actually a great point, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11838)|
| 3:17:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11841)|
| 3:17:23| What I'd like to do is allow this body to go on a 10-minute recess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11843)|
| 3:17:27| you know, take a 10-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11847)|
| 3:17:28| We will go into, and I will entertain a motion for us to go into recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11848)|
| 3:17:32| We'll take recess with the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11852)|
| 3:17:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11854)|
| 3:17:35| The motion on the floor was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11855)|
| 3:17:37| Motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11857)|
| 3:17:38| Motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11858)|
| 3:17:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11859)|
| 3:17:40| We have a motion on the floor from Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11860)|
| 3:17:43| and we have a proper second on it, which was to request for the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11863)|
| 3:17:48| I'm going to restate it to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11868)|
| 3:17:50| to request that the mayor reconvene the coordinating committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11870)|
| 3:17:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11874)|
| 3:17:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11875)|
| 3:17:56| We have to put him on notice and the other two mayors in our jurisdiction on notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11876)|
| 3:18:03| And to withdraw the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11883)|
| 3:18:07| I mean, withdraw the current resolution on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11887)|
| 3:18:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11892)|
| 3:18:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11893)|
| 3:18:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11894)|
| 3:18:15| That motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11895)|
| 3:18:18| Now is when, and we're butting right up, that motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11898)|
| 3:18:23| We now move into discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11903)|
| 3:18:25| However, as I've been clear, we are butting up right against the time where we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11905)|
| 3:18:31| You can't recess without a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11911)|
| 3:18:34| If you're going to have a discussion, it's going into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11914)|
| 3:18:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11916)|
| 3:18:37| And I'm not ready to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11917)|
| 3:18:39| So you can either withdraw your motion and make it after zonings, or we'll sit here and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11919)|
| 3:18:43| Mr. Chairman, because of the clock, why don't we go ahead and withdraw my motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11923)|
| 3:18:49| and restate it after the zoning portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11929)|
| 3:18:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11932)|
| 3:18:53| That would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11933)|
| 3:18:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11934)|
| 3:18:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11935)|
| 3:18:56| Now I'd like to entertain a motion for us to go into a 10-minute, to go into recess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11936)|
| 3:19:03| and then we will convene back here at 10 minutes after 7 to open the zoning compotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11943)|
| 3:19:08| Is there a motion for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11948)|
| 3:19:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11950)|
| 3:19:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11951)|
| 3:19:12| I saw the motion, actually, from Commissioner Daley, raised his hand in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11952)|
| 3:19:15| Andrews-Kerringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11955)|
| 3:19:16| Andrews-Kerringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11956)|
| 3:19:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11957)|
| 3:19:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=11958)|

| 3:21:16| Business Park Type 1 for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=12076)|

| 3:21:22| Business Park designation in the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=12082)|

| 3:38:06| to the Knox County Mayor, to the City of Knoxville Mayor and the Town of Farragut Mayor to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13086)|

| 3:38:20| item number 35R-19-1-907 be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13100)|

| 3:38:29| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13109)|
| 3:38:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13110)|
| 3:38:31| Motion has been made by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13111)|
| 3:38:32| It's been seconded by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13112)|
| 3:38:36| Now we can begin discussing the motion that is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13116)|
| 3:38:39| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13119)|
| 3:38:41| Yeah, I think that's probably a way to begin the process, but I also hate to leave out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13121)|
| 3:38:53| if we do not have participating partners and miss another legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13133)|
| 3:38:58| And so, being of the same mind that we need to change our general plan and the urban growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13138)|
| 3:39:04| plan, I'll make a substitute motion to continue with the resolution just in case the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13144)|
| 3:39:14| parties choose not to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13154)|
| 3:39:17| And we can add to the resolution that giving Knox County permission to opt out with two-thirds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13157)|
| 3:39:25| vote of county commission if we feel the need to opt out of the urban growth plan if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13165)|
| 3:39:31| other body does not choose to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13171)|
| 3:39:34| That way this does not delay us another year of fixing our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13174)|
| 3:39:39| That would be my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13179)|
| 3:39:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13181)|
| 3:39:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13182)|
| 3:39:43| We have a substitute motion from Commissioner Anders and we have, looks like, I see Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13183)|
| 3:39:49| Smith, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13189)|
| 3:39:50| Is that a second or is that for discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13190)|
| 3:39:52| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13192)|
| 3:39:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13193)|
| 3:39:54| Is there a second for your substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13194)|
| 3:40:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13202)|
| 3:40:03| I'm not seeing a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13203)|
| 3:40:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13207)|
| 3:40:08| That motion does not receive a second, so it will die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13208)|
| 3:40:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13212)|
| 3:40:13| We now have a back-to-discussion of the original motion at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13213)|
| 3:40:18| I'm not sure which of your two lights, Commissioner Carringer's came on and yours, Mr. Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13218)|
| 3:40:22| so go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13222)|
| 3:40:24| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13224)|
| 3:40:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13225)|
| 3:40:26| Go ahead, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13226)|
| 3:40:27| Well, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13227)|
| 3:40:29| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13229)|
| 3:40:33| I just wanted to say that I don't think that Talent Farragut or our city at all have actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13233)|
| 3:40:42| been given a proper invitation to come to the table on this, and so I don't know whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13242)|
| 3:40:53| I need to make this a motion or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13253)|
| 3:40:56| There's already a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13256)|
| 3:40:57| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13257)|
| 3:40:58| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13258)|
| 3:40:59| So anyway, okay, I'm just putting it out there that I don't know that we have actually given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13259)|
| 3:41:06| the proper invitation to the city or to the Town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13266)|
| 3:41:10| So I guess that's my take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13270)|
| 3:41:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13274)|
| 3:41:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13275)|
| 3:41:16| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13276)|
| 3:41:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13278)|
| 3:41:25| The indication we're giving to the Knox County legislative body at the state is that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13285)|
| 3:41:31| indecisive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13291)|
| 3:41:33| We're never going to get their help on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13293)|
| 3:41:35| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we vote on the original resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13295)|
| 3:41:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13303)|
| 3:41:44| There is a motion on the floor from Commissioner Smith to go back to voting on the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13304)|
| 3:41:51| resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13311)|
| 3:41:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13312)|
| 3:41:53| And there is a second from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13313)|
| 3:41:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13316)|
| 3:41:57| So, to restate, we're back to the original motion on the floor, which was the one as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13317)|
| 3:42:06| written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13326)|
| 3:42:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13327)|
| 3:42:08| Is there any discussion on that substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13328)|
| 3:42:11| Commissioner Schoonmaker, I recognize Commissioner Schoonmaker, then Daly, then Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13331)|
| 3:42:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13337)|
| 3:42:22| I guess at this point I don't see the need to involve the State of Tennessee in a Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13342)|
| 3:42:29| County decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13349)|
| 3:42:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13350)|
| 3:42:31| Since 30 other counties in the state have been able to amend their growth plan, it almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13351)|
| 3:42:37| looks like that we're asking the state for special permission over the other 94 counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13357)|
| 3:42:46| to do something with our growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13366)|
| 3:42:49| And I think as the third largest county in Tennessee, that we should follow the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13369)|
| 3:42:55| and guidelines as the other counties in Tennessee have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13375)|
| 3:42:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13379)|
| 3:43:00| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13380)|
| 3:43:02| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13382)|
| 3:43:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13383)|
| 3:43:04| I also agree with Commissioner Carragher and Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13384)|
| 3:43:08| We need to have the opportunity to invite the Town of Farragut, which you already heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13388)|
| 3:43:13| from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13393)|
| 3:43:14| Has anyone really asked the City of Knoxville to come to the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13394)|
| 3:43:18| I think we all have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13398)|
| 3:43:21| I will be voting no on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13401)|
| 3:43:24| Who knows, next year, maybe we lose this legislation this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13404)|
| 3:43:29| But still in 2020, there's no guarantee that the State of Tennessee is going to renew this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13409)|
| 3:43:34| It's a sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13414)|
| 3:43:36| It could die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13416)|
| 3:43:37| Possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13417)|
| 3:43:38| I'm not saying it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13418)|
| 3:43:40| It's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13420)|
| 3:43:43| The State Legislature will address it, but I think it doesn't die on its own resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13423)|
| 3:43:49| I don't think we need to be in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13429)|
| 3:43:50| I think we need to be with the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13430)|
| 3:43:52| Let the citizens have a voice, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13432)|
| 3:43:54| But first, let's talk to the Town of Farragut and the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13434)|
| 3:43:58| We'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13438)|
| 3:43:59| If they refuse, we'll come back next month and do another resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13439)|
| 3:44:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13444)|
| 3:44:05| Thank you, Commissioner Daly, Commissioner Smith, and then I'll move to Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13445)|
| 3:44:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13448)|
| 3:44:09| To come back next month with a resolution going to the state legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13449)|
| 3:44:12| we all know that that's too late to try to get anything done this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13452)|
| 3:44:16| The 30 counties that have done this are much smaller counties that are not nearly as complex as the dynamics that we have here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13456)|
| 3:44:25| I know this is tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13465)|
| 3:44:27| It's going to be a tough process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13467)|
| 3:44:28| I think the public doesn't trust us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13468)|
| 3:44:31| I think a little bit of this whole recode Knoxville has got people a little weary of zoning and planning in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13471)|
| 3:44:39| I think we owe it to Knox County and Knox County's future to try to fix a problem that every one of us knows is a problem and has been for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13479)|
| 3:44:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13492)|
| 3:44:53| Thank you, Commissioner Smith, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13493)|
| 3:44:55| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13495)|
| 3:44:56| One of the things we want to show the public that we're not indecisive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13496)|
| 3:45:00| why don't we also ask the mayor to start a process of forming these community-type organizations for input for each community on what their ideas are for a future growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13500)|
| 3:45:11| Therefore, we've already got an action showing that we are trying to advance forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13511)|
| 3:45:15| Now, if this motion going forward, like Commissioner Schoonmaker happens to die with people not coming to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13515)|
| 3:45:25| then we can already show that we're processing it away and have the community already set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13525)|
| 3:45:31| It's going to take a little while to organize the communities and get their ideas of what that future growth plan should be for their area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13531)|
| 3:45:40| Is there some way that we could start the process without really wanting to show them that we are serious in what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13540)|
| 3:45:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13551)|
| 3:45:53| I want to just comment on that for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13553)|
| 3:45:56| Commissioner Bussler asked about starting the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13556)|
| 3:45:58| I'm going to recognize Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13558)|
| 3:46:00| I'll probably make a statement myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13560)|
| 3:46:03| And then as it relates specifically to Commissioner Bussler's statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13563)|
| 3:46:07| I'm going to ask Gerald Green just to weigh in because I think your question was more about starting a process, too, on that, which I think that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13567)|
| 3:46:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13580)|
| 3:46:21| I want to get clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13581)|
| 3:46:23| We've had so many substitute motions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13583)|
| 3:46:25| Madam Clerk, where exactly are we on the current motion on the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13585)|
| 3:46:31| The current motion is to approve as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13591)|
| 3:46:33| As is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13593)|
| 3:46:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13594)|
| 3:46:35| We're still into discussion mode on that motion just to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13595)|
| 3:46:37| Oh, go ahead, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13597)|
| 3:46:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13599)|
| 3:46:40| And let me say I think the constituents of Knox County recognizes that the maturity of this body recognizes we need a process to look at how we can manage the infrastructure, utilities, and the capacity to lead this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13600)|
| 3:46:56| It is time to take a look at the level of components and stakeholders and leadership in this county and not do it simply ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13616)|
| 3:47:07| I think the public is mature enough to understand that we need to take a broader approach and to have people at the table to help us make the best possible decisions we possibly can make for the county and not for ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13627)|
| 3:47:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13642)|
| 3:47:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13643)|
| 3:47:24| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13644)|
| 3:47:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13645)|
| 3:47:26| Commissioner Carrington's light is on, and I will get to her, but she's also already talked on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13646)|
| 3:47:30| With Robert's rules of order, we try to let everybody speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13650)|
| 3:47:37| Mr. Green, I'm going to get to you talking about some process on this, but I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13657)|
| 3:47:43| I've heard a lot of us talk about both updating the general plan as well as updating the growth plan, and that's one of the conundrums that this whole thing is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13663)|
| 3:47:54| I've heard some great insights on the importance of updating the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13674)|
| 3:47:59| Maybe you update it, get it fixed, and then once that's done, you say, okay, state, we've got an updated general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13679)|
| 3:48:07| Now exempt us from the growth plan once that's done so you don't have a gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13687)|
| 3:48:11| I've heard from, frankly, an MPC commissioner about, well, one thing that you can avoid in some of these conflicts is to just update the whole growth plan itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13691)|
| 3:48:22| because if you update the growth plan, then everything, I guess trickle down is not quite the right word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13702)|
| 3:48:28| but everything transitions down into the county general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13708)|
| 3:48:35| This is as much for the community as it is for this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13715)|
| 3:48:40| What is the difference between updating and how much different level of work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13720)|
| 3:48:45| I know that we're mandated by law to pull together the coordinating committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13725)|
| 3:48:49| but if you were to compare and contrast the processes of updating the growth plan versus updating the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13729)|
| 3:48:57| I think that's something everybody wants to get a little bit of a grasp on, and that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13737)|
| 3:49:06| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13746)|
| 3:49:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13747)|
| 3:49:08| I think Mr. Armstrong is awaiting for this answer as much as anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13748)|
| 3:49:13| and I think he's going to grade me on my answers, so be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13753)|
| 3:49:18| The challenge with the growth policy plan is it does take the involvement and the input of the coordinating committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13758)|
| 3:49:27| which, as Commissioner Gil said, can be a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13767)|
| 3:49:32| and hearing about the statement from the vice mayor of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13772)|
| 3:49:36| how the county growth doesn't affect our municipalities and the infrastructure they need to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13776)|
| 3:49:43| to provide transportation through the communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13783)|
| 3:49:48| or coordinating with the county on greenways and parks and recreational facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13788)|
| 3:49:55| And maybe I'm a bit idealistic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13795)|
| 3:49:57| but I'm thinking that if we had the growth policy coordinating committee convened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13797)|
| 3:50:02| and updated the general plan and presented that to the growth policy council, that may be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13802)|
| 3:50:10| I think it's been so long since this was done, the challenge, which was annexation, is out of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13810)|
| 3:50:17| Now, the planning commission and the planning staff work with the municipality of Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13817)|
| 3:50:26| and even with the town of Farragut on a regular basis and see no real competition among them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13826)|
| 3:50:32| They're working together, so again, maybe I'm a bit idealistic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13832)|
| 3:50:35| but I think with that big challenge out of the way of annexation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13835)|
| 3:50:39| that the need to cooperate is more recognizable by all those committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13839)|
| 3:50:47| Again, I hope that we can update the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13847)|
| 3:50:50| and have that take the place of the growth policy plan in many instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13850)|
| 3:50:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13855)|
| 3:50:57| As chair, what I'd like to do is ask Janice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13857)|
| 3:51:02| Could you come forward, if you don't mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13862)|
| 3:51:10| You're chair of MPC, just for some of our guests who don't know her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13870)|
| 3:51:14| I mean, what's your take on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13874)|
| 3:51:18| I mean, you'd said earlier that you thought you'd pushed specifically for an update to the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13878)|
| 3:51:25| when you'd spoke to us earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13885)|
| 3:51:28| Would that be in the context of if the general plan was updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13888)|
| 3:51:32| to then serve as a replacement of the growth plan after the general plan had been fully updated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13892)|
| 3:51:40| I've also heard from equally really solid MPC commissioners as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13900)|
| 3:51:44| some who aren't here to say, well, if you update the growth plan versus the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13904)|
| 3:51:48| if you update the growth plan, and that's what we're hearing some of my fellow commissioners here are talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13908)|
| 3:51:54| are all saying, hey, let's just try to do the big thing, get the growth plan updated versus the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13914)|
| 3:52:03| And so I kind of wanted to ask you that same question to get your take as an MPC commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13923)|
| 3:52:07| I know you're not speaking for all of MPC, but as an MPC commissioner, the pros and cons of either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13927)|
| 3:52:14| And I really and truly take my direction from the Knoxville-Knox County planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13934)|
| 3:52:22| I am not a planner by trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13942)|
| 3:52:24| I listen to recommendations, and based on the recommendations, where the master plan can be the master plan, the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13944)|
| 3:52:37| that all the other parts filter down from the master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13957)|
| 3:52:43| Sorry, you used the third term, master plan, so I was going to say growth plan or general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13963)|
| 3:52:48| General plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13968)|
| 3:52:49| I've heard it referred to as master plan and general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13969)|
| 3:52:55| So I think that basically what we're looking for is that Knoxville or Knox County has a plan that can be used for making decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13975)|
| 3:53:08| so that the planning commissioners know what the community wants, knows what Knox County wants, knows what the city wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13988)|
| 3:53:17| So when we're making decisions, we're making the best decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=13997)|
| 3:53:22| I'm like other folks that when I was first appointed to the Metropolitan Planning Commission, as it was then, in 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14002)|
| 3:53:32| this has been a constant, constant discussion about the growth policy plan, about the fact that it is outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14012)|
| 3:53:42| And I, too, have been frustrated that there's not been some action to, if it's outdated, update it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14022)|
| 3:53:51| But all we're looking for is to have some sort of guidance, some sort of plan, so that we know where is Knox County going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14031)|
| 3:54:00| where is the city going, where is the town of Farragut going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14040)|
| 3:54:04| Did that answer the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14044)|
| 3:54:05| Yeah, it does, but just ask a clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14045)|
| 3:54:08| Once again, I know you're speaking for yourself, not for all of your peers on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14048)|
| 3:54:12| If the growth plan was updated versus, say, the general plan first, or if they were both updated at the same time, I mean it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14052)|
| 3:54:24| and I'm just being real specific because the initial discussion was about getting the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14064)|
| 3:54:31| excuse me, the general plan updated when you spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14071)|
| 3:54:34| But I guess, all right, what if the growth plan itself was updated as opposed to just the general plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14074)|
| 3:54:42| I'm sorry for muddying these waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14082)|
| 3:54:44| So you're saying that one or the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14084)|
| 3:54:46| Well, what I'm saying is, there was a motion on the floor earlier about specific to updating the growth plan, the top one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14086)|
| 3:54:57| You had mentioned updating the county general plan, which is based on the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14097)|
| 3:55:02| I can't see that the two can be separated as far as being updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14102)|
| 3:55:07| I would have to defer to Mr. Green on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14107)|
| 3:55:10| But I can't see that the two, if we're updating the growth policy plan, then the general plan needs to also be updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14110)|
| 3:55:19| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14119)|
| 3:55:20| I just want to, yeah, it's like, well, it's sort of a chicken and egg, which one would come first is sort of my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14120)|
| 3:55:24| Which comes first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14124)|
| 3:55:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14125)|
| 3:55:28| As long as we have some tools in our chest to know what planning decisions that we need to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14128)|
| 3:55:36| without a growth policy plan and a master plan, with taking the growth policy plan out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14136)|
| 3:55:44| we're not left with anything with which to make good decisions for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14144)|
| 3:55:50| We don't know how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14150)|
| 3:55:53| Then it becomes like, well, what do we feel like that day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14153)|
| 3:55:56| What do we feel like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14156)|
| 3:55:57| Who's in front of us and making a presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14157)|
| 3:56:00| Without that plan, without having the tools and resources for us to know where things are going, how do we make decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14160)|
| 3:56:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14167)|
| 3:56:08| So we need one or the other, and I don't have a real good answer about which I think is better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14168)|
| 3:56:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14174)|
| 3:56:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14175)|
| 3:56:16| Kim, I'll go ahead and recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14176)|
| 3:56:19| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14179)|
| 3:56:20| I just wanted to try to land this plane really quickly because I'm very much a rule follower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14180)|
| 3:56:25| I think what everyone is trying to say is that we would support a motion to ask the county mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14185)|
| 3:56:35| to reconvene the coordinating committee and call on the town of Farragut and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14195)|
| 3:56:41| And while that is happening, Gerald and his amazing staff could then work on the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14201)|
| 3:56:50| which needs to be updated anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14210)|
| 3:56:53| And then the general plan would then be presented to the coordinating committee as a new growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14213)|
| 3:57:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14227)|
| 3:57:08| So then it's a win-win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14228)|
| 3:57:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14232)|
| 3:57:13| And by the way, Ms. Frazier, would you mind formally stating your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14233)|
| 3:57:17| Kim Frazier, 11835 Couch Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14237)|
| 3:57:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14240)|
| 3:57:21| I'm going to get back to the earliest light was Commissioner Carringer, and then I saw Smith and Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14241)|
| 3:57:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14248)|
| 3:57:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14249)|
| 3:57:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14250)|
| 3:57:31| The way that I understand the thing, the general assembly states that the first step is to reconvene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14251)|
| 3:57:42| So I would like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14262)|
| 3:57:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14269)|
| 3:57:52| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14272)|
| 3:57:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14275)|
| 3:58:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14281)|
| 3:58:02| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14282)|
| 3:58:03| Here's where I was going on that, is if we could ask our mayor to reconvene the coordinating committee, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14283)|
| 3:58:15| but to ask all of those to come to the table, the city of Knoxville, town of Farragut, which we haven't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14295)|
| 3:58:21| and they have, I don't think it's in there, that everybody knows they have 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14301)|
| 3:58:26| And then if they don't come, which I think they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14306)|
| 3:58:31| I mean, you know, they just haven't been asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14311)|
| 3:58:34| Then that's still where I state where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14314)|
| 3:58:38| That's what I think is the fair way to include everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14318)|
| 3:58:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14327)|
| 3:58:48| Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14328)|
| 3:58:49| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14329)|
| 3:58:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14331)|
| 3:58:53| Director Green, the growth policy plan, as long as it's in place, is the guiding document for the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14333)|
| 3:59:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14343)|
| 3:59:04| Now, is it possible to spend money, time, and effort to develop a general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14344)|
| 3:59:09| when you don't know what the coordinating committee is going to pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14349)|
| 3:59:15| I think that's why it's important to go down that path to reconvene the coordinating committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14355)|
| 3:59:21| get their input, keep them in the loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14361)|
| 3:59:24| But, again, I think what Ms. Frazier said is a good route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14364)|
| 3:59:29| and that's what I think what I tried to say is update the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14369)|
| 3:59:35| working with the coordinating committee and have that general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14375)|
| 3:59:38| then serve as the growth policy plan as well as the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14378)|
| 3:59:43| Quit having so many layers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14383)|
| 3:59:45| Have one layer, that general plan slash growth policy plan is the foundation for planning in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14385)|
| 3:59:51| and then build on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14391)|
| 3:59:54| How this commission wants to proceed, that's what I would recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14394)|
| 3:59:58| but how this commission wants to proceed is up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14398)|
| 4:00:00| What kind of time frame do you see that process taking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14400)|
| 4:00:03| And I've said before that we do not have the staff capacity to undertake that on our own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14403)|
| 4:00:08| without the assistance of a consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14408)|
| 4:00:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14410)|
| 4:00:11| So we appropriate some money, you hire a consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14411)|
| 4:00:14| What kind of time frame do you see this taking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14414)|
| 4:00:16| Probably about a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14416)|
| 4:00:18| You think it can be done in a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14418)|
| 4:00:19| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14419)|
| 4:00:21| With the aid of a consultant from the date they start to completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14421)|
| 4:00:28| And that is a consultant on the general plan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14428)|
| 4:00:31| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14431)|
| 4:00:35| Again, we're the elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14435)|
| 4:00:38| This is a tough decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14438)|
| 4:00:41| I'm going to ask each of you all to look at yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14441)|
| 4:00:43| and make a decision on what you think is best for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14443)|
| 4:00:47| Not just the political pressure, but what you think is going to work best for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14447)|
| 4:00:56| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14456)|
| 4:00:59| Commissioner Anders, then Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14459)|
| 4:01:01| Mr. Law Director, if the mayor asked to convene the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14461)|
| 4:01:06| does the committee by law have to show up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14466)|
| 4:01:15| By law he has to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14475)|
| 4:01:17| The law doesn't address whether they have to come or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14477)|
| 4:01:20| but he can request it to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14480)|
| 4:01:23| If they're not done, it leaves us right in the conundrum we're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14483)|
| 4:01:27| with a growth policy plan that addresses the location of the urban area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14487)|
| 4:01:35| the growth area, and the rural area with no planning attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14495)|
| 4:01:40| So we have to fall back on the general plan to cover the growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14500)|
| 4:01:45| and the rural area as far as Knox County is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14505)|
| 4:01:50| And that's what you all are dealing with right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14510)|
| 4:01:52| So if you get a growth, if they come to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14512)|
| 4:01:57| they have some input on the growth area, the city's wood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14517)|
| 4:02:03| The county still is in charge of the rural area as to however our policies are on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14523)|
| 4:02:09| and we would need a plan or the general growth plan would take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14529)|
| 4:02:16| So it's a matter of how you want to do the planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14536)|
| 4:02:19| When we did this the last time through the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14539)|
| 4:02:23| it took about two years plus mediation plus a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14543)|
| 4:02:29| I don't know what the pressure is on the two metropolitan areas now, to do or not to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14549)|
| 4:02:35| That's all policy stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14555)|
| 4:02:38| But to answer your question, you can direct the mayor to do something and he, quote, shall do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14558)|
| 4:02:45| But he has no leverage to make anybody to come to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14565)|
| 4:02:49| All right. Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14569)|
| 4:02:51| Mr. Law Director, I'm going to ask him a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14571)|
| 4:02:53| Yeah, I'm not recognizing Mr. Smith to speak on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14573)|
| 4:02:56| I'm recognizing Mr. Smith to specifically ask a question to the law director on his statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14576)|
| 4:03:01| Mr. Law Director, you said that the city, under the original intentions of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14581)|
| 4:03:10| they had some influence in the growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14590)|
| 4:03:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14595)|
| 4:03:16| But they also do have some influence on our rural area to the point that they cannot approve our plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14596)|
| 4:03:22| if they don't like what we're going to do with our rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14602)|
| 4:03:25| That's true. It's a cooperative effort between all the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14605)|
| 4:03:28| Otherwise, this growth policy plan will drive everything you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14608)|
| 4:03:35| Bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14615)|
| 4:03:37| But you also have the authority over the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14617)|
| 4:03:41| The whole purpose of this act, even though it talks about infrastructure and education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14621)|
| 4:03:47| and a bunch of side issues, which the statute says may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14627)|
| 4:03:54| but where the shalls come is you shall create an urban growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14634)|
| 4:03:58| you shall create a growth plan area, and you shall create a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14638)|
| 4:04:04| That's what is statutorily required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14644)|
| 4:04:08| Whether we have a community development corporation or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14648)|
| 4:04:11| we've always had one of those before the plan, during the plan, and after the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14651)|
| 4:04:16| even though that is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14656)|
| 4:04:18| So you can still have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14658)|
| 4:04:21| Whatever decision you make, the decision you're faced with is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14661)|
| 4:04:24| how do you want to do planning for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14664)|
| 4:04:27| And right now you have an urban growth plan that is not complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14667)|
| 4:04:35| because the three parties voted to sunset the optional piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14675)|
| 4:04:41| So we have the areas as defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14681)|
| 4:04:44| But we don't, as Director Green is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14684)|
| 4:04:48| they don't have anything but the general plan to apply to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14688)|
| 4:04:52| because we don't have anything underneath it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14692)|
| 4:04:55| And when you're talking about abolishing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14695)|
| 4:04:58| you're talking about to give the general plan the power over all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14698)|
| 4:05:03| If you want to go the other route through the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14703)|
| 4:05:06| then you're talking about the urban growth plan driving the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14706)|
| 4:05:13| Is that the way you would see it, Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14713)|
| 4:05:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14715)|
| 4:05:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14716)|
| 4:05:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14718)|
| 4:05:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14719)|
| 4:05:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14720)|
| 4:05:21| We have, in order, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14721)|
| 4:05:25| I lost the floor to his question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14725)|
| 4:05:28| Okay, so I'll go to Commissioner Anders and then Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14728)|
| 4:05:31| And then back to Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14731)|
| 4:05:33| Mr. Green, you said that you didn't have staff for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14733)|
| 4:05:37| Did we bring in consultants for what the city is going through with RICO?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14737)|
| 4:05:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14742)|
| 4:05:43| About what did that cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14743)|
| 4:05:44| I don't think ours will be that complex, but what did theirs cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14744)|
| 4:05:48| Their contract amount was $300,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14748)|
| 4:05:50| but they've spent significantly less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14750)|
| 4:05:53| They're at the almost probably 95% completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14753)|
| 4:05:57| I think their billings have been less than $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14757)|
| 4:06:01| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14761)|
| 4:06:03| And I don't think ours would be as complex as theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14763)|
| 4:06:05| Do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14765)|
| 4:06:06| Because we can use kind of the speed bumps that they've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14766)|
| 4:06:09| We can kind of go over those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14769)|
| 4:06:12| with our sector plans and some of the other plans that we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14772)|
| 4:06:16| And so, I mean, going back to what we said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14776)|
| 4:06:19| I think that taking this dual tracker that I suggested earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14779)|
| 4:06:23| that didn't get a second is the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14783)|
| 4:06:26| Because if one of the bodies does not come back in 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14786)|
| 4:06:30| you know, we've missed this legislative session to help ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14790)|
| 4:06:33| And we can't, there's no use in working on a general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14793)|
| 4:06:36| if it's controlled by the urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14796)|
| 4:06:38| I mean, that's wasting money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14798)|
| 4:06:40| So, I still think the dual track is the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14800)|
| 4:06:43| And I think we have an opportunity right now to set the tone for future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14803)|
| 4:06:48| And I think we're missing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14808)|
| 4:06:49| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14809)|
| 4:06:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14810)|
| 4:06:51| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14811)|
| 4:06:52| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14812)|
| 4:06:54| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14814)|
| 4:06:56| My suggestion a while ago was whichever plan you go with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14816)|
| 4:07:00| whether you go with one or the other, which path you want to take, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14820)|
| 4:07:07| Let's get on a path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14827)|
| 4:07:09| What we need to do right now, if we do the 60-day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14829)|
| 4:07:12| then we don't need to wait to 60 days to find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14832)|
| 4:07:15| if these people are going to come together to start the path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14835)|
| 4:07:18| What we need to do right now is to go to, as the mayor says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14838)|
| 4:07:24| our customer out here and find out what they want for their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14844)|
| 4:07:29| And each person has a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14849)|
| 4:07:31| We need to start the process of that organization through the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14851)|
| 4:07:36| So whatever we do, when we come there, we've got information to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14856)|
| 4:07:41| that they're telling us what they want for themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14861)|
| 4:07:44| and us not telling them what they're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14864)|
| 4:07:47| I've got an organizational chart started so they can give us information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14867)|
| 4:07:53| So when we're looking at these and give Gerald his, what they think they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14873)|
| 4:07:59| and see if it will fit in some of the plans that might be set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14879)|
| 4:08:03| We just need to organize the county to tell us what we need to do for them on that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14883)|
| 4:08:08| Thank you, Commissioner Busler. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14888)|
| 4:08:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14891)|
| 4:08:13| I think we're missing a point here in that in my motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14893)|
| 4:08:20| I'm directing the chairman of Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14900)|
| 4:08:24| to notify the other mayors in our jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14904)|
| 4:08:28| that we intend to amend our growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14908)|
| 4:08:34| not throw it out, not star over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14914)|
| 4:08:37| not throw out the city of Knoxville's growth plan or have them amend theirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14917)|
| 4:08:43| or throw out the town of Farragut's or amend the town of Farragut's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14923)|
| 4:08:49| So I don't understand why we have this illusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14929)|
| 4:08:54| that the city of Knoxville won't come to a meeting when it doesn't affect them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14934)|
| 4:08:58| other than that they just need to show up for that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14938)|
| 4:09:03| I also have reservations that if we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14943)|
| 4:09:07| with some kind of resolution before the Tennessee General Assembly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14947)|
| 4:09:11| I don't think it's going to get out of the local government subcommittee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14951)|
| 4:09:15| like it did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14955)|
| 4:09:17| Because, again, why should they grant special privileges to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14957)|
| 4:09:24| So, Mr. Chairman, I'll call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14964)|
| 4:09:26| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14966)|
| 4:09:28| The question has been called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14968)|
| 4:09:30| According to Robert's Rules of Order, that compels us to take a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14970)|
| 4:09:35| That means you vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14975)|
| 4:09:38| You vote on the question. You don't automatically go to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14978)|
| 4:09:42| I want to make sure he's called the question. It's been a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14982)|
| 4:09:44| Mr. Law Director, clarify the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14984)|
| 4:09:46| When the question is called, you vote on whether you answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14986)|
| 4:09:52| First, if the question is called, is affirmed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14992)|
| 4:09:56| then you vote on the motion with no more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14996)|
| 4:09:59| Once a question is called, discussion ceases, you vote on the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=14999)|
| 4:10:04| After that, if the question prevails, you vote on the motion, discussion ceases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15004)|
| 4:10:09| Okay. So let's clarify the question of what we are voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15009)|
| 4:10:14| We're voting we're not to cease debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15014)|
| 4:10:16| The question is, do we want to cease debate on this topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15016)|
| 4:10:24| Equivalently, by calling the question, Commissioner Schoonmaker has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15024)|
| 4:10:31| if you vote in the affirmative, you're saying you'd like to have discussion ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15031)|
| 4:10:38| I want to make sure that's clear so everybody knows what they're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15038)|
| 4:10:41| And if you vote no, you would like for discussion to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15041)|
| 4:10:50| This has nothing to do with the actual motion on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15050)|
| 4:10:54| So just to clarify for all of our folks in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15054)|
| 4:10:57| Does the call require a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15057)|
| 4:11:00| No, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15060)|
| 4:11:02| So what the chair will now do is I'm going to call for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15062)|
| 4:11:08| If you vote yes, you would like to see the debate cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15068)|
| 4:11:14| If you vote no, you'd like to have the debate continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15074)|
| 4:11:18| Roll call vote, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15078)|
| 4:11:19| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15079)|
| 4:11:21| Sorry, I've got another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15081)|
| 4:11:23| I have a question for our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15083)|
| 4:11:25| Okay, go ahead and ask it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15085)|
| 4:11:26| It's not really discussing, it's just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15086)|
| 4:11:28| Point of order, this is not the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15088)|
| 4:11:30| You've got the call, no more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15090)|
| 4:11:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15092)|
| 4:11:33| Once again, if you vote yes, you want discussion to cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15093)|
| 4:11:36| If you vote no, you'd like the discussion to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15096)|
| 4:11:42| This will be a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15102)|
| 4:11:44| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15104)|
| 4:11:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15106)|
| 4:11:47| Commissioner Schoonmaker votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15107)|
| 4:11:50| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15110)|
| 4:11:51| I'm voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15111)|
| 4:11:52| Out of respect, there's another lot on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15112)|
| 4:11:54| Commissioner Anders votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15114)|
| 4:11:56| Commissioner Bessler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15116)|
| 4:11:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15118)|
| 4:11:59| Commissioner Bessler votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15119)|
| 4:12:00| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15120)|
| 4:12:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15121)|
| 4:12:02| Commissioner Beeler votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15122)|
| 4:12:03| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15123)|
| 4:12:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15125)|
| 4:12:06| Commissioner Daly votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15126)|
| 4:12:07| Commissioner Jay is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15127)|
| 4:12:09| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15129)|
| 4:12:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15130)|
| 4:12:11| Commissioner Biggs votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15131)|
| 4:12:13| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15133)|
| 4:12:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15135)|
| 4:12:16| Commissioner Gill votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15136)|
| 4:12:17| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15137)|
| 4:12:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15139)|
| 4:12:20| Commissioner Carringer votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15140)|
| 4:12:21| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15141)|
| 4:12:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15142)|
| 4:12:23| Commissioner Smith votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15143)|
| 4:12:25| Commissioner Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15145)|
| 4:12:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15146)|
| 4:12:27| Commissioner Nystrom votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15147)|
| 4:12:32| 4-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15152)|
| 4:12:34| What was the pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15154)|
| 4:12:36| 4-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15156)|
| 4:12:37| 4-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15157)|
| 4:12:38| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15158)|
| 4:12:39| Discussion will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15159)|
| 4:12:41| Thank you for trying to keep moving this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15161)|
| 4:12:43| I haven't seen any more lights on, so I haven't seen any new stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15163)|
| 4:12:45| All right, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15165)|
| 4:12:47| Commissioner Carringer's light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15167)|
| 4:12:49| Okay, and the reason I voted no for this is because I wanted to ask our law director some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15169)|
| 4:12:57| so that I understand fully and maybe everyone else does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15177)|
| 4:13:02| Okay, so in the motion that John made, and I seconded, we will ask the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15182)|
| 4:13:10| and we will ask the city of Knoxville to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15190)|
| 4:13:13| So I asked our law director, I said, okay, I mean, I personally feel they will come to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15193)|
| 4:13:20| but we've got to ask them and get their answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15200)|
| 4:13:24| So I asked our law director, what if we do ask them and they don't come to the table, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15204)|
| 4:13:31| Are you referring to the city of Knoxville only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15211)|
| 4:13:35| Because you've already heard a statement from the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15215)|
| 4:13:38| Well, we heard, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15218)|
| 4:13:41| She was representing the mayor herself and the two other board of aldermen for the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15221)|
| 4:13:48| Well, okay, I mean, I'm just talking about our motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15228)|
| 4:13:53| So I'm asking him, if they don't come, where does this put us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15233)|
| 4:13:58| Okay, because of, I understand what John's saying too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15238)|
| 4:14:02| We are in, you know, our state legislators and all that, we have known on some other passages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15242)|
| 4:14:12| in the past two years where they have kind of singled Knox County out and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15252)|
| 4:14:19| well, this is what Knox County does or wants and we're not going to do in the other counties or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15259)|
| 4:14:26| So correct, Mr. Commissioner Schoonmaker on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15266)|
| 4:14:30| We've seen that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15270)|
| 4:14:32| So I understand what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15272)|
| 4:14:34| If it's just Knox County coming to them and our legislators go to the other counties or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15274)|
| 4:14:41| But I am concerned about our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15281)|
| 4:14:46| And so if we do ask and they don't come, where does this put us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15286)|
| 4:14:50| Going back to the motion that Commissioner Anders was saying, if we do ask and they say no, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15290)|
| 4:14:59| So I'm trying to say, yeah, I mean, well, easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15299)|
| 4:15:07| I mean, anybody can say no or just not show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15307)|
| 4:15:10| I mean, it's, you know, I'm just wondering where it puts us in terms of us getting moving and going for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15310)|
| 4:15:21| A year behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15321)|
| 4:15:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15322)|
| 4:15:23| Well, I mean, if we don't have a plan back up for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15323)|
| 4:15:32| Can I address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15332)|
| 4:15:33| Yeah, go ahead, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15333)|
| 4:15:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15334)|
| 4:15:37| Personally, I think we have a great rapport with the city council and the mayor of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15337)|
| 4:15:46| This is something, I don't understand why there's this impression that they won't show up for a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15346)|
| 4:15:53| Where that all started from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15353)|
| 4:15:55| I mean, I don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15355)|
| 4:15:59| Okay, I'll recognize Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15359)|
| 4:16:02| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15362)|
| 4:16:04| The whole purpose of Recode Knoxville is to increase density within Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15364)|
| 4:16:10| That is why they won't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15370)|
| 4:16:13| Their objection is to have the growth take place within the urban core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15373)|
| 4:16:18| John, you sat here two years ago whenever I asked about how we could do this, and I suggested reconvening these committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15378)|
| 4:16:26| and you told me that was a terrible idea and it would never work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15386)|
| 4:16:30| May I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15390)|
| 4:16:32| Did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15392)|
| 4:16:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15393)|
| 4:16:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15394)|
| 4:16:35| To keep these things civil?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15395)|
| 4:16:36| No, I was going to say, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15396)|
| 4:16:37| The chair recognizes Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15397)|
| 4:16:40| Thank you, and I'll just address his comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15400)|
| 4:16:42| But Commissioner Smith, did you make a resolution and ask, at that time, Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15402)|
| 4:16:51| to convene the Growth Policy Coordinating Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15411)|
| 4:16:54| I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15414)|
| 4:16:55| So how did you say it wouldn't work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15415)|
| 4:16:56| You didn't even try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15416)|
| 4:16:57| So we're here now, we're trying to get it going, and I don't understand why you're trying to throw roadblocks on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15417)|
| 4:17:03| You said it wouldn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15423)|
| 4:17:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15425)|
| 4:17:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15427)|
| 4:17:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15428)|
| 4:17:09| What I'm going to do, I'm a big believer in everybody's, we're going to hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15429)|
| 4:17:12| So, Diane, would you mind, again, I've got my glasses on, but we do have one person from the audience, so come on forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15432)|
| 4:17:22| And please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15442)|
| 4:17:24| Thank you, Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15444)|
| 4:17:26| I'm Diane Montgomery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15446)|
| 4:17:28| I'm a resident of West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15448)|
| 4:17:29| I'm here representing North Shore Corridor Association, as well as Amberleigh Neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15449)|
| 4:17:34| And I just wanted to try to bring another perspective to this, if I may, and I'll try to be as brief as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15454)|
| 4:17:40| We're all tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15460)|
| 4:17:43| I think there are some reasons for you to process tonight, besides the legal constraints and the time constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15463)|
| 4:17:52| and the financial constraints, which I think we all understand pretty well, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15472)|
| 4:17:58| There's another perspective here, and that is that, unfortunately, very unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15478)|
| 4:18:03| when my organization was getting off the ground and we started talking to citizens all around the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15483)|
| 4:18:11| and in various neighborhoods, we were stunned to see the perception out there among the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15491)|
| 4:18:20| of what happens in this building down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15500)|
| 4:18:24| There is a terrible level of distrust and suspicion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15504)|
| 4:18:28| At the same time that that's going on, there seems to be also an unprecedented opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15508)|
| 4:18:34| As we've gotten out and spoken and the various neighborhood groups and some of you who are sitting around tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15514)|
| 4:18:41| have come together to talk, it's a new day in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15521)|
| 4:18:46| There are different people and very smart people and very good people coming into the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15526)|
| 4:18:52| My organization alone is representing several thousand and growing exponentially resident taxpayers of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15532)|
| 4:19:01| who are all crying for a transparent planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15541)|
| 4:19:06| So I think it would be a terrible mistake on your part tonight not to make at least a very public gesture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15546)|
| 4:19:14| to recognize what's going on out there perception-wise in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15554)|
| 4:19:19| And that's kind of the message we're trying to bring to you and bring it as positively as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15559)|
| 4:19:24| You know that, unfortunately, there is already one lawsuit afoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15564)|
| 4:19:31| There will be others if you don't take the citizenry into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15571)|
| 4:19:35| I can just tell you from what I'm hearing and seeing out there on the street, people have had enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15575)|
| 4:19:41| They want to come to the table with you. They want to be partners with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15581)|
| 4:19:44| And I can't believe that the city at this point in time wouldn't try at least to come to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15584)|
| 4:19:50| If they can't, then let's find another path. There are other ways to slice this pie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15590)|
| 4:19:54| So let's give it a try. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15594)|
| 4:19:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15598)|
| 4:19:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15599)|
| 4:20:08| Actually, while she was speaking, one of the commissioners indicated a desire to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15608)|
| 4:20:12| So I'm going to call on Commissioner Gill. Then I'll call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15612)|
| 4:20:15| Go ahead, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15615)|
| 4:20:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I could have yielded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15617)|
| 4:20:19| But I just want to make an observation because I think what is surprising to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15619)|
| 4:20:23| is that for the first time you see public engagement with your commissioners on very critical questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15623)|
| 4:20:30| We've not often had a dialogue and discussion around what it takes to build a better county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15630)|
| 4:20:36| And trust us, this is an open process, as you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15636)|
| 4:20:41| Because, see, that's what learning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15641)|
| 4:20:42| It takes the good, the dirty, and the ugly to put it all on the table to figure out where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15642)|
| 4:20:49| So we are exactly where we need to be discussing a very critical issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15649)|
| 4:20:54| And trust us, we want the public to be engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15654)|
| 4:20:58| This is not the county of 20 years ago. It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15658)|
| 4:21:02| This is not even the commission of 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15662)|
| 4:21:06| And we are actively engaged in trying to build the best possible county we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15666)|
| 4:21:13| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15673)|
| 4:21:15| Now, go ahead, ma'am, if you could please state your name and address for the record when you come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15675)|
| 4:21:20| My name is Robin King. I live at 222 Little Switzerland Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15680)|
| 4:21:24| I'm representing a group of neighbors in South Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15684)|
| 4:21:27| Thank you very much, Commissioner Nystrom and Commissioner Gill, for your statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15687)|
| 4:21:32| and how hard all of you all are working here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15692)|
| 4:21:35| I want to remind you, first of all, I do live in a very rural, urban area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15695)|
| 4:21:39| There's a lot of grading. There's a lot of things going on and developments without permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15699)|
| 4:21:44| and all agencies are ignoring, stopping them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15704)|
| 4:21:48| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15708)|
| 4:21:49| First of all, in reference to Nixon Road, notice of River Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15709)|
| 4:21:53| the Tomboy's Ancient Laura Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15713)|
| 4:21:57| They have graded, made roads, gone through TVA towers, dammed water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15717)|
| 4:22:02| and created this theme park, and there are no permits or plans submitted to MPC to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15722)|
| 4:22:09| So I'm begging you now, please, listen to your citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15729)|
| 4:22:15| Every one of you were voted here for a specific reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15735)|
| 4:22:18| whether it was me voting for Carson Talley for my grandfather's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15738)|
| 4:22:23| Every one of you voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15743)|
| 4:22:24| It doesn't matter how you got here or favors that people want from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15744)|
| 4:22:29| I'm asking you, let us as a group get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15749)|
| 4:22:32| The city, county, and the MPC and the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15752)|
| 4:22:36| it's a beautiful area that needs to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15756)|
| 4:22:39| They need better road structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15759)|
| 4:22:40| I just watched the zoning committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15760)|
| 4:22:42| They were given zoning in an area that is a tragic area for access on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15762)|
| 4:22:48| and we don't have the infrastructure there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15768)|
| 4:22:52| That's right at Bower Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15772)|
| 4:22:55| Shame on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15775)|
| 4:22:56| Shame on all of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15776)|
| 4:22:58| We don't know what's going on, and we're the age where the kids are younger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15778)|
| 4:23:02| and better at using computers than we are to have the knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15782)|
| 4:23:06| Knowledge is power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15786)|
| 4:23:09| So I need each of you to reach down in your hearts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15789)|
| 4:23:12| Are you doing the best thing for your community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15792)|
| 4:23:15| Is your community representing what you're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15795)|
| 4:23:19| How much percentage of the city and of Farragut have to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15799)|
| 4:23:26| to be able to make some sort of agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15806)|
| 4:23:29| Can you give them 30 days and take two-thirds of those people be there to make a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15809)|
| 4:23:35| if all of them don't show?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15815)|
| 4:23:37| They say they want to come, don't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15817)|
| 4:23:40| Then let's give them the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15820)|
| 4:23:43| Why do we have to be so one-sided?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15823)|
| 4:23:45| It's like the Democrats and Republicans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15825)|
| 4:23:50| Please, I beg of you, take time to think about this, what's the best for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15830)|
| 4:23:55| not for just one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15835)|
| 4:23:57| If you had in your backyard what we all have and people were grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15837)|
| 4:24:03| and damming up the water that the state of Tennessee owns, how would you feel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15843)|
| 4:24:12| A quarter of a mile from the back of your yard, your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15852)|
| 4:24:16| We don't have sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15856)|
| 4:24:18| 80 or 90% of our schools are on low-income federal housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15858)|
| 4:24:22| People don't put up the permit signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15862)|
| 4:24:24| We have subsidized housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15864)|
| 4:24:26| I have nothing against subsidized housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15866)|
| 4:24:29| Let's give this community a way that they can grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15869)|
| 4:24:35| And the only way they can grow is by figuring out a way these kids can be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15875)|
| 4:24:39| in these rural community areas to learn something else besides TVs and iPods and iPads to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15879)|
| 4:24:45| Let them get down in the area and find the crawl daddies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15885)|
| 4:24:48| or let them get out and learn to grow and do some gardening and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15888)|
| 4:24:51| Maybe they won't all go to college, and it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15891)|
| 4:24:54| But give these kids the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15894)|
| 4:24:56| TWRA has plans and grants where they'll buy plants for them to be having things under the towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15896)|
| 4:25:02| After-school programs and government programs are available through even the Freedom Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15902)|
| 4:25:08| I'm sorry, but please help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15908)|
| 4:25:10| I usually get five minutes, and I think you've probably hit your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15910)|
| 4:25:14| Everyone else left. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15914)|
| 4:25:15| All right. That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15915)|
| 4:25:16| I still am not. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15916)|
| 4:25:18| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15918)|
| 4:25:20| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15920)|
| 4:25:22| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15922)|
| 4:25:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15923)|
| 4:25:24| I wanted to kind of address the previous speaker, because she's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15924)|
| 4:25:28| There is a perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15928)|
| 4:25:29| And part of that problem, I believe, derives from the fact that we're working off a plan that's outdated and outmoded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15929)|
| 4:25:37| And there are times that things happen that don't exactly look smooth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15937)|
| 4:25:42| but it's the way we have to work around things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15942)|
| 4:25:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15948)|
| 4:25:50| To get back to what I'd like to do is, as chair, I want to review what I said at the beginning of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15950)|
| 4:26:01| Frankly, I'm glad I put this on the agenda to get this discussion going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15961)|
| 4:26:07| And if this is what it's taken to get all this debate that we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15967)|
| 4:26:15| frankly, over the last 20 years, it's never happened because it's never actually been pushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15975)|
| 4:26:19| And just putting this out there is a good step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15979)|
| 4:26:24| I've been all over the board on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15984)|
| 4:26:27| I've listened. I've looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15987)|
| 4:26:31| I guess one thing that has been a bigger influence on me, and to all of the public who are here, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15991)|
| 4:26:38| But actually, I go back to the last week's meeting when we had a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=15998)|
| 4:26:43| For those of you who weren't here the Monday before this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16003)|
| 4:26:46| we have a little bit more relaxed meeting where we discuss the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16006)|
| 4:26:50| And the one thing I heard from all of our commissioners is a desire to do planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16010)|
| 4:26:56| And I want to make sure that's clear and that everybody understands it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16016)|
| 4:27:01| And that, to me, was the most important thing I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16021)|
| 4:27:05| I know we've heard a lot from the community, a lot of e-mails and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16025)|
| 4:27:08| but that's always been the most important thing for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16028)|
| 4:27:11| I guess where we've come right now, I have no problem trying to put a resolution with my name on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16031)|
| 4:27:21| requesting to bring the team together to do this planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16041)|
| 4:27:28| And it's mainly because we have never actually pushed it to get the city to come to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16048)|
| 4:27:36| Because I've got to tell you all, it's frustrating as H-E double hockey sticks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16056)|
| 4:27:40| when we cannot, will not, could not get this plan developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16060)|
| 4:27:47| And I've heard from a lot of developers who are frustrated and want to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16067)|
| 4:27:54| So that is something I guess what I would say is that I've come around on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16074)|
| 4:28:00| and I'm comfortable with it just because I think that for me it's the right thing to do right at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16080)|
| 4:28:10| Are we going to send a mixed message to our legislature? Yeah, possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16090)|
| 4:28:13| And Commissioner Anders has got a point that if we need to have a stopgap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16093)|
| 4:28:17| But right now, the fact that we've never formally asked the city of Knoxville to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16097)|
| 4:28:22| and the fact that the town of Farragut was here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16102)|
| 4:28:24| and those have always been the two things that have prevented this more than anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16104)|
| 4:28:29| It's kind of point of order. We've got our discussion stopped, so let's call for a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16109)|
| 4:28:36| All right, I'll go back to the chair. Commissioner Busler's light was on earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16116)|
| 4:28:40| but I used my chairman's discretion to make a statement. So go ahead, Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16120)|
| 4:28:46| I want to call a point of order. I called for a question some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16126)|
| 4:28:49| Nobody's light was on and the discussion kept going. So let's vote on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16129)|
| 4:28:54| Now, what are we going to vote on right now? Are we going to vote to stop the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16134)|
| 4:28:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16139)|
| 4:29:02| All right, where are we on the motion and the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16142)|
| 4:29:07| All right, let's vote on Commissioner Busler's question call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16147)|
| 4:29:11| As chair, I apologize if I did not see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16151)|
| 4:29:14| Mr. Chairman, to your defense, you were speaking when he called for a point of order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16154)|
| 4:29:20| so you have the right to finish your speech before he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16160)|
| 4:29:24| I understand, and that's why I kept talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16164)|
| 4:29:28| So what I'd like to do is, let's go ahead. Now, back to Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16168)|
| 4:29:35| I'll recognize that you've called the question, so the vote at hand is if you vote yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16175)|
| 4:29:41| you'd like to see discussion stop and then vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16181)|
| 4:29:45| If you vote no, then you would like to continue discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16185)|
| 4:29:50| But I also want to clarify the motion that is on the table we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16190)|
| 4:29:55| Let's get a restatement of the motion that's on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16195)|
| 4:29:59| The motion is to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16199)|
| 4:30:01| We need to vote on the call for question and then get into that, otherwise you'll confuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16201)|
| 4:30:04| Yeah, I know. That's why I keep trying to restate everything, because we've been all over the place on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16204)|
| 4:30:08| So let's go ahead. The Chair will call for a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16208)|
| 4:30:13| Once again, if you vote yes, you would like discussion to cease and have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16213)|
| 4:30:19| And if you vote no, Mr. Law Director, what's the preference on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16219)|
| 4:30:27| I can probably, yeah, it's up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16227)|
| 4:30:30| I'll go ahead and have a roll call vote to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16230)|
| 4:30:36| Commissioner Anders? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16236)|
| 4:30:38| Commissioner Anders votes aye. Commissioner Bessler? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16238)|
| 4:30:41| Commissioner Bessler votes aye. Commissioner Beeler? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16241)|
| 4:30:44| Commissioner Beeler votes aye. Commissioner Daly? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16244)|
| 4:30:47| Commissioner Daly votes aye. Commissioner Jay is out. Commissioner Biggs? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16247)|
| 4:30:51| Commissioner Biggs votes aye. Commissioner Gill? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16251)|
| 4:30:55| Commissioner Gill votes aye. Commissioner Carringer? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16255)|
| 4:30:57| Commissioner Carringer votes aye. Commissioner Smith? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16257)|
| 4:31:00| Commissioner Smith votes aye. Commissioner Nystrom? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16260)|
| 4:31:03| Commissioner Nystrom? Aye. Commissioner Nystrom votes aye. Commissioner Schoonmaker? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16263)|
| 4:31:06| Commissioner Schoonmaker votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16266)|
| 4:31:09| Okay, now the motion that was on the table, I'd like to review the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16269)|
| 4:31:14| Where are we on the substitute motion? Which motion was on the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16274)|
| 4:31:17| To approve as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16277)|
| 4:31:20| Okay, the motion on the table is to go back to the original resolution that was originally presented in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16280)|
| 4:31:27| His is the original, his is the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16287)|
| 4:31:30| It's the original caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16290)|
| 4:31:33| If you want number 35 to go forward, you go yes, if you don't, you vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16293)|
| 4:31:37| So, to clarify, yeah, but the substitute motion was to get back to the original motion, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16297)|
| 4:31:44| Original caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16304)|
| 4:31:46| Original caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16306)|
| 4:31:47| Resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16307)|
| 4:31:48| Original resolution as written, that is in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16308)|
| 4:31:51| We are voting on the original resolution as written, item 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16311)|
| 4:32:00| Can I ask a question of the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16320)|
| 4:32:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16322)|
| 4:32:03| If this fails, can I restate my substitute motion? Is it get and get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16323)|
| 4:32:10| If this motion fails, it falls back to the motion from Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16330)|
| 4:32:16| But I can substitute that with the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16336)|
| 4:32:18| You can substitute another motion if you get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16338)|
| 4:32:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16340)|
| 4:32:24| Okay, the motion on the table is the original caption as in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16344)|
| 4:32:32| We'll begin this with a, if it doesn't sound clear, I will call for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16352)|
| 4:32:38| All in favor of that motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16358)|
| 4:32:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16361)|
| 4:32:42| All opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16362)|
| 4:32:44| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16364)|
| 4:32:45| Okay, it does not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16365)|
| 4:32:49| I'm going to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16369)|
| 4:32:51| All right, Commissioner Anders, it's recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16371)|
| 4:32:54| I'd like to make a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16374)|
| 4:32:56| It was Randy voted no and the rest of us voted, or yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16376)|
| 4:33:00| He voted aye and everybody voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16380)|
| 4:33:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16382)|
| 4:33:03| I'd like to make a substitute motion, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16383)|
| 4:33:06| And it basically restates my previous motion where we take a dual track on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16386)|
| 4:33:14| as Commissioner Schoonmaker would like to ask the mayor to reconvene the urban or the growth boundary group as stated in TCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16394)|
| 4:33:23| If after at some point where they say that they do not want or if they choose not to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16403)|
| 4:33:32| then we go ask the legislature to exempt Knox County from the update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16412)|
| 4:33:39| and establish our own general plan, funding the MPC's request to redo the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16419)|
| 4:33:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16429)|
| 4:33:50| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16430)|
| 4:33:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16432)|
| 4:33:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16433)|
| 4:33:54| There is a proper second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16434)|
| 4:33:57| The original motion was from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16437)|
| 4:33:59| The second is by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16439)|
| 4:34:01| Now we have time for proper debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16441)|
| 4:34:04| I'm recognizing Commissioner Gill and then I will call on Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16444)|
| 4:34:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16449)|
| 4:34:10| This was just a procedural question because once the substitute motion failed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16450)|
| 4:34:17| you return to the original motion made by Commissioner Schoonmaker, not allow that motion to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16457)|
| 4:34:27| And I just need to make sure that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16467)|
| 4:34:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16469)|
| 4:34:30| Let's verify that from the lottery director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16470)|
| 4:34:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16474)|
| 4:34:35| Would you restate your question, please, Commissioner Gill, to the law department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16475)|
| 4:34:39| Is that a valid motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16479)|
| 4:34:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16481)|
| 4:34:42| Is that a valid motion when you had an approved substitute motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16482)|
| 4:34:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16487)|
| 4:34:48| I think you can have one substitute motion at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16488)|
| 4:34:51| Bud, could you speak up a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16491)|
| 4:34:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16493)|
| 4:34:54| I think you can have one substitute motion at a time and you have the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16494)|
| 4:34:59| So you have a substitute motion and that substitute motion fails, you fall back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16499)|
| 4:35:05| But then you can have another substitute motion for the original motion if the body so desires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16505)|
| 4:35:12| If they don't, you vote on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16512)|
| 4:35:15| If it fails, then you have to have another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16515)|
| 4:35:19| So we don't go back to the substitute motion that actually we were going to take a vote on, which was John Schoonmaker's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16519)|
| 4:35:25| It does go back to his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16525)|
| 4:35:27| His was the main motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16527)|
| 4:35:29| And so you can have a substitute motion to the main motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16529)|
| 4:35:33| If we don't have that, I mean, you can't have two substitutes on top of a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16533)|
| 4:35:38| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16538)|
| 4:35:39| But when it goes back to the main motion, you can't have a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16539)|
| 4:35:42| And that's what you have before you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16542)|
| 4:35:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16544)|
| 4:35:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16545)|
| 4:35:46| Commissioner Anders had made a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16546)|
| 4:35:51| I guess what I want to go back to, Mr. Law Director, is to clarify, based on that question, where exactly are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16551)|
| 4:35:57| Are we back to the original motion that Commissioner Schoonmaker brought up, or now we're back to the substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16557)|
| 4:36:05| When the substitute motion failed, it went to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16565)|
| 4:36:09| However, you had another substitute motion which was seconded, which takes place at the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16569)|
| 4:36:16| So that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16576)|
| 4:36:17| Now you vote on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16577)|
| 4:36:19| If it fails, it falls back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16579)|
| 4:36:22| If you have no more substitute motions or a call for the question, you vote on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16582)|
| 4:36:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16589)|
| 4:36:32| I noticed that Commissioner Biggs' light came on during that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16592)|
| 4:36:35| I want to restate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16595)|
| 4:36:37| So if I'm clear, what is on the table right now is the substitute motion from Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16597)|
| 4:36:42| which was to follow the Schoonmaker original, and I'm restating, it said do the original motion by Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16602)|
| 4:36:50| but add in the caveat where if it doesn't pass, I want to repeat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16610)|
| 4:36:56| Could you repeat it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16616)|
| 4:36:57| Clerk, can you repeat it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16617)|
| 4:36:59| Brad, if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16619)|
| 4:37:01| I just want to make sure, and this has been a long night, I get it, I want to thank everybody for their patience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16621)|
| 4:37:06| but I'd rather, this is too important not to get right and make sure everybody knows what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16626)|
| 4:37:11| So I'm going to err towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16631)|
| 4:37:13| The substitute motion is to initiate the process that Commissioner Schoonmaker has asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16633)|
| 4:37:19| with the mayor's office convening the growth plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16639)|
| 4:37:24| If it fails to come to fruition, we ask the legislature to hold a place for allowing us to develop our own plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16644)|
| 4:37:37| and replace the urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16657)|
| 4:37:39| With a new general plan, we ask MPC to start the process, and we fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16659)|
| 4:37:47| And that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16667)|
| 4:37:49| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16669)|
| 4:37:50| And he has restated the motion, and I'm going to restate it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16670)|
| 4:37:54| It goes back to the original motion that Commissioner Schoonmaker had made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16674)|
| 4:37:59| but it's added in that if the other parties do not come to the table, so to speak, to update the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16679)|
| 4:38:06| that it leaves the option to go back to the state legislature to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16686)|
| 4:38:14| I'm going to call on you, John, because you made that original motion that this was based on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16694)|
| 4:38:20| and you were part of this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16700)|
| 4:38:22| No, but in my original motion, I did include withdrawing Resolution R-19-1-whatever it was, number 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16702)|
| 4:38:34| Well, yeah, because Commissioner Anderson said he had referenced yours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16714)|
| 4:38:38| so that's why we need to get a restatement of yours as it relates to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16718)|
| 4:38:42| So yours was to ask for the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16722)|
| 4:38:45| My motion was to ask the chairman of the Knox County Commission to notify the Knox County mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16725)|
| 4:38:52| and the mayor of the city of Knoxville and the mayor of the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16732)|
| 4:38:57| to call the Growth Policy Coordinating Committee into session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16737)|
| 4:39:03| and at the same time withdraw Resolution R-19-1-907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16743)|
| 4:39:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16753)|
| 4:39:14| And my motion does not withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16754)|
| 4:39:15| It keeps a placeholder with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16755)|
| 4:39:17| We've shown a good-faith effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16757)|
| 4:39:19| If that good-faith effort is not responded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16759)|
| 4:39:22| we go forward with the legislation toward the end of the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16762)|
| 4:39:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16767)|
| 4:39:28| So that's actually a separate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16768)|
| 4:39:31| You just want to be really clear, and I'm sorry for being so anal on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16771)|
| 4:39:35| but Johns had said you eliminate the original one as here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16775)|
| 4:39:41| Brad has said that you include that in there, and that is what we have before us now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16781)|
| 4:39:48| is basically the original intent for the chair commission to send notes to the municipalities to convene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16788)|
| 4:39:58| and Brad has added to that, if they do not convene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16798)|
| 4:40:04| to continue to authorize the legislature to pass a bill authorizing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16804)|
| 4:40:10| Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16810)|
| 4:40:11| Is that where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16811)|
| 4:40:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16813)|
| 4:40:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16814)|
| 4:40:15| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16815)|
| 4:40:17| My question is actually for Commissioner Anders, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16817)|
| 4:40:22| So in your secondary motion, does this mean that it would keep the city from expanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16822)|
| 4:40:30| It has nothing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16830)|
| 4:40:32| The city can't expand without following the law that TCA has set forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16832)|
| 4:40:36| This really has nothing to do with expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16836)|
| 4:40:38| This is all about updating the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16838)|
| 4:40:40| And so it doesn't keep the city from expanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16840)|
| 4:40:43| TCA already does that, and they have a guide to follow for that expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16843)|
| 4:40:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16847)|
| 4:40:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16848)|
| 4:40:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16850)|
| 4:40:51| I think it was Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16851)|
| 4:40:53| I've gone back and forth, but I'll go ahead and call on Commissioner Daly, then Smith, and then Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16853)|
| 4:40:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16859)|
| 4:41:01| I will be voting no on this for the simple reason that we have not demonstrated the effort to the Town Affair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16861)|
| 4:41:11| to see it in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16871)|
| 4:41:12| If this goes to a resolution, it goes to the state government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16872)|
| 4:41:16| if a state legislature is down there smart enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16876)|
| 4:41:18| they're going to ask, well, what have you all done for the last five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16878)|
| 4:41:21| Have you tried to convene?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16881)|
| 4:41:22| Did you follow the state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16882)|
| 4:41:24| And the answer is, no, we've not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16884)|
| 4:41:28| So I'm afraid that we get down there and we pass a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16888)|
| 4:41:32| and that it says that we won't see Knoxville not wanting to cooperate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16892)|
| 4:41:37| Well, they're not cooperating because we've never done what the law says that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16897)|
| 4:41:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16903)|
| 4:41:44| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16904)|
| 4:41:45| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16905)|
| 4:41:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16907)|
| 4:41:49| I think I will be supporting the substitute motion for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16909)|
| 4:41:53| One, it does exactly what John says, and that's what the people have asked us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16913)|
| 4:41:57| And two, I think we have agreement maybe from the people and the rest of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16917)|
| 4:42:03| that if the parties aren't able to come together, that is our only choice moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16923)|
| 4:42:09| And it may be that in 60 days it's too late to do anything in this legislative session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16929)|
| 4:42:14| but we will have a desired and an acknowledged direction that we're going to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16934)|
| 4:42:21| and it can stop us from being back here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16941)|
| 4:42:25| It gets us on the right footing to go into next year's legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16945)|
| 4:42:30| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16950)|
| 4:42:32| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16952)|
| 4:42:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16953)|
| 4:42:34| When you put a bill before and try to get it on the legislative docket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16954)|
| 4:42:39| there's a process that you go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16959)|
| 4:42:41| and each legislator down there has so many bills that they want to put on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16961)|
| 4:42:47| And I'm not sure that we can get somebody to put a blank bill space on there for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16967)|
| 4:42:56| I don't know if they would hold an open space for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16976)|
| 4:43:00| And I don't even know if anybody's been down there to watch how these things go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16980)|
| 4:43:08| Again, we can try to do it, but I don't know if it would even be feasible for them to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16988)|
| 4:43:15| I'm going to hold one of my bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16995)|
| 4:43:17| And each one of them has a number that they can pass in the House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=16997)|
| 4:43:22| And if you don't believe that, go ask them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17002)|
| 4:43:24| because they have to go to somebody else to ask for permission to use one of their places for a bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17004)|
| 4:43:30| So, you know, we're asking them to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17010)|
| 4:43:33| And take this blank and hold it here until we do this for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17013)|
| 4:43:38| And I'm not sure that that's going to fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17018)|
| 4:43:42| So, anyway, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17022)|
| 4:43:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17025)|
| 4:43:47| Thank you, Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17027)|
| 4:43:48| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17028)|
| 4:43:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17030)|
| 4:43:52| I agree with Commissioner Daley's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17032)|
| 4:43:55| I'm going to vote no on the substitute motion, because I think we need to do it like he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17035)|
| 4:44:02| We need to do it locally first and get that handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17042)|
| 4:44:05| And then, if need be, then go to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17045)|
| 4:44:09| But that really wasn't what my motion was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17049)|
| 4:44:12| That was only half of my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17052)|
| 4:44:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17054)|
| 4:44:15| So my motion, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17055)|
| 4:44:17| I think the other half matters now that it failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17057)|
| 4:44:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17060)|
| 4:44:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17061)|
| 4:44:22| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17062)|
| 4:44:23| I've got a question for Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17063)|
| 4:44:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17067)|
| 4:44:28| Director Green, with the city going through recode in Knoxville, might they be at a point of fatigue when we come asking for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17068)|
| 4:44:36| I don't see why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17076)|
| 4:44:38| I think they're actually probably in a pretty good place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17078)|
| 4:44:41| And the recode is to do much more than you said bringing density to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17081)|
| 4:44:47| There are a lot of standards in the city of Knoxville, as in Knox County, out of date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17087)|
| 4:44:52| So I think they would be in a good position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17092)|
| 4:44:56| The communication among the various city departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17096)|
| 4:44:59| We've got the organization set up with the communities in the city that we can follow in the county to get the community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17099)|
| 4:45:05| Commissioner Busler has said it's so important, and the rest of you, that I think we're in a good position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17105)|
| 4:45:12| We've learned a lot from recode to move into this and would have the ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17112)|
| 4:45:18| And also, we at staff know how to better work with consultants now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17118)|
| 4:45:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17123)|
| 4:45:27| I was going to call for a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17127)|
| 4:45:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17129)|
| 4:45:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17130)|
| 4:45:31| There's a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17131)|
| 4:45:32| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17132)|
| 4:45:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17133)|
| 4:45:34| Because as we are fond of saying, no matter where you are in the city of Knoxville, you're always in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17134)|
| 4:45:39| It is time to build an appropriate plan with stakeholders and constituent inputs in order to build a vision for this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17139)|
| 4:45:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17150)|
| 4:45:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17151)|
| 4:45:52| Commissioner Carringer has called for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17152)|
| 4:45:59| I've got people whispering all over the place here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17159)|
| 4:46:03| Commissioner Carringer has called for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17163)|
| 4:46:06| When a question is called, I want to restate, if you wish to continue debate on this matter, vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17166)|
| 4:46:12| If you would like to cease debate, vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17172)|
| 4:46:18| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17178)|
| 4:46:19| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17179)|
| 4:46:20| It's been a long night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17180)|
| 4:46:21| Janice, you know how these meetings go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17181)|
| 4:46:24| So if you'd like to continue debate, you'd like to cease debate, vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17184)|
| 4:46:33| If you'd like to continue debate, vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17193)|
| 4:46:36| So to cease debate, vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17196)|
| 4:46:40| Voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17200)|
| 4:46:41| Voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17201)|
| 4:46:43| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17203)|
| 4:46:46| All in favor of ceasing debate, please vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17206)|
| 4:46:51| Please vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17211)|
| 4:46:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17212)|
| 4:46:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17213)|
| 4:46:54| All opposed to ceasing debate, vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17214)|
| 4:47:01| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17221)|
| 4:47:02| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17222)|
| 4:47:03| Now we're going to have a roll call on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17223)|
| 4:47:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17226)|
| 4:47:08| The substitute motion that is on the table I want to go back to is Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17228)|
| 4:47:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17234)|
| 4:47:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17235)|
| 4:47:16| Which, to restate that specifically what we're voting on, that was to have the mayors have a note from the Chairman of County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17236)|
| 4:47:25| to reconvene the committee to update the growth plan to, I assume, recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17245)|
| 4:47:33| did that include appropriate, adequate funding for MPC to update the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17253)|
| 4:47:39| and to have as a backstop in the event that this does not, the committee does not reconvene that, could you restate exactly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17259)|
| 4:47:55| If the committee does not convene, we ask the legislator to have a placeholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17275)|
| 4:47:58| If they so choose to allow us to modify our own growth plan or eliminate us from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17278)|
| 4:48:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17283)|
| 4:48:04| What he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17284)|
| 4:48:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17285)|
| 4:48:07| Is everybody clear on what you're voting for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17287)|
| 4:48:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17289)|
| 4:48:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17290)|
| 4:48:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17291)|
| 4:48:12| Is everybody clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17292)|
| 4:48:13| So we'll do a roll call vote on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17293)|
| 4:48:18| Commissioner Bessler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17298)|

| 4:48:41| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17321)|

| 4:48:50| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17330)|
| 4:48:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17331)|

| 4:48:54| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17334)|
| 4:48:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17335)|
| 4:48:56| Commissioner Anders votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17336)|
| 4:48:57| Does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17337)|
| 4:49:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17340)|
| 4:49:01| Does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17341)|
| 4:49:04| I vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17344)|
| 4:49:06| Commissioner Beeler votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17346)|
| 4:49:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17348)|
| 4:49:09| Too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17349)|
| 4:49:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17350)|
| 4:49:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17351)|
| 4:49:12| That puts us back on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17352)|
| 4:49:15| We still are dealing with item number 35 on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17355)|
| 4:49:20| I think we're going back to the original substitute motion that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17360)|
| 4:49:25| The original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17365)|
| 4:49:26| The original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17366)|
| 4:49:27| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17367)|
| 4:49:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17368)|
| 4:49:29| The original motion from Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17369)|
| 4:49:31| Commissioner Schoonmaker, will you please restate that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17371)|
| 4:49:36| I make a motion that the Chairman of the Knox County Commission notify the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17376)|
| 4:49:43| Knox County Mayor, the City of Knoxville Mayor, and the Town of Farragut Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17383)|
| 4:49:48| to reinstitute the Growth Policy Coordinating Committee and at the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17388)|
| 4:49:54| time to withdraw Resolution R-19-1-907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17394)|
| 4:49:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17399)|
| 4:50:00| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17400)|
| 4:50:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17401)|
| 4:50:02| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17402)|
| 4:50:03| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17403)|
| 4:50:04| Does it need to be withdrawn if it's already failed as a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17404)|
| 4:50:08| It's not failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17408)|
| 4:50:10| You've got an original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17410)|
| 4:50:12| It's not failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17412)|
| 4:50:13| I'm just saying withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17413)|
| 4:50:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17416)|
| 4:50:17| Mr. Law Director, just a point of clarification for the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17417)|
| 4:50:22| The point of order that Commissioner Smith asked was the original caption in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17422)|
| 4:50:27| If that needs to be voted on or passed or non-passed versus Commissioner Schoonmaker's motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17427)|
| 4:50:33| included passing an alternative to that and that original caption being withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17433)|
| 4:50:40| My question to the Law Department is with the motion that Commissioner Schoonmaker has made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17440)|
| 4:50:45| would that suffice rather than needing to have a vote on Item 35 as presently written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17445)|
| 4:50:53| That was the point of order from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17453)|
| 4:50:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17455)|
| 4:50:56| Commissioner Schoonmaker's motion is to call and convene the Committee for the Urban Growth Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17456)|
| 4:51:04| That in itself, if passed, will defeat the original resolution on its face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17464)|
| 4:51:11| So you can either include it or not include it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17471)|
| 4:51:14| But if this motion passes, it is the motion in place of the current legislation proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17474)|
| 4:51:23| And it's the original motion made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17483)|
| 4:51:25| Nobody made a motion until later as a substitute motion to pass the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17485)|
| 4:51:31| So before you, if you vote in favor of this resolution, the written resolution is moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17491)|
| 4:51:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17500)|
| 4:51:41| Do I need to amend my?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17501)|
| 4:51:42| It does the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17502)|
| 4:51:44| I think it stands the way you stated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17504)|
| 4:51:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17507)|
| 4:51:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17508)|
| 4:51:49| So the motion has been made by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17509)|
| 4:51:51| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17511)|
| 4:51:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17512)|
| 4:51:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17513)|
| 4:51:54| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17514)|
| 4:51:55| It's on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17515)|
| 4:51:56| So we're back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17516)|
| 4:51:57| We've restated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17517)|
| 4:51:58| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17518)|
| 4:51:59| I've drank three cups of coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17519)|
| 4:52:00| I'm trying to keep it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17520)|
| 4:52:01| And I usually drink a Red Bull, which is what I had last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17521)|
| 4:52:03| So I'm a little off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17523)|
| 4:52:06| But we have a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17526)|
| 4:52:09| Before we have the vote, we now have discussion on this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17529)|
| 4:52:12| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17532)|
| 4:52:14| Wouldn't this be a bad time to make a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17534)|
| 4:52:18| Let's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17538)|
| 4:52:25| It depends if you want to walk out of here, Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17545)|
| 4:52:28| Oh, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17548)|
| 4:52:29| You guys are funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17549)|
| 4:52:30| You're killing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17550)|
| 4:52:31| So that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17551)|
| 4:52:33| What the chair would like to do is all in favor of Commissioner Schoonmaker's motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17553)|
| 4:52:39| which has been restated countless times, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17559)|
| 4:52:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17564)|

| 4:52:46| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17566)|
| 4:52:50| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17570)|
| 4:52:52| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17572)|
| 4:52:56| Now the work's up to you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17576)|
| 4:53:03| You still don't have the funding for your plan, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17583)|
| 4:53:06| You didn't include it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17586)|
| 4:53:09| Bring it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17589)|
| 4:53:11| This is just a coordinating committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17591)|
| 4:53:13| It doesn't require funds at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17593)|
| 4:53:15| How about your general plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17595)|
| 4:53:25| What we need to do, we do have the regular consent agenda that needs to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17605)|
| 4:53:28| I'm going to ask Madam Clerk, who's been trying to keep this thing straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17608)|
| 4:53:30| So what I'm going to do is lean on Madam Clerk now that we've got out of 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17610)|
| 4:53:35| Where are we on the items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17615)|
| 4:53:37| Page 2 on Drives and Roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17617)|
| 4:53:40| To approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17620)|
| 4:53:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17621)|
| 4:53:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17622)|
| 4:53:43| A proper motion has been made by Commissioner Anders and seconded by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17623)|
| 4:53:46| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17626)|
| 4:53:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17628)|
| 4:53:49| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17629)|
| 4:53:50| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17630)|
| 4:53:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17631)|
| 4:53:52| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17632)|
| 4:53:53| Line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17633)|
| 4:53:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17636)|
| 4:53:57| Is there a motion for approval of the line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17637)|
| 4:54:03| A motion has been made by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17643)|
| 4:54:06| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17646)|
| 4:54:07| I believe, was that Evelyn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17647)|
| 4:54:08| Was that you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17648)|
| 4:54:09| And there's a second from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17649)|
| 4:54:11| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17651)|
| 4:54:14| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17654)|
| 4:54:16| Commissioner Jay's not here, so I really don't feel good about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17656)|
| 4:54:21| I prefer putting this off until he's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17661)|
| 4:54:24| Or in the meantime, I'd like to make a substitute motion to fund the design phase but not the acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17664)|
| 4:54:34| The engineering and design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17674)|
| 4:54:37| Not the acquisition or right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17677)|
| 4:54:39| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17679)|
| 4:54:40| Because I think eventually we will be able to get to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17680)|
| 4:54:43| And it wouldn't hurt to already have the design done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17683)|
| 4:54:45| But I don't see spending money on right away until we're ready to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17685)|
| 4:54:49| I'll ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17689)|
| 4:54:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17691)|
| 4:54:52| Let me restate what you've said going back on our past history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17692)|
| 4:54:55| The question was there was a line item transfer in here related specifically to all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17695)|
| 4:55:01| Your request or the motion is I think to fund approximately half of that appropriation, which was the part to just do the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17701)|
| 4:55:11| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17711)|
| 4:55:15| Chris has done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17715)|
| 4:55:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17716)|
| 4:55:17| Chris, do you know this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17717)|
| 4:55:27| Design would be $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17727)|
| 4:55:28| It's like $95, so we'd round up to $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17728)|
| 4:55:32| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17732)|
| 4:55:34| Design would be, it's like $95, so we'd round to $100 just to be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17734)|
| 4:55:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17738)|
| 4:55:39| So I think if you want to amend that line item to just do $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17739)|
| 4:55:43| I'd like to amend my motion to pass the line item transfer with the amendment to funding $100,000 towards design on the Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17743)|
| 4:55:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17752)|
| 4:55:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17753)|
| 4:55:54| The motion to amend this line item has been made by Commissioner Smith, and a second has been made by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17754)|
| 4:56:01| Is there, and I see a discussion light on from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17761)|
| 4:56:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17765)|
| 4:56:06| I was going to ask where would the money be allocated from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17766)|
| 4:56:11| I see I missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17771)|
| 4:56:14| It was capital from BHUC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17774)|
| 4:56:16| The Behavioral Health Care Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17776)|
| 4:56:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17781)|
| 4:56:22| Go ahead, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17782)|
| 4:56:24| What Brad said is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17784)|
| 4:56:25| So we had savings from the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Project that we did because the state's funding covered more of the capital than we anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17785)|
| 4:56:35| So that's where it would come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17795)|
| 4:56:38| Thank you, Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17798)|
| 4:56:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17799)|
| 4:56:40| Now, is there any other discussion on this item before we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17800)|
| 4:56:43| I see Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17803)|
| 4:56:44| Mr. Caldwell, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17804)|
| 4:56:47| I think you said last week there was a deadline on this amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17807)|
| 4:56:52| This is a state grant, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17812)|
| 4:56:55| Do we have a timeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17815)|
| 4:56:57| It's not a state grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17817)|
| 4:56:59| He said there was a spend down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17819)|
| 4:57:01| I don't know that there was a timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17821)|
| 4:57:02| I said we have spend down requirements on bond dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17822)|
| 4:57:05| So we can't just hold bond dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17825)|
| 4:57:09| So that's why not spending the money can potentially put us in harm's way by not spending down our bond dollars timely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17829)|
| 4:57:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17840)|
| 4:57:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17842)|
| 4:57:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17843)|
| 4:57:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17844)|
| 4:57:25| This motion, seeing no other lights for discussion, this motion regarding the line items is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=17845)|
