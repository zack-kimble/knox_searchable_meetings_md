| 5:49:34| Anyone that's in the business developing affordable housing knows that these deals die a thousand deaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20974)|
| 5:49:41| This one, like most, has died several times and hard work has kept resuscitating it and kept it alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20981)|
| 5:49:49| So these funds are critical to the whole funding package, which is 13 different sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20989)|
| 5:49:56| It's a very complex deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20996)|
| 5:49:58| But that's all I need to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20998)|
| 5:50:03| It is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21003)|
| 5:50:04| Yeah, and I do agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21004)|
| 5:50:07| county commission and city council are coming together for a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21007)|
| 5:50:10| It's a pretty big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21010)|
| 5:50:12| It's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21012)|
| 5:50:13| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21013)|
| 5:50:14| I think it's showing the commitment on both bodies to do what's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21014)|
| 5:50:18| and to get all the information before we make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21018)|
| 5:50:22| So I guess with that, and I touched on this during intergovernmental, this question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21022)|
| 5:50:31| In terms of what I guess I thought was amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21031)|
| 5:50:38| was your ruling recommending a veto by the mayor about the public funding portion of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21038)|
| 5:50:48| or did you take from this body that we wanted to just flat out restrict housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21048)|
| 5:50:59| supportive housing in this two-mile radius| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21059)|
| 5:51:01| or was it the fact that there was public funding for this public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21061)|
| 5:51:05| even if not the county, there would be public funding for this two-mile radius?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21065)|
| 5:51:09| My recommendation was that the amendment attached strings to the proposal that, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21069)|
| 5:51:18| violated the fair, the strings violated the Fair Housing Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21078)|
| 5:51:24| Okay, so any type of, I guess all the precedent that I've looked at has provided by you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21084)|
| 5:51:36| and Commissioner Harmon has just really kind of straight you can't build here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21096)|
| 5:51:41| not you can't have public dollars to build here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21101)|
| 5:51:45| Are there any cases out there that were ruled unfavorable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21105)|
| 5:51:51| that said withholding public funds constitute a violation of the Fair Housing Act?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21111)|
| 5:51:59| The Fair Housing Act doesn't limit itself to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21119)|
| 5:52:05| It doesn't limit itself to a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21125)|
| 5:52:11| It has a broad prohibition on discrimination, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21131)|
| 5:52:18| It prohibits discrimination based on things that are enumerated in the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21138)|
| 5:52:26| And there are three theories that plaintiffs typically use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21146)|
| 5:52:32| and they are direct action, disparate impact, and failure to accommodate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21152)|
| 5:52:40| And in this instance, it was my opinion that this provision would have at a minimum a disparate impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21160)|
| 5:52:51| and could very likely be a direct violation of the Fair Housing Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21171)|
| 5:52:57| You and I had a discussion the last time about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21177)|
| 5:53:00| Right, some of the other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21180)|
| 5:53:01| But when you cut down to it, to be blunt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21181)|
| 5:53:07| aren't those really discriminatory type things where people didn't want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21187)|
| 5:53:12| they had a more affluent type area where they didn't want this type housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21192)|
| 5:53:19| To me, we've had an overabundance of this type housing in this two-mile radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21199)|
| 5:53:26| probably three-mile radius, and we weren't not wanting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21206)|
| 5:53:30| Actually, the Tracy P case that I just alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21210)|
| 5:53:35| that Commissioner Harmon cited in the materials that he posted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21215)|
| 5:53:41| that case was one where there was already existing housing in Sarasota County, Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21221)|
| 5:53:50| And those who were operating it had asked that their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21230)|
| 5:53:56| actually the residents, just like in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21236)|
| 5:54:03| and the reason I think that case is important is because you had the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21243)|
| 5:54:09| come forward to one of their commissioners, and this was discussed in the court's opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21249)|
| 5:54:14| came to their commissioner and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21254)|
| 5:54:16| we don't want any change in zoning that would allow any expansion of these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21256)|
| 5:54:24| Evidently, it was contemplation that it would be expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21264)|
| 5:54:28| And the community came to the commissioner and asked that that commissioner take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21268)|
| 5:54:36| What Sarasota County tried to do was change the classification of the housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21276)|
| 5:54:43| so that it would run afoul of existing zoning if it was expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21283)|
| 5:54:50| And they were, Sarasota County was sued by the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21290)|
| 5:54:55| They were sued by the United States Department of Justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21295)|
| 5:55:00| And as I said earlier, when the county filed a motion to try to get the case against them dismissed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21300)|
| 5:55:09| and they ended up having to pay $750,000, the housing remained in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21309)|
| 5:55:17| and they had to take training on how to not violate the Fair Housing Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21317)|
| 5:55:25| And I'll make this my final statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21325)|
| 5:55:27| I think Sarasota County is a fairly affluent county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21327)|
| 5:55:32| Like I said, this housing was already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21332)|
| 5:55:37| Again, Ms. Rowe, I don't want to reach the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21337)|
| 5:55:42| I don't want to rehash our whole very interesting conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21342)|
| 5:55:46| But, I mean, there is a legitimate question as to whether a provision of the contract is the same as zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21346)|
| 5:55:53| There is a legitimate disagreement as to whether homelessness is considered a disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21353)|
| 5:56:00| As a matter of fact, I decided to use some case law hemisphere that suggests that it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21360)|
| 5:56:05| But regardless of that, I mean, that's not really before us now because the amendment isn't in the version before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21365)|
| 5:56:12| What's before us is a motion to pass it as originally presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21372)|
| 5:56:16| As a courtesy to my colleague, who is hospitalized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21376)|
| 5:56:19| and who works so diligently to look at this issue and to work with her neighborhood associations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21379)|
| 5:56:24| and to be online with her online communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21384)|
| 5:56:27| it would be a disservice to her to at least not postpone it one month, if not two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21387)|
| 5:56:33| She has done all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21393)|
| 5:56:34| I have looked into the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21394)|
| 5:56:35| We have, as a team, tried to do what's responsible for our community in terms of homeless services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21395)|
| 5:56:41| but at the same time not clustering them in one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21401)|
| 5:56:44| And if Mr. Lawler is not ready to extend even the courtesy of one month to those of us who have worked diligently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21404)|
| 5:56:51| trying to get good answers for the community, then this should be voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21411)|
| 5:56:57| Could I speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21417)|
| 5:56:58| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21418)|
| 5:56:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21419)|
| 5:57:00| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21420)|
| 5:57:01| First, and I look forward to our workshop because it will give us all better clarity on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21421)|
| 5:57:08| permanent supportive housing is for chronically homeless individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21428)|
| 5:57:12| The Department of Housing and Urban Development defines a chronically homeless individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21432)|
| 5:57:16| as a disabled individual who has been homeless for more than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21436)|
| 5:57:22| Are you familiar with the hemisphere case that says that persons who are disabled because of their disability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21442)|
| 5:57:29| or because of any monetary considerations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21449)|
| 5:57:31| Are you familiar with that western hemisphere case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21451)|
| 5:57:33| No, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21453)|
| 5:57:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21454)|
| 5:57:35| So you're citing this thing and not even knowing the case law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21455)|
| 5:57:37| No, I'm just, I was not talking case law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21457)|
| 5:57:40| I was communicating to you how we define a chronically homeless individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21460)|
| 5:57:46| how the Department of Housing and Urban Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21466)|
| 5:57:48| To your second point, it is acceptable to us and we'd be very agreeable to put this off a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21468)|
| 5:57:56| A month seems to make a lot of sense to our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21476)|
| 5:57:59| and I even communicated this before this came up tonight to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21479)|
| 5:58:03| A month would make sense because we'd have the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21483)|
| 5:58:06| We would have gone through that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21486)|
| 5:58:08| We'd have greater clarity and give us time to continue to talk between now and then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21488)|
| 5:58:14| and then to address this early December, which would work, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21494)|
| 5:58:18| at the December meeting, which would work with our development timetable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21498)|
| 5:58:22| So if this body voted with the current motion to approve to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21502)|
| 5:58:29| and then go to a one month rather than a two month, you could live with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21509)|
| 5:58:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21512)|
| 5:58:33| That's what I said to you before the meeting, and that still stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21513)|
| 5:58:36| I don't think we had a conversation before the meeting, but okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21516)|
| 5:58:38| It was someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21518)|
| 5:58:39| If the maker of the substitute motion would withdraw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21519)|
| 5:58:42| I'll make a substitute, a different substitute motion to defer until the December meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21522)|
| 5:58:47| Ivan Harmon, you made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21527)|
| 5:58:49| Do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21529)|
| 5:58:51| I'm putting it off 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21531)|
| 5:58:52| Yes, we'll do it until December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21532)|
| 5:58:54| December meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21534)|
| 5:58:55| That's satisfactory for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21535)|
| 5:58:57| Yes, that seems to make sense for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21537)|
| 5:58:59| I withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21539)|
| 5:59:00| And does the second agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21540)|
| 5:59:01| Commissioner Lambert, do you agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21541)|
| 5:59:04| I'll make a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21544)|
| 5:59:05| There's no substitute motion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21545)|
| 5:59:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21547)|
| 5:59:08| I'll make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21548)|
| 5:59:09| We defer this matter until our December meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21549)|
| 5:59:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21551)|
| 5:59:19| I'll make a substitute motion on the floor to defer for one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21559)|
| 5:59:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21562)|
| 5:59:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21564)|
| 5:59:25| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21565)|
| 5:59:26| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21566)|
| 5:59:30| 9-0-9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21570)|
| 5:59:33| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21573)|
| 5:59:36| creating a committee to address issues related to the passage of Question 3 on the November 4, 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21576)|
| 5:59:42| general election ballot in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21582)|
| 5:59:46| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21586)|
| 5:59:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21587)|
| 5:59:48| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21588)|
| 5:59:52| No action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21592)|
| 5:59:53| Not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21593)|
| 5:59:54| No action taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21594)|
| 5:59:58| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21598)|
| 6:00:01| Commissioner Luther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21601)|
| 6:00:02| I'll make a motion we withdraw this since there has been a lawsuit filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21602)|
| 6:00:07| I don't think we should take it up until we know what happens with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21607)|
| 6:00:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21612)|
| 6:00:14| You second, Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21614)|
| 6:00:17| He did not well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21617)|
| 6:00:22| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21622)|
| 6:00:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21623)|
| 6:00:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21624)|
| 6:00:25| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21625)|
| 6:00:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21626)|
| 6:00:27| The law director would like to say something about that real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21627)|
| 6:00:31| My only concern with taking no action is that there are some very sensitive time constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21631)|
| 6:00:40| involved in preparing for 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21640)|
| 6:00:47| and this lawsuit could go on for a significant period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21647)|
| 6:00:52| And I would recommend that we proceed on parallel tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21652)|
| 6:00:59| I can't guarantee you that if a task force is put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21659)|
| 6:01:07| and does a great deal of work that it might all be for naught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21667)|
| 6:01:10| However, it also may well be that if this lawsuit proceeds for a significant period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21670)|
| 6:01:18| but is eventually dismissed or the plaintiffs lose on the merits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21678)|
| 6:01:27| that we could still be facing the 2010 election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21687)|
| 6:01:31| and not have done the things that this resolution proposes that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21691)|
| 6:01:39| and we wouldn't be prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21699)|
| 6:01:42| So I'll defer to the wisdom of the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21702)|
| 6:01:46| but I don't think that we can delay for a significant period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21706)|
| 6:01:50| and I certainly don't think we can just wait until this lawsuit is resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21710)|
| 6:01:57| Mr. Chairman, can I address that for just a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21717)|
| 6:02:01| I think the law says that it must be heard within 50 days of the filing of the lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21721)|
| 6:02:08| and I think that once we see the action of what's happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21728)|
| 6:02:17| we can always revisit this either in December or January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21737)|
| 6:02:24| I don't think the drawing of lines is going to take that much time to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21744)|
| 6:02:32| if we can eventually come up with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21752)|
| 6:02:37| And I've spoken with the gentleman that has drawn the last three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21757)|
| 6:02:43| and he feels confident that he could do it again if asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21763)|
| 6:02:48| and do it in fairly short order because he still has all the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21768)|
| 6:02:55| and we would have to use the same numbers as the 2000 census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21775)|
| 6:03:00| So I don't think that that part of it, which is probably the most complex part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21780)|
| 6:03:06| would take too long to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21786)|
| 6:03:09| So I still, although I agree with the law director that we don't need to sit idly by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21789)|
| 6:03:15| I do think that a month or two to see how this lawsuit plays out is still probably best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21795)|
| 6:03:27| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21807)|
| 6:03:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21809)|
| 6:03:31| I did, as I told the Intergovernmental Committee I would do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21811)|
| 6:03:35| talk to Dr. Bruce Ralston at the UT Geography Department who may be able to offer us some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21815)|
| 6:03:41| We may not do so until December, but that's almost on us anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21821)|
| 6:03:45| And I'm certain that the Baker Center would be happy to lend their support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21825)|
| 6:03:50| My office has already contacted the Baker Center to get that process going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21830)|
| 6:03:55| We'll obviously hold off depending on what the pleasure of commission is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21835)|
| 6:04:04| If you want to wait, then we'll put that on hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21844)|
| 6:04:11| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21851)|
| 6:04:15| I would just point out that we have school board districts which already exist, which are nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21855)|
| 6:04:22| which have already passed the muster of law because they've been used in several elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21862)|
| 6:04:28| So we can always use that alternative rather than trying to reinvent the wheel on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21868)|
| 6:04:33| I don't know whose ox I'm goreing on this one, but it is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21873)|
| 6:04:36| It's a relatively easy solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21876)|
| 6:04:40| I think that's something that would obviously, if there were a task force formed pursuant to resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21880)|
| 6:04:48| that would probably be one of the first things looked at to see if that was a viable alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21888)|
| 6:04:57| So, again, some delay is acceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21897)|
| 6:05:04| but lengthy delay could put us in a difficult position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21904)|
| 6:05:10| Commissioner Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21910)|
| 6:05:11| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21911)|
| 6:05:12| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21912)|
| 6:05:13| Mr. Law Director, do you agree with Commissioner Leuthold about the 50-day time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21913)|
| 6:05:17| which will be about the first of the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21917)|
| 6:05:19| Yeah, my concern is appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21919)|
| 6:05:22| Sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21922)|
| 6:05:23| The appeal, it could go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21923)|
| 6:05:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21924)|
| 6:05:25| I mean, it could go on for five years under that scenario, and it probably will be appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21925)|
| 6:05:29| But the 50 days is when it probably will be opened up in a court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21929)|
| 6:05:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21933)|
| 6:05:34| Looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21934)|
| 6:05:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21935)|
| 6:05:36| And then the 2000 census, that's the numbers that have to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21936)|
| 6:05:38| And then it will have to be, 2010 will have to be redone again on it in all probability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21938)|
| 6:05:43| Prior to the 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21943)|
| 6:05:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21945)|
| 6:05:46| I mean, we get actual numbers late 2010 after the election is already held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21946)|
| 6:05:52| So we've got to do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21952)|
| 6:05:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21953)|
| 6:05:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21954)|
| 6:05:56| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21956)|
| 6:05:58| Well, it really, the question here was to withdraw, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21958)|
| 6:06:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21967)|
| 6:06:08| The motion has already been passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21968)|
| 6:06:11| We just withdrew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21971)|
| 6:06:12| We could always bring it back next month or January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21972)|
| 6:06:15| We did withdraw, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21975)|
| 6:06:17| So that's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21977)|
| 6:06:18| Once it's withdrawn, it can be brought back up at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21978)|
| 6:06:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21981)|
| 6:06:22| All we've got to do is pull the wording off of this and get back on the January meeting or February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21982)|
| 6:06:29| Whenever we feel it appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21989)|
| 6:06:32| We had a, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21992)|
| 6:06:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21996)|
| 6:06:38| And two other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=21998)|

| 6:07:34| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22054)|
| 6:07:35| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22055)|
| 6:07:37| We have one discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22057)|
| 6:07:44| It's to call a workshop in January on financial information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22064)|
| 6:07:54| I don't think we need a motion for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22074)|
| 6:07:55| I can just do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22075)|
| 6:07:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22076)|
| 6:07:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22077)|
| 6:07:58| If everybody is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22078)|
| 6:07:59| Sounds good to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22079)|
| 6:08:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22080)|
| 6:08:01| We'll talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22081)|
| 6:08:09| Mr. Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22089)|
| 6:08:10| We need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22090)|
| 6:08:11| Oh, we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22091)|
| 6:08:14| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22094)|
| 6:08:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22095)|
| 6:08:16| I think we've got some people here that the law director wants to talk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22096)|
| 6:08:19| Well, I need to take care of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22099)|
| 6:08:21| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22101)|
| 6:08:23| Appointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22103)|
| 6:08:24| Appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22104)|
| 6:08:27| Commissioner Armstrong to the intergovernmental and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22107)|

| 6:08:31| Beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22111)|
| 6:08:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22116)|
| 6:08:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22117)|
| 6:08:38| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22118)|
| 6:08:39| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22119)|
| 6:08:42| I got one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22122)|
| 6:08:44| We have a Christmas parade coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22124)|
| 6:08:46| Tony, you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22126)|
| 6:08:48| I know we can't get the float.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22128)|
| 6:08:50| I'm the parade guy now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22130)|
| 6:08:53| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22133)|
| 6:08:54| I didn't know if you wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22134)|
| 6:08:55| A second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22135)|
| 6:08:57| But you did such a good job on the parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22137)|
| 6:09:00| I would like to thank the commissioners who were able to come to that parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22140)|
| 6:09:04| I thought it was a great experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22144)|
| 6:09:06| We were able to pass out some of these little service buttons that I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22146)|
| 6:09:15| when I handed them to some of the veterans, I'd given them $1,000 to look on their face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22155)|
| 6:09:21| It was quite a nice experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22161)|
| 6:09:24| So I appreciate those guys that were able to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22164)|
| 6:09:27| I don't know anything about the Christmas parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22167)|
| 6:09:29| I'll be glad to help with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22169)|
| 6:09:31| I have the information in my office, and I'll get it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22171)|
| 6:09:34| I mean, it's no fee or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22174)|
| 6:09:38| We don't have a float this year unless WIVK can do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22178)|
| 6:09:44| Oh, by the way, Mr. Chairman, there was one item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22184)|
| 6:09:47| All those people who would not like to contribute to the purchase of those buttons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22187)|
| 6:09:53| would you please raise your hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22193)|
| 6:09:56| You would not like to contribute to the purchase of the little things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22196)|
| 6:10:03| the service medallions that we gave them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22203)|
| 6:10:06| How much do you need from each of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22206)|
| 6:10:08| I think it was about $40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22208)|
| 6:10:10| It was about $40 is what we needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22210)|
| 6:10:11| Right, Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22211)|
| 6:10:13| Do you have something else, Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22213)|
| 6:10:15| Just one quick idea here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22215)|
| 6:10:19| You know, we've postponed kind of the Hillcrest deal here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22219)|
| 6:10:24| If you remember talking last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22224)|
| 6:10:26| there was a deal with the south property where that we needed to swap some property to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22226)|
| 6:10:33| to realign a road, and there was a KUB property swapping over and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22233)|
| 6:10:40| I would like to separate that and bring that next month as a resolution that we go ahead and do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22240)|
| 6:10:44| rather than hold it up any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22244)|
| 6:10:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22246)|
| 6:10:48| Public Forum, Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22248)|
| 6:10:55| Would you like to tell me the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22255)|
| 6:11:00| How are you all doing tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22260)|
| 6:11:01| My name is Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22261)|
| 6:11:02| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22262)|
| 6:11:07| And I came to speak to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22267)|
| 6:11:10| You all know what I speak to you about every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22270)|
| 6:11:15| I just wanted to reiterate that I was a little disappointed that engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22275)|
| 6:11:19| and public works failed to find a lot of the evidence we needed for the natural resources trial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22279)|
| 6:11:24| until after we went to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22284)|
| 6:11:26| But the rest of my comments I'm going to put off until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22286)|
| 6:11:31| I want to pose to you all a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22291)|
| 6:11:36| If you as a citizen find out that there's several hundred thousand dollars not being paid to your county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22296)|
| 6:11:43| the story for where it goes and if it's been paid changes several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22303)|
| 6:11:48| The excuses for why it was not paid changes several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22308)|
| 6:11:53| The evidence for why it was not paid disappeared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22313)|
| 6:11:57| and magically reappears after we go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22317)|
| 6:12:02| But I'm getting ahead of myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22322)|
| 6:12:04| If you find out money's not being paid to your county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22324)|
| 6:12:07| and that material might be outside of state health standards, what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22327)|
| 6:12:16| It's a legitimate question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22336)|
| 6:12:20| The first step that I made was I called the department head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22340)|
| 6:12:25| The second step that I made was I called the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22345)|
| 6:12:31| I physically sat down with the mayor on June the 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22351)|
| 6:12:34| explained to him, showed him some lab reports that was taken directly from the TDAC file that later became missing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22354)|
| 6:12:42| and I explained to him the money wasn't being paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22362)|
| 6:12:45| I also contacted the Department of Neighborhoods when the mayor became less than professional with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22365)|
| 6:12:54| I contacted Mr. Weitrip, the department head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22374)|
| 6:12:59| I sat and watched county commission last September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22379)|
| 6:13:03| when the mayor and the department head sat right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22383)|
| 6:13:06| and told you that Natural Resources was in complete compliance with their contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22386)|
| 6:13:10| when they later admitted under oath that they had known for months that all this money was missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22390)|
| 6:13:17| After contacting Engineering and Public Works, the department head, Solid Waste, the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22397)|
| 6:13:23| the Department of Neighborhoods, I had a last result file a lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22403)|
| 6:13:30| and expensed it personally to collect this money for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22410)|
| 6:13:36| I actually spoke to the department head last November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22416)|
| 6:13:40| He asked who all knew that this money was not being paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22420)|
| 6:13:44| I explained to him that me, the mulch company, Shamrock Organic Products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22424)|
| 6:13:48| was the three major people that had the evidence, that knew the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22428)|
| 6:13:53| Of course, I immediately received a codes complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22433)|
| 6:13:57| The codes officer told me in a tape-recorded conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22437)|
| 6:14:00| that Engineering and Public Works called codes on me, gave them an address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22440)|
| 6:14:05| told them to go down there and write me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22445)|
| 6:14:07| I gave them the wrong address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22447)|
| 6:14:08| I didn't even own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22448)|
| 6:14:11| Also, Shamrock Organic Products had their air quality permit withheld| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22451)|
| 6:14:16| and the mulch company was sued for retailing mulch off of agriculturally zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22456)|
| 6:14:22| Now, you all touched on something tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22462)|
| 6:14:24| and that has steered me on what I'm going to give to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22464)|
| 6:14:26| and it's going to give you a revelation on something you discussed earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22466)|
| 6:14:30| There is a problem in this county that anybody in the mulch business can open up shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22470)|
| 6:14:35| on an agriculturally zoned piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22475)|
| 6:14:38| You're not zoned for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22478)|
| 6:14:40| You're not approved for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22480)|
| 6:14:42| And nobody will say a word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22482)|
| 6:14:45| People have done it for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22485)|
| 6:14:47| If you live out in the country and you've got a nice piece of farmland across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22487)|
| 6:14:51| and you think it's protected, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22491)|
| 6:14:54| I can open up tomorrow and process sewer sludge, compost, whatever I wish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22494)|
| 6:14:59| and your county will not do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22499)|
| 6:15:02| Well known in the mulch community, and I'm going to explain to you when this started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22502)|
| 6:15:08| About eight years ago, Knox County constructed acreage-wise, not necessarily volume-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22508)|
| 6:15:13| but acreage-wise the largest mulching facility within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22513)|
| 6:15:18| And they constructed it on agriculturally zoned property against their own zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22518)|
| 6:15:24| This did not come to anybody's attention until you all had about $3 million invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22524)|
| 6:15:30| And it left you in the precarious situation of either having to go to Solway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22530)|
| 6:15:34| ask to get the property rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22534)|
| 6:15:37| with every neighbor out there jumping up and down over the serious odor problems that you did have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22537)|
| 6:15:44| What has happened as a result is rather than have to re-approach the Solway community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22544)|
| 6:15:51| to get the property rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22551)|
| 6:15:53| or give the neighborhood the correct way to voice whether or not they wanted it constructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22553)|
| 6:15:59| after it was constructed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22559)|
| 6:16:02| you just had a lax situation in your county where it was easier just to let everybody else buy with the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22562)|
| 6:16:11| We had two choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22571)|
| 6:16:13| Let everybody else get by with the mulch business on agricultural land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22573)|
| 6:16:17| or have to abide by our own rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22577)|
| 6:16:20| This is a little secret that every mulch contractor of any size in Knox County knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22580)|
| 6:16:25| That's why you have so many mulch yards on agriculturally zoned property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22585)|
| 6:16:29| and that's why your engineering and public works department does nothing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22589)|
| 6:16:35| I'm bad about letting the cat out of the bag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22595)|
| 6:16:37| and I guess this already got put before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22597)|
| 6:16:41| I had nothing to do with this being put before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22601)|
| 6:16:43| but since it was discussed and I am in the mulch industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22603)|
| 6:16:46| and I know everything is shaking in Knox County in the mulch industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22606)|
| 6:16:49| I thought I'd come up here and just tell you the truth about the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22609)|
| 6:16:52| That's why you all couldn't understand why you're not enforcing the zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22612)|
| 6:16:56| You all have a good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22616)|
| 6:16:59| Are there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22619)|
| 6:17:02| Meeting adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22622)|
| 6:17:04| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22624)|
| 6:17:06| There's some people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22626)|
| 6:17:07| Are you going to meet them after we've adjourned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=22627)|
