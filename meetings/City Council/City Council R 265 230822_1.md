| 2:39:56| 12A is an ordinance of the Council of the City of Knoxville to amend Chapter 7.5, Article 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9596)|
| 2:40:01| Section 7.5-66 of the Knoxville City Code to adjust the composition of the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9601)|
| 2:40:07| Moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9607)|
| 2:40:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9608)|
| 2:40:09| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9609)|
| 2:40:10| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9610)|
| 2:40:11| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9611)|
| 2:40:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9612)|
| 2:40:13| Mr. Johnson is going to pass out a substitute motion to each council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9613)|
| 2:40:20| Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9620)|
| 2:40:21| Substitute ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9621)|
| 2:40:24| There were a couple of typos that we realized after this went to publication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9624)|
| 2:40:29| Very minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9629)|
| 2:40:31| But I was told this is the way to handle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9631)|
| 2:40:33| So I'll point out the two changes that are in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9633)|
| 2:40:41| In Section B, the Audit Committee shall be composed of seven members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9641)|
| 2:40:49| Four members shall be current members of council appointed by the vice mayor subject to council approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9649)|
| 2:40:55| Three non-city council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9655)|
| 2:40:58| So we just needed that word interjected in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9658)|
| 2:41:02| And then the other addition for the substitute motion, substitute ordinance, is seat A and seat B and C to have staggered terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9662)|
| 2:41:14| so that they can get started with those appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9674)|
| 2:41:18| So I'd like to make a motion to substitute this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9678)|
| 2:41:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9683)|
| 2:41:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9684)|
| 2:41:25| Motion for a substitute to offer a substitute motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9685)|
| 2:41:30| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9690)|
| 2:41:33| I guess we have to vote on the approval of the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9693)|
| 2:41:35| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9695)|
| 2:41:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9697)|
| 2:41:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9698)|
| 2:41:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9699)|
| 2:41:40| The substitute motion is now on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9700)|
| 2:41:42| Any questions or discussion on the motion as substituted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9702)|
| 2:41:45| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9705)|
| 2:41:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9706)|
| 2:41:47| I just want to commend the Audit Committee and the Audit Committee Chair for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9707)|
| 2:41:51| It's something that we've heard discussion about, you know, for some time with the Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9711)|
| 2:41:55| maybe bringing in some folks outside of council with some of this skills and experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9715)|
| 2:42:01| and I just think this is another great thing that is being done to better the Audit Committee going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9721)|
| 2:42:08| So I just wanted to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9728)|
| 2:42:12| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9732)|
| 2:42:13| Yeah, and further elaborate and appreciate everyone who serves on the Audit Committee, past and current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9733)|
| 2:42:21| Basically the change here is to bring the City of Knoxville's Audit Committee in line with what other cities are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9741)|
| 2:42:28| We did a review of Clarksville, Chattanooga, Memphis, Nashville also follows the same model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9748)|
| 2:42:36| We don't use them as a comparison for us because they're metro government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9756)|
| 2:42:40| But those other cities are just basically creating an Audit Committee that reflects what other people are doing in a better practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9760)|
| 2:42:46| based on advice also from MTAS and what other cities are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9766)|
| 2:42:52| So just getting in line with the better practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9772)|
| 2:42:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9778)|
| 2:42:59| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9779)|
| 2:43:01| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9781)|

| 2:43:05| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9785)|
| 2:43:07| 12B is an ordinance appropriating the sum of $6,000 from the Community Empowerment Budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9787)|
| 2:43:12| and donating the same to Creative Community Cultural Arts to support entrepreneurship training and workshops for youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9792)|

| 2:43:30| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9810)|
| 2:43:32| Okay, we have five people signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9812)|
| 2:43:35| First is Mr. John Zieda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9815)|
| 2:43:37| Mr. Zieda, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9817)|
| 2:43:42| I don't think he's here, so we'll move on to the second person, Hannah Freeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9822)|

| 2:43:54| Yeah, thank you, Mayor Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9834)|

| 2:44:07| I think you guys are tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9847)|
| 2:44:10| I do find it ironic that without any reporting, we are giving an organization almost a half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9850)|
| 2:44:18| And we were told, after our rent got doubled, to ask our employers for raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9858)|
| 2:44:24| We were also directed to 211.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9864)|
| 2:44:26| So what I have today is that direction to call 211 and me doing so and some recordings of what was offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9866)|
| 2:44:35| For people in crisis, first, if you or someone you know is in need of making a rental payment and needs help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9875)|
| 2:44:45| you can call 211 to connect with organizations who may be able to assist you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9885)|

| 2:45:04| There's no waiting list, and there's really no definite time that I can give you at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=9904)|

| 2:47:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10078)|

| 2:48:32| 2-1-1 is not a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10112)|
| 2:48:35| Asking our bosses to double our wages to match our doubled rent is not a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10115)|
| 2:48:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10120)|

| 2:48:56| Kay Surrett, Knoxville, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10136)|
| 2:49:01| Born and raised here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10141)|
| 2:49:03| I've lived all over this city my entire life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10143)|
| 2:49:09| Originally, I'm from Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10149)|
| 2:49:12| Most people wouldn't know that about me because of how I carry myself and how I present myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10152)|
| 2:49:19| I'm the only child of an addict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10159)|
| 2:49:22| My father is deceased before I was three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10162)|
| 2:49:29| I'm divorced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10169)|
| 2:49:32| And, again, I have three children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10172)|
| 2:49:36| I've been divorced for over 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10176)|
| 2:49:39| No financial assistance, no child support, alimony, none of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10179)|
| 2:49:44| because we agreed to keep things civil and out of court because it was best for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10184)|
| 2:49:52| As I mentioned earlier, my bring-home pay, because I get paid biweekly, is a little over $32,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10192)|
| 2:50:04| I have some data from, and I say all that just to kind of put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10204)|
| 2:50:11| I don't have family to rely on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10211)|
| 2:50:13| I don't have anyone that I can fall back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10213)|
| 2:50:17| If I give up, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10217)|
| 2:50:22| If I don't continue to push, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10222)|
| 2:50:27| I don't have the ability to bury my head in the sand and ignore this problem, which is the increase in rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10227)|
| 2:50:37| Our city has seen this coming for the last several years, and it's not going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10237)|
| 2:50:42| We have businesses coming in from out of state, from the Midwest of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10242)|
| 2:50:50| who do not know Knoxville, who do not know our culture, and do not know our economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10250)|
| 2:50:57| We have people coming in that are squeezing us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10257)|
| 2:51:02| Some of the data that I mentioned is from MIT, from the living wage calculation for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10262)|
| 2:51:11| The living wage for someone with three children should be $52.19 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10271)|
| 2:51:21| I make roughly $19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10281)|
| 2:51:27| I asked my boss this past week for a raise, just giving a conversation about what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10287)|
| 2:51:38| Her jaw dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10298)|
| 2:51:40| My last cost of living raise was two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10300)|
| 2:51:47| The poverty wage is $13.34 for someone with three children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10307)|
| 2:51:54| So according to this, I'm somewhere between poverty and living, but I'm not living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10314)|
| 2:52:00| I am working my butt off to make ends meet, and I'm not making ends meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10320)|
| 2:52:06| And I know that there are a lot of people that come here week after week who fit that same bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10326)|
| 2:52:16| It breaks down typical expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10336)|
| 2:52:21| Food for three children for a year is about $11,540.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10341)|

| 2:52:33| Housing is about $15,855.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10353)|
| 2:52:38| You combine just those three items, that's a little over $36,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10358)|
| 2:52:45| My salary doesn't reach that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10365)|
| 2:52:48| My salary doesn't reach that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10368)|
| 2:52:50| So I took on a second job part-time this past December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10370)|
| 2:52:55| I have to work it around my schedule with my children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10375)|
| 2:52:59| and still have time for myself in order to take care of my mental health and my own well-being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10379)|
| 2:53:07| There's another item listed of other, which I'm going to assume it's about clothing and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10387)|
| 2:53:14| just miscellaneous items, and it's almost $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10394)|
| 2:53:18| It goes on to list required annual income after taxes for a person with three children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10398)|
| 2:53:23| one adult, three children, is $91,566.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10403)|
| 2:53:28| Mayor, I know that you are a big proponent that Knoxville has very low wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10408)|
| 2:53:33| We are presenting a problem to you, and we need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10413)|
| 2:53:37| We don't need to be told to call 211.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10417)|
| 2:53:40| As you've heard, that's not a resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10420)|
| 2:53:42| That's not help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10422)|
| 2:53:44| We ask you and implore you for a solution because our homeless population is growing and will continue to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10424)|
| 2:53:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10437)|

| 2:54:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10461)|
| 2:54:27| About the last 20 years, I've been living that kind of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10467)|
| 2:54:32| You know, you wake up in the morning, everything's good, but you know you've got to go through some stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10472)|
| 2:54:41| You know, you think, okay, people are telling me, you know, how intelligent I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10481)|
| 2:54:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10490)|
| 2:54:52| All that good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10492)|
| 2:54:54| Rick, you work hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10494)|
| 2:54:56| Every time I see you, you're working hard and you're doing this for other people and blah, blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10496)|
| 2:55:00| But you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10500)|
| 2:55:01| I get up and I go through a day and it's rough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10501)|
| 2:55:10| It's rough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10510)|
| 2:55:13| And I don't think people understand that for somebody who is supposed to be as highly functional as I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10513)|
| 2:55:20| or am supposed to be, that it's a crap shoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10520)|
| 2:55:28| And I'm a native Knoxvillian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10528)|
| 2:55:30| I grew up in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10530)|
| 2:55:32| I've been all over Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10532)|
| 2:55:34| I know nooks and crannies that some of you would never believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10534)|
| 2:55:40| And when I was younger, it was a nice place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10540)|
| 2:55:45| It really was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10545)|
| 2:55:47| It was a good place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10547)|
| 2:55:49| Didn't know any different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10549)|
| 2:55:50| That's with all the other crap that I now realize that went on, was going on as I was growing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10550)|
| 2:55:59| And then I started paying attention to a lot of the crap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10559)|
| 2:56:04| A bunch of the crap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10564)|
| 2:56:05| And I'm using this word because that's the best word I got for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10565)|
| 2:56:10| Along the way, I've met nice people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10570)|
| 2:56:14| Great people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10574)|
| 2:56:16| But then, all of a sudden, I realized that there's a lot of dysfunction in this place called Knoxville, Tennessee, in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10576)|
| 2:56:28| A lot of dysfunction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10588)|
| 2:56:30| And it became a picture, a microscopic picture, of what probably is going on out in the world today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10590)|
| 2:56:42| This place needs a lot of healing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10602)|
| 2:56:45| A lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10605)|
| 2:56:47| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10607)|
| 2:56:50| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10610)|
| 2:56:51| I don't know how to emphasize it anymore to maybe spur people on to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10611)|
| 2:57:01| I mean, when you see people lose their stuff, and the system is so confusing, it is so dysfunctional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10621)|
| 2:57:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10635)|
| 2:57:16| You guys are leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10636)|
| 2:57:17| You went out there and you requested people to vote for you, and this is what we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10637)|
| 2:57:24| And then the people, your hirelings, just keep it going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10644)|
| 2:57:32| And this is not to discredit folk or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10652)|
| 2:57:36| I mean, I've had people basically tell me the same thing in particular situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10656)|
| 2:57:42| That they thought that what I was doing was only causing misery and pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10662)|
| 2:57:50| And I take that to heart, and that's probably why I end up standing in front of you guys and saying what I say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10670)|
| 2:57:58| Because I couldn't put myself in those positions anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10678)|
| 2:58:03| I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10683)|
| 2:58:05| I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10685)|
| 2:58:07| And I beg of you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10687)|
| 2:58:11| And I don't beg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10691)|
| 2:58:13| Most people that know me know I don't ask for crap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10693)|
| 2:58:16| I want to say they ask for it, but you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10696)|
| 2:58:23| You guys have a responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10703)|
| 2:58:30| I'm just frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10710)|
| 2:58:32| And I don't like to say I'm frustrated with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10712)|
| 2:58:34| But I see people do stuff over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10714)|
| 2:58:37| And then when you try to put them in check and say, hey, man, listen, this isn't working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10717)|
| 2:58:42| Stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10722)|
| 2:58:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10724)|
| 2:58:45| Yeah, Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10725)|
| 2:58:49| And it goes on and on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10729)|
| 2:58:51| And so I've questioned you all's reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10731)|
| 2:58:56| I've questioned your environment that postures this stuff to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10736)|
| 2:59:06| And I'm telling you, it's going to be a situation where one day everybody is going to wake up at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10746)|
| 2:59:14| And it's going to be hell on earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10754)|
| 2:59:19| The last person signed up for public forum is Nikki Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10759)|
| 2:59:28| My name's Nikki Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10768)|

| 2:59:38| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10778)|
| 2:59:40| First of all, I want to thank the council members that came out to Tanglewood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10780)|

| 3:00:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10800)|
| 3:00:02| I would like to ask the council to raise your hand if you've ever rented an apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10802)|
| 3:00:12| Can I get that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10812)|
| 3:00:15| One, two, three, four, five, six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10815)|
| 3:00:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10821)|
| 3:00:22| How many of you have rented an apartment in the last five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10822)|
| 3:00:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10829)|
| 3:00:30| That explains our problem right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10830)|
| 3:00:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10832)|
| 3:00:33| I am 33 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10833)|
| 3:00:35| I've gone to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10835)|
| 3:00:36| I have a four year four year degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10836)|
| 3:00:39| Two bachelors of science, one in public policy and one in environmental studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10839)|
| 3:00:44| I work in a non-profit and I have for the last 19 years I've worked in non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10844)|
| 3:00:50| And this is appalling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10850)|
| 3:00:52| I go to work every day to work for solutions for homeless in and around Knox County because it's an issue across all of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10852)|
| 3:01:05| And you know what I do with my free time in the evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10865)|
| 3:01:08| Well, for the last month it's been organizing with my neighbors that have already spoken because we need a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10868)|
| 3:01:16| Those evenings are spent looking for assistance for my neighbors who can't find it at 211.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10876)|
| 3:01:23| Those evenings are spent looking for someone to translate for a single dad who has limited English skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10883)|
| 3:01:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10890)|
| 3:01:32| It's a real thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10892)|
| 3:01:36| We've got folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10896)|
| 3:01:38| We're building a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10898)|
| 3:01:40| We're the people that you need to be talking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10900)|
| 3:01:42| We're the ones that need to be sitting in on these project pilot councils, sessions, working groups because we are the ones that are still in touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10902)|
| 3:01:58| If you haven't rented in the last five years, in the last year you don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10918)|
| 3:02:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10924)|
| 3:02:07| It's imperative that you include us in the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10927)|
| 3:02:11| And right now that's not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10931)|
| 3:02:14| Because if we were being included in this conversation, we would already be looking at community land trusts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10934)|
| 3:02:19| We would already be talking to the state government about policy changes around housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10939)|
| 3:02:27| Really excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10947)|
| 3:02:29| Mental health needs to be addressed in this state, in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10949)|
| 3:02:32| But why can't we send a delegation to the state to talk about the laws regarding rent control?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10952)|
| 3:02:37| It's unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10957)|
| 3:02:39| I've asked for that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10959)|
| 3:02:41| That's your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10961)|
| 3:02:43| Literally is to speak on our behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10963)|
| 3:02:46| If you can't relate to us, at least listen and do what we've put you in your position for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10966)|
| 3:02:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10976)|
| 3:02:57| I want to remind everyone that this is a democratic country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10977)|
| 3:03:04| That means that we have laws to hold folks accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10984)|
| 3:03:09| Yes, it's election season now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10989)|
| 3:03:11| Is it election season next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10991)|
| 3:03:15| I want you to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10995)|
| 3:03:16| Is it election season for you next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10996)|
| 3:03:19| It might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=10999)|
| 3:03:21| Because we can always do a recall vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=11001)|
| 3:03:23| If you all aren't doing your jobs and aren't listening to us, as a community, we've come together to support each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=11003)|
| 3:03:29| We've come together to try to provide services that 211 won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=11009)|
| 3:03:33| Because that's the answer we've gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=11013)|
| 3:03:35| If you aren't going to help us do those things, then we don't need you in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=11015)|
| 3:03:42| So just remember that evictions, which is what a lot of my neighbors are facing, are unethical, wrong, and criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=11022)|
| 3:03:56| And that we should have more housing over greed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=11036)|
| 3:04:10| I'm not using your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=11050)|
| 3:04:12| We're going to sit here for the next 17 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=11052)|
| 3:04:16| Because I want the body to think about what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=11056)|
| 3:04:24| I've wasted the last three and a half almost hours with you all tonight with no action, because I waited that long last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=11064)|
| 3:04:38| Council member said concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=11078)|
| 3:04:40| And without objection, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230822?start=11080)|
