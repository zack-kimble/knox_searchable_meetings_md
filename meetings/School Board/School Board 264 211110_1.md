| 2:32:42| The reason I'm here tonight is to ask you to please block access from student computers to YouTube.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9162)|
| 2:32:53| I think this is a reasonable proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9173)|
| 2:32:56| And I think there's three reasons I want to give you why I would like you to consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9176)|
| 2:33:00| Number one, YouTube is hugely distracting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9180)|
| 2:33:04| As anyone who's been on YouTube can tell you, one video leads to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9184)|
| 2:33:09| Every time you watch a video, ten more recommendations pop up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9189)|
| 2:33:13| And to a 13-year-old or 11-year-old or 8-year-old that's trying to make the choice between doing Delta math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9193)|
| 2:33:19| and watching clips from, you know, Marvel Avengers, it's very, very difficult to keep them focused and on task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9199)|
| 2:33:29| The second reason is that there's objectionable content on YouTube.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9209)|
| 2:33:34| And I know the school's filters catch the worst of it, but they don't catch all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9214)|
| 2:33:40| And I just want to give you one example of what I saw in my daughter's YouTube video history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9220)|
| 2:33:46| It was a video, something to the effect of how to look and dress like you're 21 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9226)|
| 2:33:52| And featured in this video was a young girl, maybe 8, 10 years old, wearing a mini skirt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9232)|
| 2:33:59| sitting with her legs crossed in a very adult pose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9239)|
| 2:34:04| I don't want my 8-year-old daughter to have access to videos like this on her school-issued laptop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9244)|
| 2:34:11| The third reason why I think this is a good idea is that YouTube leads to excessive screen time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9251)|
| 2:34:21| My wife and I, like a lot of parents, we really try and limit our kids' access to screen time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9261)|
| 2:34:27| That's for good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9267)|
| 2:34:28| There's studies out there that say excessive screen time leads to, interferes with sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9268)|
| 2:34:33| It leads to anxiety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9273)|
| 2:34:35| It leads to depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9275)|
| 2:34:37| It leads to health problems like obesity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9277)|
| 2:34:41| There's one study that was cited in the Journal of American Pediatrics from 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9281)|
| 2:34:47| It was about TV usage, but I think it applies equally to other screens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9287)|
| 2:34:51| As screen time increases, academic performance decreases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9291)|
| 2:34:57| All of this is to say that we know technology is part of our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9297)|
| 2:35:01| It's part of our children's lives, but let's make technology work for us, not against us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9301)|
| 2:35:07| I would ask you to please consider a top-to-bottom review of what online content is available to children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9307)|
| 2:35:15| on school-issued laptops, and to please block access to objectionable or distracting content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9315)|
| 2:35:23| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9323)|
| 2:35:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9326)|
| 2:35:27| Madam Chair, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9327)|
| 2:35:34| Meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9334)|
| 2:35:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211110?start=9345)|
