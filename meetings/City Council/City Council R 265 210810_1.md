| 2:31:56| If you look on page 766, I'm going to scroll to that here, item number three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9116)|
| 2:32:05| it says that the permittee has provided notice to the beer inspector at least 30 days in advance of the event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9125)|
| 2:32:12| of the permittee's intent to use volunteers to serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9132)|
| 2:32:16| We meant to put 15 days in that, and so I would request an amendment to change that to 15 days from 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9136)|
| 2:32:25| I'll second your amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9145)|
| 2:32:27| Okay, the motion made to amend has been made by Council Member Roberto and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9147)|
| 2:32:33| One more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9153)|
| 2:32:34| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9154)|
| 2:32:37| Vice Mayor McKenzie, you have a comment on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9157)|
| 2:32:42| Well, kind of going back to the entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9162)|
| 2:32:45| Let's consider the amendment first, and then we'll go back to the larger discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9165)|
| 2:32:52| Does everyone understand the amendment before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9172)|
| 2:32:57| Okay, are there any questions or discussion about the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9177)|
| 2:33:00| Seeing none, all those in favor of the amendment, please vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9180)|
| 2:33:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9183)|
| 2:33:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9184)|
| 2:33:05| I'm going to abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9185)|
| 2:33:06| Okay, 8-0 and one abstention on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9186)|
| 2:33:10| Now back to the original motion as amended, Vice Mayor, and then we'll go back to Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9190)|
| 2:33:17| I just want to ask a clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9197)|
| 2:33:20| So we're saying that this is also going to be a mechanism for nonprofits to be able to make some funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9200)|
| 2:33:26| So what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9206)|
| 2:33:28| I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9208)|
| 2:33:29| So it's also stated that nonprofits would have an opportunity to have some funds as a result of their volunteerism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9209)|
| 2:33:38| that will be donated to their organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9218)|
| 2:33:40| Could you speak a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9220)|
| 2:33:42| Is it a percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9222)|
| 2:33:43| Is it number of, you know, beers sold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9223)|
| 2:33:46| No, it's the differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9226)|
| 2:33:48| It's how many people you bring to each game, the commitment for how many games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9228)|
| 2:33:51| There's kind of escalators in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9231)|
| 2:33:54| So it all depends on how much you participate, really, and how many stands you're working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9234)|
| 2:33:59| So there's a number of things that go into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9239)|
| 2:34:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9245)|
| 2:34:06| So if I had an organization, a nonprofit, and we went through all this and we staffed three stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9246)|
| 2:34:14| how much would we make or would we have to make a long-term commitment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9254)|
| 2:34:20| Again, it's going to depend on the number of stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9260)|
| 2:34:22| I would ask Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9262)|
| 2:34:24| I mean, I think last year we probably gave 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9264)|
| 2:34:29| What was the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9269)|
| 2:34:31| How much money did we give?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9271)|
| 2:34:32| Dave, you need to come to the podium if you're going to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9272)|
| 2:34:36| I'm just trying to get a handle on the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9276)|
| 2:34:38| I mean, it's several hundred thousand dollars that goes back into the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9278)|
| 2:34:44| and it's distributed amongst the different groups, and, again, depending on how many stands they staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9284)|
| 2:34:49| how many games they work, how many volunteers they bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9289)|
| 2:34:52| Can you give us an example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9292)|
| 2:34:53| Sorry, can you give us an example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9293)|
| 2:34:55| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9295)|
| 2:34:56| Can you give us an example of a game event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9296)|
| 2:35:02| I would say an average group, an average band of the group is somewhere $700,000 a game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9302)|
| 2:35:12| $700,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9312)|
| 2:35:13| $700,000 to $1,000 per game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9313)|
| 2:35:15| Oh, $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9315)|
| 2:35:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9316)|
| 2:35:17| She was about to sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9317)|
| 2:35:18| I was like, I'm going to switch to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9318)|
| 2:35:23| $700,000 to $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9323)|
| 2:35:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9324)|
| 2:35:25| Thanks for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9325)|
| 2:35:26| Vice Mayor, any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9326)|
| 2:35:27| No, I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9327)|
| 2:35:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9328)|
| 2:35:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9329)|
| 2:35:30| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9330)|
| 2:35:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9332)|
| 2:35:35| And I don't know if this is something for you, Mr. McDonald, or for somebody from the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9335)|
| 2:35:40| but Mr. Frost was letting me know that it looks like the electronic devices you can implement earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9340)|
| 2:35:49| than we had given you time for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9349)|
| 2:35:52| It looks like you're willing to move that up to January 1st, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9352)|
| 2:35:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9357)|
| 2:35:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9358)|
| 2:35:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9359)|
| 2:36:00| So I'd also offer an amendment to the electronic device section, which is on page 766, number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9360)|
| 2:36:07| six, that we change by August 15th, 2022 to January 1st, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9367)|
| 2:36:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9376)|
| 2:36:17| Everyone heard the motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9377)|
| 2:36:18| Is anyone willing to second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9378)|
| 2:36:19| I'll second that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9379)|
| 2:36:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9380)|
| 2:36:21| Is there anyone willing to amend per what Mr. Roberto said and second it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9381)|
| 2:36:26| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9386)|
| 2:36:27| Seeing none, all those in favor of the proposed amendment, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9387)|
| 2:36:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9391)|
| 2:36:32| Oh, Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9392)|
| 2:36:33| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9393)|
| 2:36:34| Abstaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9394)|
| 2:36:35| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9395)|
| 2:36:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9396)|
| 2:36:37| The amendment passes 8-0 with one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9397)|
| 2:36:40| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9400)|
| 2:36:42| Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9402)|
| 2:36:44| I think I would feel more comfortable with this if, because what we've been talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9404)|
| 2:36:50| is a creative solution to not having enough employees there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9410)|
| 2:36:54| You know, and then I see the nonprofit aspect, and that's good for nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9414)|
| 2:36:59| But I feel more comfortable with this if first you tried to get employees by paying more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9419)|
| 2:37:04| and then if that did not work, employing volunteers, it seems if you're at $10 an hour, what type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9424)|
| 2:37:12| of response would you get if you were paying $15 an hour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9432)|
| 2:37:17| Just the history we've had in other locations, that's not really going to move the needle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9437)|
| 2:37:21| Some of this is a tipped position as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9441)|
| 2:37:24| So, you know, I don't see the increment moving the needle as much as we need it to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9444)|
| 2:37:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9452)|
| 2:37:33| You know, we had initially, as I said, over 200 bartenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9453)|
| 2:37:36| We're down to 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9456)|
| 2:37:39| We need to really triple that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9459)|
| 2:37:41| And I don't see, even if we did attract those bartenders, it still wouldn't be enough to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9461)|
| 2:37:46| satisfy the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9466)|
| 2:37:50| Thank you, Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9470)|
| 2:37:52| Seeing no further questions or discussion, the motion on the floor as amended, not once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9472)|
| 2:37:57| but twice, is now before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9477)|
| 2:37:59| Does everyone understand what they're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9479)|
| 2:38:01| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9481)|
| 2:38:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9483)|
| 2:38:04| Any opposed, say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9484)|
| 2:38:05| I'm opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9485)|
| 2:38:06| You're opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9486)|
| 2:38:07| Not abstaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9487)|
| 2:38:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9488)|
| 2:38:09| Motion carries 7-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9489)|
| 2:38:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9492)|
| 2:38:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9493)|

| 2:38:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9495)|

| 2:40:33| Ms. Proctor, you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9633)|
| 2:40:39| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9639)|
| 2:40:41| My name is Kathy Proctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9641)|
| 2:40:43| I live at 2429 Lakemore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9643)|
| 2:40:46| I am also a resident of Lakemore Hills for 20 years, and I chair the Alcoa Highway Beautification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9646)|
| 2:40:57| Council, and we're a group of residents from both sides of Alcoa Highway, east and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9657)|
| 2:41:03| That represent various groups, some homeowner associations from the different neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9663)|
| 2:41:10| some garden clubs, and a 501C3 from Lakemore Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9670)|
| 2:41:15| And over the past few years, we've been working with TDOT, the City of Knoxville, and Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9675)|
| 2:41:20| County to ensure that the expansion and construction along Alcoa Highway would have pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9680)|
| 2:41:28| access across the bridges, continuation of the greenway from Knoxville to Blount County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9688)|
| 2:41:34| inclusion of roundabouts, which weren't in the original zone, rather than four-way stops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9694)|
| 2:41:39| and a development of a landscape plan that will be implemented after the conclusion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9699)|
| 2:41:46| the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| And we appreciate that the city has put some funding towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9708)|
| 2:41:52| A few years ago, MPC updated their sector plan and held a public presentation in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9712)|
| 2:41:59| area, which I attended, and they showed us potential zoning changes that could help enrich| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9719)|
| 2:42:04| the development of the commercial corridor along Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9724)|
| 2:42:10| This presentation included a section that included a multifamily development, and at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9730)|
| 2:42:15| that time, most of the residents were pretty opposed to that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9735)|
| 2:42:20| But MPC staff showed us that to get the services that we need in the area along Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9740)|
| 2:42:28| we needed to have an increase of residents to be able to support those businesses and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9748)|
| 2:42:33| services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9753)|
| 2:42:35| So years have passed since that presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9755)|
| 2:42:38| No multifamily has been built, and we've seen business after business go out of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9758)|
| 2:42:44| and relocate other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9764)|
| 2:42:47| The road construction and the lack of additional residents in our area have killed this commercial corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9767)|
| 2:42:55| So in June of 2019, our Beautification Council partnered with East Tennessee Community Design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9775)|
| 2:43:01| Center to hold a half-day workshop to take a look at ways to bring some commercial businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9781)|
| 2:43:09| back to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9789)|
| 2:43:11| We had residents, business owners, property owners, developers, design professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9791)|
| 2:43:16| and MPC staff attend, about 75 people in all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9796)|
| 2:43:21| And we divided into four teams, looked at the areas that have died between Maloney Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9801)|
| 2:43:29| and Montlake Road, and came up with different solutions of what would bring this area back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9809)|
| 2:43:36| to life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9816)|
| 2:43:37| Each one of the teams independently included multifamily residential as part of their solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9817)|
| 2:43:44| because they realized we had to have more people in order to have services that would survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9824)|
| 2:43:50| And these designs included grocery stores, gas station, banks, restaurant, a visitor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9830)|
| 2:43:57| center to Knoxville, a library, and other creative ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9837)|
| 2:44:02| I have to admit I was a real skeptic about the need for multifamily in that previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9842)|
| 2:44:08| presentation by MPC in the South Sector Plan, but now I fully understand and support that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9848)|
| 2:44:15| it is absolutely essential in order to get some services back that all of the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9855)|
| 2:44:21| in that area truly need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9861)|
| 2:44:23| So the project that you're looking at today appears to be, to us, a thoughtful design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9863)|
| 2:44:28| in the appropriate location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9868)|
| 2:44:31| Their targeted group seems to be a group of professionals that can afford $1,300 to $2,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9871)|
| 2:44:38| a month in rent, which would be people that could support these businesses in addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9878)|
| 2:44:44| to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9884)|
| 2:44:45| The traffic impact of this additional residences would be mitigated by them being located exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9885)|
| 2:44:54| adjacent to the entry to Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9894)|
| 2:44:59| And what we have been able to see is that the developers' commitment to the landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9899)|
| 2:45:04| plan as part of their design ties directly to the landscape design that our team has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9904)|
| 2:45:13| developed, and the buffer zones are exactly what's needed in order to create a safe transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9913)|
| 2:45:21| between the single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9921)|
| 2:45:25| And we think that this would be a welcome addition to the Alcoa Highway and also help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9925)|
| 2:45:31| to enhance this entry to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9931)|
| 2:45:35| What I've seen is change is always difficult, but I think this change is needed to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9935)|
| 2:45:40| this area of Knoxville back to life, and the Alcoa Highway Beautification Council supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9940)|
| 2:45:46| this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9946)|

| 2:46:03| you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9963)|

| 2:46:12| You've received a brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9972)|
| 2:46:14| If you could just tell us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9974)|
| 2:46:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9977)|
| 2:46:18| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9978)|
| 2:46:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9979)|
| 2:46:20| I thought everybody knew me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9980)|
| 2:46:23| I'm Gene Burr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9983)|
| 2:46:25| I live at 3621 Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9985)|
| 2:46:28| I've been here for almost 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9988)|
| 2:46:33| The things that I would like to mention, kind of highlights in the scenario that Ms. Proctor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=9993)|
| 2:46:41| just described, is that you can't rebuild a highway that has to handle 58,000 cars a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10001)|
| 2:46:52| day without destroying the environment around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10012)|
| 2:46:57| So part of the response of the neighbors was to kind of put the trees back in place that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10017)|
| 2:47:05| had to be destroyed to widen the highway and to build the interchanges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10025)|
| 2:47:12| So I think there's been a kind of a cumulative response on the part of the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10032)|
| 2:47:20| and the neighbors, about 8,000 to 10,000 people in that corridor, our demographic profile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10040)|
| 2:47:28| indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10048)|
| 2:47:30| So there's a reasonable support base for some things, but they tended to just disappear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10050)|
| 2:47:36| We haven't had a grocery store in eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10056)|
| 2:47:40| Used to be a bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10060)|
| 2:47:44| It used to be most of the things that you need on a day-to-day basis, and today it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10064)|
| 2:47:49| a blighted strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10069)|
| 2:47:52| To recover that blighted strip and make it productive again is going to take a lot of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10072)|
| 2:48:00| The planning study that the Planning Commission had been indicating they needed for this corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10080)|
| 2:48:10| because the Planning Commission staff was overwhelmed at the time, kept kind of being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10090)|
| 2:48:16| pushed down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10096)|
| 2:48:18| So the idea of the design surrept that Ms. Proctor just described to you came about with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10098)|
| 2:48:24| the encouragement of Ms. Brooks' predecessor, Gerald Green, who said if you want to jump-start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10104)|
| 2:48:31| that planning study to show the things that you need in order to support a diverse, productive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10111)|
| 2:48:40| economically successful neighborhood center, then you need to jump-start that with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10120)|
| 2:48:51| like a surrept and get a number of people involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10131)|
| 2:48:55| It was interesting, as Ms. Proctor indicated, that the developers who were involved in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10135)|
| 2:48:59| surrept said that you're going to have to bolster your residential population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10139)|
| 2:49:05| The project that surfaced, and it was interesting that our group monitored the KCIS starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10145)|
| 2:49:22| in November to see what properties were going to be advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10162)|
| 2:49:27| The property that Dominion had selected for their apartment complex was the first one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10167)|
| 2:49:35| surfaced as available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10175)|
| 2:49:38| We were scared in the absence of the planning study that we had been urging the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10178)|
| 2:49:43| Commission to do, we were scared that that property was going to be preempted by something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10183)|
| 2:49:48| that would have an adverse effect on the entire corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10188)|
| 2:49:52| It's pure happenstance, in a way, that Dominion came along and made this proposal, but it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10192)|
| 2:49:58| the right project in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10198)|
| 2:50:01| There's a time-worn principle in the planning profession that if you're going to put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10201)|
| 2:50:06| multifamily development, you put it between your single-family development and your more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10206)|
| 2:50:11| intense business and commercial activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10211)|
| 2:50:15| It is a project that has come along at the right time, and I think it's in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10215)|
| 2:50:23| The added benefit to the city since 1990s when Mayor Ash did his finger annexations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10223)|
| 2:50:31| and you don't need to see the details here, but the red is commercial and the yellow is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10231)|
| 2:50:37| residential, and that's what a finger annexation looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10237)|
| 2:50:41| When this corridor is redeveloped and it starts returning decent taxes again, the city will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10241)|
| 2:50:48| benefit, so that's kind of a bonus to this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10248)|
| 2:50:56| I appreciate the opportunity to speak before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10256)|
| 2:50:59| This has been a passionate undertaking since the 1980s for me, and it would make me so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10259)|
| 2:51:09| happy to see it come to fruition knowing the benefits that would accrue to the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10269)|
| 2:51:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10276)|
| 2:51:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10277)|
| 2:51:19| Next person signed up to speak to this is Mary Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10279)|
| 2:51:23| Ms. Miller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10283)|
| 2:51:28| You could start by stating your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10288)|
| 2:51:33| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10293)|
| 2:51:35| My name is Mary Miller, and I am a resident at 3918 Shipwatch Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10295)|
| 2:51:41| I'm also here on behalf of Catherine Collins, who lives in the South Oaks subdivision on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10301)|
| 2:51:47| Maloney Road at 5600 Oakside Drive, just a short distance away from this proposed project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10307)|
| 2:51:54| Unlike others here, I am a resident of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10314)|
| 2:51:58| I live in the Anchorage subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10318)|
| 2:52:01| We are opposed to this project because there's not sufficient infrastructure, support, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10321)|
| 2:52:06| services on the South Ocoa Highway Connector to support this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10326)|
| 2:52:12| You're talking about bringing 300 to 600 residents inside the city, and right now, there's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10332)|
| 2:52:19| enough support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10339)|
| 2:52:20| There's going to be increased traffic and speeding on Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10340)|
| 2:52:24| There's a new subdivision on Miracle Pike that feeds out off of Maloney Road onto Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10344)|
| 2:52:33| It's right at the intersection with Severe Heights, which creates significant traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10353)|
| 2:52:39| We will have increased delivery services, and already, there's significant speeding on Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10359)|
| 2:52:47| There is a one-lane road on the railroad trestle at the other end of Maloney Road, and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10367)|
| 2:52:56| no proposal to deal with that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10376)|
| 2:53:02| We have seen significant increased crime in South Knoxville over the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10382)|
| 2:53:08| I live in the Anchorage subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10388)|
| 2:53:10| There was the murder at the Ball strip club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10390)|
| 2:53:14| There's been a significant increase in thefts in our subdivision right off Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10394)|
| 2:53:22| There were two, but to address the issue about services and the inability to provide services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10402)|
| 2:53:30| we have had two boating accidents in our subdivision in the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10410)|
| 2:53:35| In June, there were two deaths as a result of a personal watercraft accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10415)|
| 2:53:41| None of the emergency services knew how to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10421)|
| 2:53:44| There just wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10424)|
| 2:53:46| Every time we've had that kind of accident in our subdivision, the police, the fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10426)|
| 2:53:54| the emergency rescue do not know where to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10434)|
| 2:53:58| We do not have enough services in South Knoxville and on the Alcoa Highway to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10438)|
| 2:54:05| this increased amount of residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10445)|
| 2:54:11| The final thing I would say is, or two things, there's a discussion about this as a blighted strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10451)|
| 2:54:18| We all know why this is a blighted strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10458)|
| 2:54:20| It's because of the construction on Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10460)|
| 2:54:23| Once the construction is completed, this strip will start to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10463)|
| 2:54:29| Secondly, if this blighted strip, there's plenty of area there that that's where this project could go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10469)|
| 2:54:36| National Fitness Center is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10476)|
| 2:54:38| Hardee's is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10478)|
| 2:54:39| There's a significant area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10479)|
| 2:54:41| There are alternative sites for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10481)|
| 2:54:44| And I would note that it's easy to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10484)|
| 2:54:49| we would approve this when you don't live on that side of the highway and you're not impacted by that traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10489)|
| 2:55:00| Again, we would say the city does not have enough support structure in South Knoxville to support this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10500)|
| 2:55:09| and we would request that you reject it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10509)|
| 2:55:14| Thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10514)|
| 2:55:15| That concludes people signed up to speak to Item 12-K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10515)|
| 2:55:20| There's a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10520)|
| 2:55:22| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10522)|
| 2:55:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10524)|
| 2:55:25| I think, first of all, I want to thank everybody for coming to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10525)|
| 2:55:29| I know a lot of people have weighed into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10529)|
| 2:55:32| I've been on this road in this area a lot and recently went over there quite a bit to make sure I remembered everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10532)|
| 2:55:41| I also watched the Planning Commission meeting that was held on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10541)|
| 2:55:44| and there was a good discussion about this corridor, its history, and what it needs and what we all want back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10544)|
| 2:55:51| I do have some questions as it relates to services that Ms. Miller brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10551)|
| 2:55:56| because recently I've heard that concern from a number of neighbors near Ms. Miller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10556)|
| 2:56:03| so I think it's worth discussing that particularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10563)|
| 2:56:07| But just before that, I do think it's important to remember that part of the reason for density in this area is for additional services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10567)|
| 2:56:16| So I understand the chicken-or-egg balance between we need more services, we need more people, we need more people to get more services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10576)|
| 2:56:24| So before we get into much discussion, I want to make sure I understand how, particularly for public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10584)|
| 2:56:31| and this is for somebody in the administration, whether it's Chief Sharp or somebody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10591)|
| 2:56:37| how do we consider locations of fire stations or routes of police officers as it relates to population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10597)|
| 2:56:48| particularly this finger annex that we're all familiar with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10608)|
| 2:56:54| Chief Sharp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10614)|
| 2:56:57| Thank you, Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10617)|
| 2:56:59| We're always evaluating and reevaluating the services that we provide to the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10619)|
| 2:57:06| and part of that includes looking at specific areas and seeing if we need to expand our services into those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10626)|
| 2:57:14| You need to speak into the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10634)|
| 2:57:16| I'm sorry, you want me to repeat all that, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10636)|
| 2:57:19| I think we, Mr. Smith, Councilmember Smith, did you hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10639)|
| 2:57:22| I think I may have accidentally hit my mute button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10642)|
| 2:57:25| Okay, now we can hear you. Just keep facing the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10645)|
| 2:57:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10648)|
| 2:57:29| Yeah, we're always evaluating and reevaluating the services that we provide and try to improve those services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10649)|
| 2:57:35| and that includes looking at certain areas and seeing if we need to expand our services into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10655)|
| 2:57:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10664)|
| 2:57:45| Is there a certain population density way into that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10665)|
| 2:57:49| How does population density increase or decrease way into either police or fire service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10669)|
| 2:57:57| When we're looking at it from the fire service perspective, it's just primarily based on distances to fire stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10677)|
| 2:58:05| and that's the primary focus that we have, although it can also include the time involved to travel there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10685)|
| 2:58:16| Currently, how would you assess the services or reach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10696)|
| 2:58:22| or is this a pretty tough neighborhood to reach from our existing footprint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10702)|
| 2:58:26| I would like from a police and fire standpoint comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10706)|
| 2:58:31| So I did a little bit of research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10711)|
| 2:58:34| I just looked up reported crime or crime reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10714)|
| 2:58:37| I'm sorry, not calls for service, so I wasn't able to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10717)|
| 2:58:41| But in the past year in the Anchorage Subdivision, we've only had three reports, three theft for motor vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10721)|
| 2:58:50| We're very similar in the way we deploy resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10730)|
| 2:58:53| So we have BEATs, and our BEATs are based on geography and calls for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10733)|
| 2:58:59| The Anchorage is a little ways out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10739)|
| 2:59:01| It may take us a little longer to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10741)|
| 2:59:03| We are well aware of where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10743)|
| 2:59:05| All of our officers are well aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10745)|
| 2:59:08| My home is pretty close to that, so I'm well aware of everything that goes on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10748)|
| 2:59:14| As far as the unfortunate double fatality in the water, that's TWRA's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10754)|
| 2:59:20| Now, we do try to assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10760)|
| 2:59:22| We do not have a boat that we keep in the water, so TWRA gets there much quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10762)|
| 2:59:27| So I wanted to clear that up really quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10767)|
| 2:59:31| Did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10771)|
| 2:59:33| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10773)|
| 2:59:34| I mean, I think it makes logical sense that the more dense the population, the more services and area a community needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10774)|
| 2:59:40| As Alcoa Highway construction ends and development starts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10780)|
| 2:59:47| we're going to need to evaluate that on a more consistent or, I guess, more frequent basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10787)|
| 2:59:53| to make sure that our services sounds like we need to catch up maybe a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10793)|
| 2:59:58| or even just get ahead of additional 300, 400, 500 additional people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10798)|
| 3:00:03| So I think from a service standpoint, that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10803)|
| 3:00:06| That's something I've heard recently from that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10806)|
| 3:00:10| So I want to make sure that we stay on top of that regardless of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10810)|
| 3:00:13| I just want to comment, as it relates to the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10813)|
| 3:00:15| I do think it's important that Mr. Burr and Mrs. Proctor's comments are fully heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10815)|
| 3:00:22| in terms of the historical activity on this corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10822)|
| 3:00:29| The businesses that have died, I think I looked up population density recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10829)|
| 3:00:34| it was discussed in the Planning Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10834)|
| 3:00:39| but they've lost 17% of the population in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10839)|
| 3:00:43| And the businesses had a closure rate that was significant as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10843)|
| 3:00:47| So similar to when Chapman Highway, those small businesses suffered when we closed Henley Street Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10847)|
| 3:00:54| So major construction creates a pain point not just for the residents but for small businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10854)|
| 3:00:59| and this has dried up that entire corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10859)|
| 3:01:02| So the history as it relates to rebuilding this corridor I think is extremely important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10862)|
| 3:01:07| that we honor the years of hundreds of input from community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10867)|
| 3:01:13| about what types of things want to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10873)|
| 3:01:16| There was an East Tennessee Design Center charrette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10876)|
| 3:01:18| MPC has played a role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10878)|
| 3:01:21| Knox County Planning is going to review the area plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10881)|
| 3:01:25| And so now is the time for rebuilding Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10885)|
| 3:01:29| and I think it has to have more people living there in order to have the groceries, fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10889)|
| 3:01:37| lease services that that area needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10897)|
| 3:01:40| So there's too few people that live out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10900)|
| 3:01:43| and I think this is actually a good example of utilizing hundreds of millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10903)|
| 3:01:48| of investments in infrastructure to provide, as Mr. Burr put, transitional housing, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10908)|
| 3:01:55| from that important corridor to the residents who are not that far away now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10915)|
| 3:02:01| So I intend to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10921)|
| 3:02:03| I do want to stay on top of the services that are needed to serve this existing community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10923)|
| 3:02:09| and make sure we stay ahead of getting any further behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10929)|
| 3:02:13| and reaching the folks who live out on this neck of the woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10933)|
| 3:02:18| Thank you, Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10938)|
| 3:02:20| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10940)|
| 3:02:22| Councilmember Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10942)|
| 3:02:24| I just have a quick question about the mention of a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10944)|
| 3:02:27| Is that like a city project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10947)|
| 3:02:29| Was there some greenway connection involved in this project, or am I confused?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10949)|
| 3:02:35| I don't know about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10955)|
| 3:02:37| There's a greenway that has been a part of the Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10957)|
| 3:02:41| That road infrastructure project that's been in place for nearly two decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10961)|
| 3:02:46| pieces of that are being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10966)|
| 3:02:48| I'm not sure how that relates to the Dominion project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10968)|
| 3:02:50| but the corridor, and Mr. Burr may have more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10970)|
| 3:02:53| There's always been a desire and funding with TDOT to move that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10973)|
| 3:02:58| Okay, as part of the TDOT stuff, not as part of the Dominion project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10978)|
| 3:03:01| Okay, they referenced a greenway, and I was confused and thought it was part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10981)|
| 3:03:04| Thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=10984)|

| 3:06:56| It's your responsibility, and I think it's also the responsibility of the council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11216)|
| 3:07:01| to let people know who you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11221)|

| 3:07:40| I spoke with Beth Goodman again in follow-up of an issue that's in Councilperson Thomas'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11260)|
| 3:07:47| neighborhood, and she is just outstanding, easy to talk to, and I also would encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11267)|
| 3:07:54| folks out there listening and watching to use the 3-1-1 and get to know the CODES people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11274)|
| 3:08:01| and especially the 3-1-1 people like Sheila, and I hope she gets this compliment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11281)|
| 3:08:07| I know every single person at 3-1-1 because I call on a lot of things to improve our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11287)|
| 3:08:12| and all districts, and I found the 3-1-1 operators, especially Sheila, who I talk to quite often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11292)|
| 3:08:20| to be very friendly and very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11300)|
| 3:08:23| I want to give a shout-out to Councilwoman Ryder for listening to me in another area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11303)|

| 3:08:43| Some friends of mine talked to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11323)|
| 3:08:45| I talked to Lauren about it, and she took care of that, so I want to thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11325)|
| 3:08:52| And one other thing is the Alcoa Highway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11332)|
| 3:08:55| I've lived in different places, but the home that I have in Martha Washington Heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11335)|
| 3:09:02| I drive into Knoxville every day, and we need some help on getting the southbound side mowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11342)|

| 3:09:16| I don't know if it's city, if it's county, if it's state, but we can't see the speed limit signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11356)|

| 3:09:26| And the final thing, why don't we have a welcome to Knoxville sign, a big one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11366)|
| 3:09:31| unless I'm missing it, on Alcoa Highway, somewhere closer in my area, because people are coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11371)|

| 3:10:24| because my life, two and a half years ago, completely took a turn, just out of the blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11424)|
| 3:10:34| I was visiting my son, who was in court, and I was accused by a KPD officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11434)|
| 3:10:43| of going in an armed building, follow armed sheriff's officers, armed KPD officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11443)|
| 3:10:49| He was armed, armed court officers, armed investigators, armed district attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11449)|
| 3:10:56| and taking his wallet out of his front right pocket, out of the front left pocket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11456)|

| 3:11:20| I'm currently without utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11480)|

| 3:11:43| Two weeks ago, I was assaulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11503)|
| 3:11:46| I called for police escort out of this horrible situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11506)|

| 3:14:35| Next person signed up to speak is Tyler Gibbons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11675)|
| 3:14:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11696)|
| 3:14:57| What I have to talk about seems petty after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11697)|
| 3:15:02| Tyler Gibbons, 1823 Explorer Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11702)|
| 3:15:10| In December of 2018, Convention Sports and Leisure, or CSL, conducted a study for the Montreal Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11710)|
| 3:15:18| a group of business people seeking to bring the Expos, a major league baseball team, back to Montreal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11718)|
| 3:15:24| Today, CSL is working for a group of business people seeking to bring the Smokies back to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11724)|
| 3:15:30| CSL's study on the return of the Expos contained a major error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11730)|
| 3:15:33| It did not consider the exchange rate when comparing the income of Montrealers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11733)|
| 3:15:37| with the income of residents of other major ballpark markets in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11737)|
| 3:15:42| The result, instead of being in the middle of the pack among the baseball markets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11742)|
| 3:15:46| Montreal was ranked second to last once they corrected the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11746)|
| 3:15:50| Given the failure on an easy currency conversion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11750)|
| 3:15:54| I'm not sure we can trust CSL to handle the cost fluctuations of a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11754)|
| 3:16:00| This wasn't the first or only major error by CSL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11760)|
| 3:16:03| In 2013, a study estimated the benefits of the D.C. United Soccer Stadium in Washington, D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11763)|
| 3:16:10| CSL mistakenly counted a land transfer between city agencies as a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11770)|
| 3:16:16| The original estimate of benefits was $109 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11776)|
| 3:16:22| After correcting the error, the benefits were only about $38 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11782)|
| 3:16:27| I believe our stadium funding plan also involves some significant land transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11787)|
| 3:16:33| When I asked Stephanie Welch, Knoxville's chief development officer, how CSL was chosen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11793)|
| 3:16:37| she claimed they were vetted thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11797)|
| 3:16:40| Ms. Welch had no idea about either of these study incidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11800)|
| 3:16:44| and could not recall a single study where CSL had shown a negative economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11804)|
| 3:16:49| Mayor Kincannon told me that she was pretty sure that CSL was not the company that was chosen to do the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11809)|
| 3:16:56| How are we supposed to trust our executive leadership if they fail to research the company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11816)|
| 3:17:02| supporting their claim that this baseball stadium project will be good for Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11822)|
| 3:17:07| How are we supposed to trust leadership if they don't even know who our contractors are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11827)|
| 3:17:12| The $65 million figure being thrown around is from a Boyd Sports funded study for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11832)|
| 3:17:18| I think we can expect the $65 million figure to be low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11838)|
| 3:17:22| It also leaves out the cost of financing the interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11842)|
| 3:17:25| As any homeowner knows, the amount you pay back on a mortgage is well more than your sticker price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11845)|
| 3:17:32| At 4% over 30 years, the cost of financing for this stadium would be over $30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11852)|
| 3:17:38| The public safety building experienced cost overruns of $20 million, or 43%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11858)|
| 3:17:44| Ms. Welch also misremembered this figure as a 20% overrun, but that is a very easy mistake to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11864)|
| 3:17:50| 20%, $20 million, easy confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11870)|
| 3:17:53| Failing to vet the bidders in an RFP should not be an easy mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11873)|
| 3:17:58| I emailed the mayor's official account with the information I've discussed here after she professed her ignorance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11878)|
| 3:18:04| and then tried to convince me that CSL was not the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11884)|
| 3:18:07| I have not received a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11887)|
| 3:18:09| Likewise, Deputy Welch told me on camera that she would be happy to answer additional questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11889)|
| 3:18:14| outside of the meet and greet under the bridge in the Old City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11894)|
| 3:18:18| She, likewise, has not responded to my email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11898)|
| 3:18:23| I had a couple other things I wanted to discuss, but again, it's just being petty after the last person to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11903)|
| 3:18:29| You know, discuss all the various failures of the various agencies of this city in such a personal manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11909)|
| 3:18:36| But I would also like to mention a couple other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11916)|
| 3:18:38| First, I'd like to mention the ban on profanity in this assembly that the mayor mentioned in her report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11918)|
| 3:18:43| which perhaps has been a policy for a while, but I don't remember hearing it previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11923)|
| 3:18:47| In Cohen v. California in 1971, Justice John Marshall Harlan II reasoned that, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11927)|
| 3:18:55| while the particular four-letter word being litigated here is perhaps more distasteful than most of the others of its genre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11935)|
| 3:19:04| it is nevertheless often true that one man's vulgarity is another's lyric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11944)|
| 3:19:08| Justice Harlan went on to say, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11948)|
| 3:19:11| Governments might soon seize upon the censorship of particular words as a convenient guise for branding the expression of unpopular views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11951)|
| 3:19:19| End quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11959)|
| 3:19:21| I would recommend that this chamber take Justice Harlan's legal counsel and decision making to heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11961)|
| 3:19:28| Also, I'd like to point out that the Aramark team brought four white-collar salespeople and managers to this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11968)|
| 3:19:34| but they claim they cannot afford $15 an hour for temporary laborers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11974)|
| 3:19:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11978)|
| 3:19:41| Okay, next person signed up to speak on public forum is Harold Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11981)|
| 3:19:51| I have a different hat on at this moment, and there may be a tendency in the future to put a clock on me even when I'm sitting over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11991)|
| 3:19:59| But tonight I'm speaking to you as the chair of the board for the East Tennessee Valley Crime Stoppers Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=11999)|
| 3:20:07| Earlier tonight, Mayor King Cannon shared that we have doubled the typical reward that's being offered in the most recent shooting here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12007)|
| 3:20:20| the most recent murder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12020)|
| 3:20:24| When each of the board members began this journey, and I think this is what I owe you all an exclamation on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12024)|
| 3:20:31| One is that we wanted to create a safe place that anyone in this community could provide a tip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12031)|
| 3:20:41| that could lead to the arrest of someone who has done harm in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12041)|
| 3:20:46| In the midst of that, our hope is that that pipeline might be a deterrent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12046)|
| 3:20:53| that folks would see that it is being used and that there are rewards taking place and that people are being taken off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12053)|
| 3:21:02| Quite frankly, the catalyst for most of the board members being on at this time has been the death of these high school kids, these young men and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12062)|
| 3:21:12| It eats at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12072)|
| 3:21:15| And if you came to a board meeting, that's the first question that comes out, is what is the status of bringing these murderers to justice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12075)|
| 3:21:25| We had one, Miss Muhammad, 15 years old, February the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12085)|
| 3:21:33| We yet to have a viable lead in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12093)|
| 3:21:38| And yet there were numerous people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12098)|
| 3:21:42| March 9th, Mr. Gillette, there weren't numerous people there, 15 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12102)|
| 3:21:49| We also have a reward in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12109)|
| 3:21:53| And then the most recent one in chief, even though I know it's in the press,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12113)|
| 3:21:57| I'm not going to state the student's name because I don't think it's been officially released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12117)|
| 3:22:01| Is that a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12121)|
| 3:22:04| If counsel would indulge me, 17-year-old male, young man in our community at Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12124)|
| 3:22:13| And you will see tonight on the news, there is a picture where there are numerous people at the event that took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12133)|
| 3:22:22| The numbers will surprise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12142)|
| 3:22:24| Quite frankly, the photograph surprised me more than the numbers, so I encourage you to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12144)|
| 3:22:30| At our July board meeting, one of the things that we discussed, it was both a board meeting and a planning session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12150)|
| 3:22:37| was to consider, and we were going to be considering at our next board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12157)|
| 3:22:43| should we put a multiplier on the formula that Crime Stoppers uses for violence, for murder, for exploitation, for trafficking of our kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12163)|
| 3:22:57| And there is a unanimous heart that that's the direction we should pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12177)|
| 3:23:04| However, after what happened this past Sunday, we called an emergency board meeting today to do just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12184)|
| 3:23:12| To hopefully create an incentive for folks who were at that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12192)|
| 3:23:18| And frankly, an incentive for Ms. Gillette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12198)|
| 3:23:21| We already have $2,500 for her based on the gracious donations of an anonymous giver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12201)|
| 3:23:27| Our hope is that that might be a little bit of an incentive for someone at that event to check us out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12207)|
| 3:23:36| and to trust that we have come up with a safe place that is confidential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12216)|
| 3:23:41| and that the reward system, the way they get that, is confidential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12221)|
| 3:23:46| Vice Mayor McKenzie, I think your words were, somebody that you were with earlier this year is, enough is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12226)|
| 3:23:54| And that is the heart of our board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12234)|
| 3:23:58| That is why we're taking the steps that we're taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12238)|
| 3:24:01| At the risk of sounding like a sales pitch, if someone wants to lock arms and contribute to these or other crimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12241)|
| 3:24:08| I would love to raise that reward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12248)|
| 3:24:11| But that's not why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12251)|
| 3:24:14| That's not why I'm here at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12254)|
| 3:24:16| We're committed to locking arms with this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12256)|
| 3:24:21| and addressing these crimes that have already taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12261)|
| 3:24:26| If you will, and it's cliche, bring justice to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12266)|
| 3:24:30| And begin to provide a safe place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12270)|
| 3:24:35| Get the folks off the street who are a threat to our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12275)|
| 3:24:38| Provide a safe place in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12278)|
| 3:24:43| We appreciate the opportunity to be a part of Crime Stoppers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12283)|
| 3:24:46| We appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12286)|
| 3:24:49| And I thank you for this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12289)|
| 3:24:52| Thank you, Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12292)|
| 3:24:54| Council members, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12294)|
| 3:24:56| And without objection, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210810?start=12296)|
