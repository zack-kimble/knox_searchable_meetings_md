| 0:00:46| I stand as we observe a moment of silence, followed by the pledge, led by Ms. Spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=46)|
| 0:01:01| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=61)|
| 0:01:06| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=66)|

| 0:01:39| So, we wish her well in her game tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=99)|
| 0:01:42| I'm excited to hear how that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=102)|
| 0:01:45| Do we have any requested changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=105)|
| 0:01:49| If not, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=109)|
| 0:01:51| Motion by Ms. Horne, second by Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=111)|
| 0:01:53| All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| And I do believe we're going to start off with a special recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=118)|
| 0:02:02| Dr. Wilson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=122)|
| 0:02:05| Yes, thank you. I'm actually going to kick that to Jim Allen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=125)|
| 0:02:08| the principal from L&N STEM Academy, to do an introduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| and share a little bit about what we're recognizing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| Thank you, Keith, and thank you, the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| I want to recognize one of our students tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| and it was a really great honor to be able to be asked to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| The student that we're recognizing took part in the Congressional App Challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| which is an official initiative by the U.S. House of Representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| where members of Congress host contests in their districts for middle and high school students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| encouraging them to learn to code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| and inspiring them to pursue careers in computer science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| This initiative supports and emphasizes those critical, important pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| that we emphasize as a school in STEM and in our rapidly evolving world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| This year's contest had 11,334 students from across the U.S.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=171)|
| 0:02:57| marking an impressive increase of almost 1,000 more participants than the previous year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| and so some really exciting things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| There were 3,645 original applications submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| so not groups, individual projects put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| indicating a remarkable growth in that town and our whole country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| and many more in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=195)|
| 0:03:17| So each participating member of Congress selected a winning app for their district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| Each winning team was invited to showcase their winning app to Congress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| during the annual House of Code Festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| which is a program that is a private and public partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| a really neat thing happening in D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| When Ellen and STEM Academy student Dominic Pelea, who's over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| was selected by Congressman Burchett as Tennessee's 2023 Congressional App Challenge winner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=219)|
| 0:03:45| he had submitted an app called ReMemory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| Dominic's words were that he was motivated to create the app by his grandfather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| who suffered from dementia, and also his grandmother, who takes care of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| The app supports iPad, iPhone, and on the Mac,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| and is meant to help those with Alzheimer's or dementia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| along with their caregivers, to combat memory loss and cognitive impairment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| The app provides activities for the brain, medication tracking, progress reports, resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| among many other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| And I can't describe to you just how impressive it is to see Dominic having done this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| let alone in the ninth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| Our students are impressive, and Dominic stands out amongst that even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| and that was a really incredible thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| So it's my honor to join the board, Superintendent Reiswick, and everybody else here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| in recognizing Dominic for not only winning the app challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| but for creating something that was going to help our community and the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=284)|
| 0:05:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=314)|
| 0:05:42| Mr. Allen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| What's the name of the app again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| It's ReMemory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=349)|
| 0:05:56| Madam Chair, a point of personal privilege, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| I want to say, and the young man is leaving now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| but I want to say that thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| When I was 18 years old, my grandmother died from complications of dementia, 1978,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=368)|
| 0:06:17| and I was her caregiver during the summer as much as I could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| That was my senior year going off to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| And then in 2020, after about 12 years, my mother passed away, complications of dementia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=385)|
| 0:06:36| So I know the need that is for those who suffer with this disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=396)|
| 0:06:43| and then also those caregivers who do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| So thank you so much at this early age caring for people enough to put that in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=406)|
| 0:07:00| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| And thank you, Reverend Butler, for sharing those words about your family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| Next on our agenda, we will have a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| I'll refer to Dr. Reiswig on the library collection management presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| I appreciate you putting this together, and I know your staff has worked really hard on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| Thank you very much, and thanks for asking for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| I know Ms. Sarah Searles is going to come up and speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| So as she's coming up, I just want to take a minute just to echo what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| Really, the work of our librarians and the importance of our librarians in our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| just the purpose that they play and just the exposure they give to our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| to open their minds to lots of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| We really, really are thankful for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| And above them, we really are thankful for Sarah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| You know, those of you who have gotten to know her, just her ability to navigate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| which I'll say is very tough places sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| There's lots of feelings about things like library books and all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| She does a great job of keeping our kids at the center and at heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| and keeping a great balance of what keeps our kids safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| as well as what gets them exposed to different ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| So we're just very appreciative of you, and thank you for talking about how we do library collections today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| And I do want to say, I know we have several speakers on this topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| so I think we'll have them after Sarah, after you do your presentation, we'll have them speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| Because I know there's several students, and just to be respectful for their time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| in case they want to head out after that, if that's okay with everybody, the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| All right. Hi, Sarah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| Hi. Well, thank you, Madam Chair, Dr. Reisswick, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| I just want to start by particularly thanking you for the opportunity to speak today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| because this has been a national conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| And locally, it's been marked by really a commitment from, I think, the people in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=523)|
| 0:08:50| to lean in on our relationships and to make sure that we're always learning about the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| and really considering it carefully and finding the best solution for our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| which is a testament to the strength of our district's leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| And so I'm deeply appreciative of the opportunity to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| I'm proud to work for the Knox County Schools and grateful to be able to share in this conversation tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=546)|
| 0:09:13| So libraries, I think part of the mystery is that they have long operated as sort of a background memory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=553)|
| 0:09:25| for many of us, and that's really been kind of fueled by nostalgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| But what's happening with this national conversation going on is it's really awakening a lot of unknowns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| and a lot of uncertainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| We suddenly realize we don't know a lot about where these decisions come from and how they get made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| So my goal is to offer you transparency tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| And by talking about these three things, we want to talk about school libraries' mission and purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| what it is that we're here for, collection development and management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| really just how that works, kind of a peek under the hood at a high level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| and some opportunities that we feel like we've got for improvement in our process through the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=597)|
| 0:10:05| especially by increasing engagement from our stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=605)|
| 0:10:12| When we talk about our mission and our purpose, I think the number one misconception about libraries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| is that they are about books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| The truth is they are about people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| And that's important because otherwise what are those books for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| So what you're seeing on the screen there are some excerpts from our most recent working vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| School libraries are dynamic centers designed to welcome, motivate and inspire the entire school community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=633)|
| 0:10:39| Our goal is to develop a culture of innovation, achievement and collaboration in every library in every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| Crucial to understanding school libraries, if we look at those italicized phrases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| the entire school community in every library in every school is that libraries are not only about people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| they're about a lot of people, which is a complex system to balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=655)|
| 0:11:01| And so our commitment in that complex system is that at its root, school libraries exist to inform and empower students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=661)|
| 0:11:12| We do that through our instructional programming and research and inquiry instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| our collections of resources in a wide variety of formats, our facilities as gathering places and incubators of ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=677)|
| 0:11:25| And we are committed through all of that work to creating and maintaining safe and engaging environments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| where students can think, create, share and grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| We do that because it's the best work of libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| And more importantly, we do that because it's right for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=697)|
| 0:11:47| Libraries have a reputation for being kind of stolid institutions, but they are living organisms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| Our collections are ever-changing to meet the unique needs and interests of our students and our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=713)|
| 0:12:00| This is a thing that we know most library collections are inherited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| Our staff will change, our curriculum will change, the high-demand skill sets of our graduates will change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| the funding structures and sources that we're working with will change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| the popular authors and series of what goes on the shelf will change, publishers' trends will change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| and even the cultural influences impacting our children's choices will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| So we know that that's a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| This is built into the structure of libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| They will live and they will grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| But there are three things that we want to assure the families and students of Knox County can expect as constants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| that they can expect from every school in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=755)|
| 0:12:42| In Knox County, our libraries will be managed by highly qualified, trained professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| Our school collections will be safe, inclusive, age-appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| and our collections will be tailored to meet the unique needs of each school community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| These are things we believe in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| They're things we're committed to upholding as study values across our broad and complex district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=779)|
| 0:13:12| I want to talk a little bit about who our school librarians are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| I think this is very important to understand in this national conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| that not every district has the advantages that we have in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| in terms of the staffing and the support structure that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| Since we do have these blessings available to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| we are ambitious that we want to create the best quality school libraries possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| So in Knox County, every school library is managed by a trained professional with a teaching license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=814)|
| 0:13:41| These are educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| Every one of them has a master's degree or higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| They have extra qualifications beyond what we expect of the entry level for teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| and they have a content area endorsement on their license in library media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| So they have a minimum of 21 graduate coursework hours in the specifics of managing a school library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=835)|
| 0:14:03| Their duties include managing the collections, for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| also delivering research and inquiry instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| and supporting classroom instruction and programming all across their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| They also work with individual students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| and so they're responsible to create a safe and guided library experience for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| We're very blessed here that our librarians are able to participate in ongoing professional development as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| specific to libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| That's a unique advantage of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| in standards-based instruction and best practices in collection management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=870)|
| 0:14:40| This is a look at the collection development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| It's going to fall in four main stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| The first of those is going to be needs assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| where they're going to identify gaps in the collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| They're going to look at requests that people have put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| They're going to look at the curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| at interactions with teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| at observations they've made of people as they interact with the collection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| and they're going to identify all those areas to better serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| They're going to develop a strategy based on looking at their collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| and figuring out what it is that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| At that point, they go to the selection and acquisition stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| That's where they're going to look at those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| They're going to go through catalogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| They're going to review professional sources to identify a variety of resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| that are going to meet those identified needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| obviously within the funding available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| That can be an interesting puzzle sometimes to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| Librarians love that challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| Step three is access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| which is not actually about the purchasing process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| but it is critical to collection development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| That's where you do all the things that are visible on books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| You apply the spine labels and the barcodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| Certainly you put them on the shelf, but also you design your signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| and you figure out where in the facility the different sections will go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| All of those access pieces are going to affect how people use the collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| and whether the items that you've got are actually useful to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| In that stage four, evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| this is where you're going to consider the collection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| especially given that, as we said, collections are inherited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| Sometimes things reach the end of their usable life for one reason or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| Librarians will sit down, they'll look at the balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| they'll look at what has come in, they'll look at usage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| they'll look at how it's really meeting the needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| and they'll make the decision about what needs to exit the collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| We do that for the same reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| We call it weeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| We do it for the same reasons as you would weed a garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| It's not about what you're removing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| it's about what you're making room for so that it can grow and thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| These things are a circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| They go around and around, and that's important to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| because you don't ever get done with that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| Each stage is going to affect the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| Sometimes you move backwards because that's how the workflow goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| I think it's very important at this stage to look at that note in the center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| that's relevant to this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| At any point in time, if a librarian, just in the course of their work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| realizes that they need to stop and evaluate something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| they do in the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| Sometimes something will just catch your eye on the shelf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| and you think, that one's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| Or a student will turn something in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| or you'll realize it as part of a conversation with a teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| We do want to make sure the board knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| that whenever something is not right for a collection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| librarians look at that as part of their regular and ongoing duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| That can be something that we can handle as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| We know we need some clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| because this has been part of the questions that have been asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| about what happens when a book is challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| We know, we believe, that our collection development process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| that we've been discussing is robust and high quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| but as with anything involving humans, it has some subjectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| Our board policy, you can see on the sidebar there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| actually even calls that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| with this Because Opinions Differ clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| Sometimes you make a choice and then you look at it later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| and there may be some questions about that choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| and that's why we have the challenge process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| The national conversation around us has had some heated rhetoric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| about book banning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| One thing I have really appreciated about our board's conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| over the last two years is that what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| is reviewing books for age appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| and best fit to school communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| From the perspective of Knox County School staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| that's what we want too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| We want to see the best outcome for our school audiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| and we want to ensure our students are taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| We respect the fact that collections naturally grow and change over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| and a thoughtful reconsideration process is just part of that cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| If we're doing high quality work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| high quality work includes room for rethinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| When that comes to book challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| books can be challenged for a variety of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| There's a whole gamut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| We've seen anything from concerns that a material is just too scary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| for a given audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| all the way to the other extreme of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| is material too explicit or obscene?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| What I would want to assure everyone is that in our district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| every concern is treated seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| Every effort will be made to resolve the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| as close as possible to the student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1187)|
| 0:19:55| With more specifics about what happens in that challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| our current process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| step one is going to be always to make an effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| to resolve concerns individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| What that looks like is it's just going to mirror anything else in the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| where there may be a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| Staff in our schools are always going to want to partner with parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| to work out what's best for their child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| An example of that specifically to library concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| in the late 90s, early 2000s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| there was a growing concern with a then newly popular series| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| called Harry Potter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| The concern was that children would learn witchcraft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| and that this was in opposition to deeply held religious beliefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| That would have been a case where a librarian would have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1244)|
| 0:20:51| in terms of individual revolutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| a librarian would have been happy to talk to that parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| and ensure that that particular child doesn't have access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| to that particular title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| and make some offers to guide them to a better choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| If there was ever a case where a parent had this concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| and a child said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| but I like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| it's part of the librarian's expertise to be able to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| what do you like about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| Because we can find you something else that has those qualities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| That's part of what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| They want to create safe spaces for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| When we can't work it out individually in that manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| our I-212 policy and procedure are what govern that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| The big step there, it's multiple steps in API 212,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| but essentially we would form a school-level committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| to review that material if the concern cannot be resolved individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| That school-level committee would make a decision if needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| or desired on the point of the person with the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| That can be elevated in step three to a district-level committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| to review that material again if it's not resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| The end of that district-level committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| is to make a recommendation to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| and the final decision on any instructional material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| of course, rests with the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| One thing that has been new in the last couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| with the Age Appropriate Materials Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| is that there's now a process for appealing those decisions to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| if the matter is still not resolved at the district level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| Our policy does inform individuals of their right to do so if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1350)|
| 0:22:40| As we review this, we feel good about the solid work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| that has been done on our reconsideration process in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| That I-212 procedure hasn't actually changed much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| in revision cycles over the last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| and we feel that's a pretty good sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| about the fairness and the balance that it represents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| But, of course, in Knox County, we're always interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| in how we can improve our systems to better serve our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| This conversation has been an excellent opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| to stop and take a close look and make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| that our practice is as strong as it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| Through that process, we've identified some opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| to improve and engage more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| We recognize that we can do more to get those voices at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| and we want to commit to that growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| We'll talk a little bit about what we currently like in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| and then what we want to commit to in those improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1410)|
| 0:23:38| What we like about that current review process that we've just talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| is that it allows decisions to be made at the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| that's closest to our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| We believe that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| That thing number one is knowing our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| and that decisions need to be made right there where our knowledge is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| We also like that it's narrowly tailored to specific concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| We can zoom in on exactly which materials are causing discomfort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| and treat those at a granular level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| It's also responsive to the distinct needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| of our individual school communities by starting at that building level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| because we recognize that different parts of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| may have different needs and different pressures and influences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| that are impacting how a collection needs to look for each of those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1461)|
| 0:24:29| Where we want to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| It is clear that Knox County Schools families want to be included in this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| and we love that because inclusion is one of those values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| that on an earlier slide we just committed to holding constant for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| We want our families involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| and we know that the work will always be stronger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| when we have multiple perspectives in the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| We also recognize that this complex work is a big lift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| for each building's individual librarian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| so by harnessing the network power available in KCS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| again one of the unique advantages that we have as a large district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| we believe we can take better care of our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| and keep their time and energy where it belongs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| which is taking care of our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| So how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| We'd like to launch two new elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| to add to our collection development and management process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| We're looking at the formation of school library councils| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| and sensitive title review committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| We believe these two elements will strengthen our processes now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| and also for the long run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| because we want to make sure all the people we support now and in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| are taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| The school library councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| What we're looking at is creating small groups at each building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| five to seven stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| There will be some room for customization for each building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| because they all have different staffing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| but we expect that to usually look like a librarian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| a principal or their administrative designee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| a classroom teacher, a school counselor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| and at least one parent or guardian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| We think there's room given a school's needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| to maybe double up on some of those roles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| and just make sure that this looks like how the school needs it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| What this group will be engaged in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| is really thinking about those processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| in that collection development management cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| identifying library needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| collaborating on what those new titles should be as they're added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| collaborating on what that removal looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| as they get to the evaluation stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| and especially deciding on recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| from the sensitive title review committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| which we'll talk about in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| When we look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| the librarians will remain the expert curators in our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| We're not trying to usurp that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| But we recognize that formalizing the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| of including stakeholder input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| which is something our librarians have always done anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| but this will formalize it and make sure we're doing it with equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| we think that we will arrive at a richer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| and more robust service for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| And this engagement at these different points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| is going to allow us a couple of different places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| to get more perspectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| especially on some strategy for aligning funding to needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| since that is always tricky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| Looking at how collections grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| and that includes donations as well as purchases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| making room, sometimes physical room, in the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| A lot of schools are interested in renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| in their libraries as a community space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| so how do we do that to serve new and emerging needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| And also to make sure that any guidance we provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| at the district level is going to be implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| in a locally responsive and school-specific way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| So that district-level guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| is where the sensitive title review committee comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| So we're aware that certain titles are considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1686)|
| 0:28:13| especially sensitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| and those come especially in the areas of drugs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| sex, violence, language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| These are things that are known in the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| and those titles require complex decision-making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| in a library collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| So what we want to do is form a committee structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| that will support that complex decision-making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| What we're looking at is three committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| These will be composed as librarians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| as expert curators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| There will be a group of five at each grade level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| so one from each region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| at elementary, middle, and high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| So 15 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| And these folks will be responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| for a proactive process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| of reading and evaluating titles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| that may be sensitive in their content| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| on a schedule that would be established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| and facilitated by my staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| as a district-level support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| What these folks will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| through their work reading and evaluating these titles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| is they'll be responsible to make a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| that will then pass down to the school library councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| They'll make a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| about how a sensitive title would be handled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| but that's at the district level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| We hope that this will take the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| but the decision then will push down to the building level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| for these school library councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| So those school library councils will be able to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| whether to follow that district-level recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| or if they don't feel it's a good fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| for their school community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| then they will be that much better informed then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| to send that title through their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| formal reconsideration process at the building level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| through our existing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| Our challenge to these review committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| is to provide an unbiased evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| to the school library councils| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| so that each of them can make a strong decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| about keeping or removing any books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| Our goal is to grow capacity in the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| for supporting complex decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| so that we can take care of everyone involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| and that's our families, and that's our staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| and that's most especially our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| who may encounter these titles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| We hope this structure will provide support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| from the district level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| but feed it down to the school level for action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| We also hope it's going to harness our librarians' expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| and honor what they bring to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| but feeding that decision-making back to multiple stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| and ensuring that we have all those views represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1846)|
| 0:30:56| What we hope for is that by adding these two committee structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| to our full cycle of how collections are developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| and managed in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| we see this as beneficial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| because it's a proactive approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| Our existing processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| while we believe they've been robust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| they've been reactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| They've waited for a concern to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| This gives us a chance to really increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| the amount of weight that we're putting on that evaluation process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| and make sure that we have good thinking on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| We like that it shifts some of the workload| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| and the decision-making from individuals toward groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| We know that one of the truths of working in public education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| is that our staff is overstretched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| We hope this will be a valuable support to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| and help them feel supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| It helps by adding more perspectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| to that development and review processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| which we believe is critical for partnering effectively with our families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| which we know is the place where we want to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| We believe we can do all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| while remaining responsive to each unique school community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| and ensuring that each building gets what it needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1924)|
| 0:32:12| In summary, I think it's important to note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| that this complexity that we're talking about isn't new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| It's just the nature of the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| It is how libraries are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| But it is an excellent opportunity for us to take a close look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| and see how we can improve in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| Because of that complexity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| there will be times where we need to remove titles from a collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| There will also be times where we receive complaints or concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| and those titles will not exit the collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| If we've done our job right with an unbiased review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| we believe we will catch each of those cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| And regardless of the outcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| we will always take those concerns seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| review them appropriately to the best of our ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| because we're committed to creating those safe and engaging environments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| for all students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| and title review is a valued part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| We want to make sure that every member of our school community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| is treated with the attention and the dignity that they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| So we are excited for this opportunity moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| to involve more voices and perspectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| and be more proactive in that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| Our immediate next steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| so that you can know what to expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| We are starting this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| We're going to be doing the planning for the school library councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| We want to make sure that we have put, to the best of our ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| some protocols and things together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| so that we can support schools as they form those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| We're also going to be piloting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| the sensitive title review committee process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| These are three books that we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| for the three grade levels to test the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| These are just titles that we're aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| whose content is considered sensitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| and they're all considered sensitive for different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| So we hope this is going to give us a good sample view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| of how the sensitive title review process will work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| in a variety of cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| as we see how that work may take shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| Over the summer, our professional development for librarians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| will be focused on collection evaluation and weeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| As we start next year, we'll look at actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| forming those councils,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| fully launching the sensitive title review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| and of course continued professional development as those needs emerge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| What questions might you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| Thank you, Sarah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| Board members, do we want to have the public forum speakers come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| and we can listen to what, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| we could direct questions to you after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| Sarah, does that sound okay? I know this is more of a unique situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| since it's a presentation with speakers versus a voting item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| Does that sound okay with you, board members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| I do have some specific questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| just for her about this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| I don't know if we're talking after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| I was thinking that the public forum speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| could come up and speak so we could hear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| And then we could have our discussion and Sarah will still be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| and we can direct questions to the process and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| So we will have a discussion for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| Thanks, Sarah. You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| To be continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| So we have several public forum speakers. Stacy Reese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| If you will come up and state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| and county of residence and you will have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2143)|
| 0:35:54| Hello again. I'm Dr. Stacy Reese and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| One of my students informed me last week with my public forum speech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| from December and made its way onto a group's homepage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| They also pointed out the logical fallacies apparent in that video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| such as red herrings and ad hominem attacks, but that's neither here nor there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| Upon looking at the page, I stumbled across a value section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| which had four things listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| One of those was we build relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| That caused me to wonder relationships with whom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| The video in question denigrates Knox County's teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| for not building relationships with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| Maybe it's there, but I haven't seen any outreach to other parents groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| so I can't say relationships are built there either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| So I'm still wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| Further surfing the site led me to a better books page for KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| An avid reader myself, I wanted to see what that list entailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| What I found were books that were written by conservative Christian authors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| supporting Western religious ideas and propaganda filled in on fiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| written by far right leaning conservative authors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| and even Fox News correspondents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| One book in particular caught my eye, a children's book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| titled The Plot Against the King, 2000 Mules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| This story is about a kingdom plot to elect Sleepy Joe over King Donald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| I am 100% certain that my child will not read this book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| because it's based in falsehoods and name calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| I'm also 100% certain that I would never ask for this book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| to be removed from a library because that's limiting access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| If I don't want my son to read a book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| he won't read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| It's that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| I would never deny access to books to other people's children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| because that's an overstep of my role as a parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| I'm responsible for parenting my child, not all of Knox County's children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| A six month longitudinal study conducted in 2022-23| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| found that students' reading scores increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| after educators added diverse books to classroom libraries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| an average of three points higher than the national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| Classrooms that added bilingual titles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| and titles representing the LGBTQ plus community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| had the greatest growth in student reading scores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| averaging anywhere from 4.5 to 7 points higher than the national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| Student reading time increased by an average of four hours per week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| after educators added new diverse books to their classroom libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| 70% of students more often chose books to read that served as mirrors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| in which they could read about characters and experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| that reflected their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| I can respect these ideas where the people are coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| It's a place of genuine concern for their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| I am just like them in that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| What I can't get behind is a politically motivated agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| and unwillingness to compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| Those who created a nationally circulated book ban guidance document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| that contains disinformation and the web curators for book looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| don't know Knox Countians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| This doesn't have to be an us versus them issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| We all want what's best for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| Let's make Knox County the model for compassion and collaboration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| for the entire nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| Free people read freely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| Again, you are all welcome in my classroom at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| Sadie Barrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| Sadie, if you'll state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| I'm Sadie Barrington and I'm in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| Good evening, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| My name is Sadie Barrington and I'm a current senior at West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| I'm the president of the Library Ambassadors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| which is a group that works closely with our school librarian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| and West students to promote the library and its resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| I'm here today to discuss how completely removing books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| in Knox County high schools would restrict diverse perspectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| and invalidate students' real life experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| Books in literature provide readers with a chance to explore perspectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| that differ from their own, while mirrors allow readers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| to see themselves through the texts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| It's vital for students to feel represented in literature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| and it is equally important for them to understand viewpoints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| and ways of life that go beyond their experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| West High School's website declares its goal to foster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| quote, open-minded and caring young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| However, book banning deprives students of the chance to explore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| the experiences of others and of their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| The majority of books that are currently facing bans across the nation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| surround topics such as sexuality, abuse and inequality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| Banning these books does not erase the fact that even students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| grapple with these experiences and deserve to receive support in literature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| One of the most common arguments about these books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| is that they are sexually explicit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| However, according to the American Library Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| the inclusion of sexual content in a book does not automatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| make the book legally harmful to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| The American Library Association also states that the legal test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| for obscenity emphasizes how works need to be reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| as a whole in order to determine what is legally obscene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| Because of this, understanding the context of a work is vital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| For example, George M. Johnson's 2020 memoir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| All Boys Aren't Blue, is targeted for ages 16 and older,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| an age range that includes half the student population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| at West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| The book explores Johnson's personal experiences as a queer person of colour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| The sections of the text that are labelled as sexually explicit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| are not intended to encourage promiscuity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| rather they are included by the author to honestly depict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| significant moments from their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| These scenes do include sexual experiences, but their context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| is one of trauma, growth and recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| Banning books that explore controversial topics such as these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| prevents students from finding comfort and representation in literature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| These experiences are real and impact students as much as adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| These scenes only constitute a small portion of the overall story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| which is the case in many of the books that groups across the nation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| are attempting to ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| Texts that highlight the voices of underrepresented groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| and that touch on controversial topics provide an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| for students who resonate with the themes to find their mirror in the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| I believe it's crucial to consider how the overarching messages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| of the books on the banned book list could impact high school students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| If a book has the potential to help a student feel valued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| accepted and understood, I strongly advocate for its inclusion in the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2518)|

| 0:42:04| Amelia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| Amelia, if you will state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| you'll also have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| Thank you. I'm Amelia Bumpus and I'm with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| Hello, my name is Amelia Bumpus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| and I am another member of the West High School Library Ambassadors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| I want to demonstrate the importance of context by reading an excerpt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| from a book available in every Knox County school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| So the man seized his concubine and put her out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| They wantonly raped her and abused her all through the night until morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| And as the dawn began to break, they let her go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| As the morning appeared, the woman came and fell down at the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| of the man's house where her master was until it was light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| When he had entered his house, he took a knife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| and grasping his concubine, he cut her into 12 pieces, limb by limb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| I don't think most of you would argue that because the Holy Bible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| contains this passage from Judges and other violent and sexual content,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| that the Bible should be banned from our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| The comfort and guidance some find in the Bible as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| outweighs certain disturbing verses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| This is an example of the importance of context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| It is the same with some of the books you have seen excerpts from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| Taken as a whole, these books have value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| and can help high school students process their own experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| Did you know that the suicide rate for teenagers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| is more than double in certain communities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| Books tell us that we are not alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| Parents who have raised their teens with a strong moral foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| and the ability to think freely should not be scared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| that a book could undermine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| It's disingenuous to think that teens aren't exposed to far more graphic content| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| through other types of media, specifically the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| Please take this opportunity to show students what our freedoms mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| not to engage in censorship and government overreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2631)|
| 0:43:59| Adriana, if you'll state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| I'm Adriana Aguilar and I'm in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| Hello, I'm Adriana Aguilar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| I'm a library ambassador at West High School as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| I'm here to talk about the effect of banning books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| Banning books with sexual content will not stop teenagers from engaging in sexual activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| More restrictions won't fix these problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| and in fact, it's more likely that they will just turn to a different source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| that could be potentially dangerous or harmful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| For these reasons, sexual education is incredibly important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| to the safety of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| In addition to the lack of information on sexuality and gender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| high school is a time of exploration and learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| Getting out of high school with no sexual or romantic knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| leads to an underdeveloped adulthood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| Considering this, there should be more sexual resources available to teens in high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| According to Education Week, 17% of banned books in 2022| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| detailed teen pregnancy and sexual abuse and assault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| How do we expect teens to avoid or know about these life-altering things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| and how to prevent them without information regarding it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| According to Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| pregnant youth aged 15-17 reported a much higher drug use than non-pregnant youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| National Library of Medicine also states that the pregnant youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| have a higher suicide rate than non-pregnant youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| Banning books will increase teen pregnancy, teen suicide, and drug use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| As a result,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| and also allow for the possibility of students to be harassed by strangers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| supposed friends or mentors, and even family members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| without the knowledge available on how to handle these situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| or if the situations are even something to be worried about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| This gives predators a large hand in taking advantage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| and manipulating students that don't have access to this necessary information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| The ban also targets minority groups all around the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| It's no coincidence that these groups have a higher rate of teen pregnancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| due to the lack of resources available to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| according to the Office of Population Affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| Also important, most teens aren't aware of their sexual orientation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| or how you can get hurt doing unsafe sexual practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| These books provide helpful tips on self-pleasure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| which prevents teens from accidental self-harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| Having sexual outlets is healthy, not something to restrict or demonize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| Teenagers are stressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| Taking away outlets prevents a healthy release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| It's strange how focused people are on censoring these types of books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| that would help students practice safe sex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| You were doing these exact things as a teenager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| looking at similar material and masturbating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| It is part of growing as a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| Allowing outlets for teens will prevent injuries and decrease teen pregnancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| Please consider this before passing this bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2796)|

| 0:46:52| Tonight I'll be discussing the negative impacts of book banning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| on the circulation of ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| using U.S. court rulings and the United Nations'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| Universal Declaration of Human Rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| the so-called roadmap for freedom and equality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| Banning books undermines both a student's intellectualism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| and their ability to participate in a democratic society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| Without exposure to varied topics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| students face susceptibility to misinformation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| and a lack of knowledge to prepare them for adulthood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| The 2009 court case American Amusement Machine Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| v. Kendrick held that people are unlikely to become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| independent-minded adults and responsible citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| if they are raised in an intellectual bubble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| Having access to a variety of books will enhance a student's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| critical thinking skills and foster informed citizenship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| Furthermore, book bans actively hinder authors' abilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| to express themselves and disseminate knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| Banning a contentious book reveals narrow-mindedness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| and shows a blatant disregard for inclusivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| In the 1982 Supreme Court case Board of Education v. PICO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| the court held that the school board may not remove books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| from school libraries simply because they dislike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| the ideas in those books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| Even the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| the moral compass of modern nations, recognizes the necessity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| of multiple ideas circulation through books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| The 2013 Constitution states that everyone has the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| to freedom of opinion and expression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| This right includes the freedom to hold opinions without interference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| Book removal infringes upon this notion and underscores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| the inherent value of allowing diverse voices to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| Moreover, books targeted by bans sometimes grapple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| with controversial subjects such as racial equality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| and sexual identity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| The Human Rights Watch posits that how any society tolerates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| those with minority views will often speak to its performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| on human rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| So, what does banning books that deal with minority groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| say about the United States?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| With these court rulings and the Declaration of Human Rights in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| it is necessary for us to consider the consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| of silencing voices we disagree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| After all, our country cannot be the land of the free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| if people aren't allowed to express themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| We must do our utmost to create a society in which sharing ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| is celebrated, not censored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| Jonathan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2958)|

| 0:49:27| Hello, my name is Jonathan Knight and I'm a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| I'm also a library ambassador at West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| I work closely with the library and its books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| and I'm familiar with its systems as well as how they are managed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2976)|
| 0:49:46| I work closely with the library and its books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| and I'm familiar with its systems as well as how they are managed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| That being said, I'm here today to discuss the options we can take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| instead of banning library books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| I can confidently say that book banning is not the only option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| for protecting the decisions of parents to select what education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| their children have access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| And, in fact, banning books is absolutely the most harmful option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| that we could take here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| To discuss some other options, I want to start with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| Some schools have the ability for parents to opt out of their students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| checking out certain books or certain genres of books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| or books that contain certain themes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| That is a type of bill that needs to be passed, if anything at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| Not a bill banning or removing these books entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| This type of system is already implemented at West High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| through our cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| Recently, parents have been able to view everything that their student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| purchases so they can better monitor and implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| their own parental decisions from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| This gives parents freedom to decide what is best for their individual child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| or children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| This is not a hard system to implement or enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| That being said, book banning is a direct infringement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| of the rights of parents who actually disagree with these bans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| Parents who either want or don't mind their students reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| or having access to this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| It isn't fair to simply bar students from information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| to the students themselves or the parents in question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| especially when better options are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| I can assure the Board that libraries will work with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| to ensure that students aren't reading things that don't comply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| with their parents' desires, but they cannot work with book bans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| It is necessary to consider the ramifications of banning these books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| What's going to happen next? What's the big plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| How many more books will be banned from our school libraries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| To what extent will these bans be allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| Eventually, will there even be a library for students to find solace in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| Book banning destroys libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| no matter how small the ban may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| Please keep this in mind, and students, when you vote on this bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3109)|
| 0:51:56| Matt Blackman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| Matt, if you'll state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| You'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| Good evening. I'm Matt Blackman from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| Chair Henderson, thank you for moving us earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| Because after this meeting, I will leave you to your hours of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| thanklessly largely, because my family tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| will head to a dreaded university down south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| I won't say which one, but it's not Orange, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| Where we will attend an invited honors celebration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| where my daughter, who graduated at the top of her class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| at Bearden High School a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| having made one of the rare perfect ACT scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| is on a full academic scholarship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| I have no clue what she'll be tapped in tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| I suspect I'll cry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| Why? Because that's what I do when you have these emotional moments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| I'm proud of Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| Are you perfect? I hope not, because then I wouldn't belong here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| I'm proud of the work that you guys do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| as public servants, which is largely thankless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| in a very polarized environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| These kinds of conversations are not new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| They're just so much louder these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| And they get magnified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| Hundreds and thousands of years ago, there were debates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| about schools, perhaps not in Knox County libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| but in access to materials and access to other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| It's not a new story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| It's a loud story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| It's a story characterized by anger and fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| and threats and aggravation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| That's not how people dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| That's not how people learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| Oh, it gets headlines, it gets clicks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| and oh my goodness, does it get attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| But that's not education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| Only a few weeks ago, I spent over 120 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| with a large collection of Knox County high school students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| Why would I do that? Community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| I was convicted, but I was innocent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| No, that's a joke. It's okay to laugh. That's a joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| It's not a good joke, but hey, I'm a dad, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| I was on a chaperone field trip when Bearden High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| went to the St. Patrick's Day parade, and oh my goodness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| did they represent you well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| But after 120 hours, coming back on a bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| they smelled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| I'd like to say they smelled good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| They didn't. It's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| But you know what I did here? I heard all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| None of it bad, but it's the kinds of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| teenagers talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| It's not just passing pages out of library books so they can have fear and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| It's real life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| These teenagers deal with stuff that you and I never faced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| Why? I don't know. It's just how it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| We help them by educating them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| by giving them access to resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| by trusting our highly educated professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| to guide us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| Don't ban books. Let's encourage teachers. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| Susan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| I'm sorry, Susan. I have trouble reading the last name. I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| State your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| It's Susan Granke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| Good evening, esteemed board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| My name is Dr. Susan Granke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| I reside in Sevier County, but work in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| Over the past 20 years as Director of English Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| at the University of Tennessee, I've trained over 200| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| English teachers, many of whom have gone on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| to hold leadership positions in the district and the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| Another hat that I wear at the university is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| Director of the Center for Children's and Young Adult Literature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| so I read a lot of children's books and young adult novels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| that are published every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| One of the things I'm paid to do at the university is stay abreast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| of current research in adolescent development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| and adolescent motivation to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| As a teacher, I have a lot of expertise in these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| It's frustrating to hear again and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| the false narratives about adolescent readers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| and quote-unquote sensitive titles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| that would-be book banners keep exhorting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| Book banners cries that books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| that are being called sensitive titles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| are dangerous or damaging or inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| for teen readers fly in the face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| of what rigorous empirical research actually says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| about these books and what they do for teen readers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| Research published just this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| research based in real classrooms with real teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| with real students and their parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3403)|

| 0:58:12| and I would just suggest to maybe add teen voices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| to the school library councils and I would love to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| a parent-teacher-teen book club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3498)|

| 1:02:02| Hello, my name is Sherry Garrett and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| I grew up with a mother who loved reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| and instilled that in me as a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| We used to take trips to the library together and check out books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| From third grade until now, I was and am now an avid reader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| As a child, I would soar on the magic carpet with Aladdin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| solve mysteries with Nancy Drew and Trixie Belden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| I traveled to faraway places and had adventures in faraway countries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| I've read biographies on famous women such as Harriet Beecher Stowe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| Clara Barton, and Florence Nightingale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| As a child, I would take whatever book I was reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| I would go down the hill to my grandmother's house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| so I could get away from my brothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| In high school, I no longer climbed trees, but had a spot in the woods where I would read Shakespeare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| Little Women, The Secret Garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| Even now, I read daily, reading suspense novels from Lee Childs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| Patricia Cornwall, Janet Devonovich, as well as other genres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| Even right out of high school, I got a job at the Los Amiguis Library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| and I was there until I married.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| Reading expands the mind and the imagination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| It can take you far away and bring you close to home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| It can challenge your knowledge and make you want to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| But sadly, today's school libraries are now filling up with books that do not challenge your knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| but instead cause harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| Sexually explicit books with graphic text and details are being provided to children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| Books such as Gender Queer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| Trans+, which has QR codes taking children to descriptive websites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| with graphic imagery and video, and many others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| Trans+, so far, has been found at Austin East and Halls High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| where it is currently now checked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| As Madam Chairwoman stated last month, these are not challenging texts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| This is inappropriate content for minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| Just as our public schools cannot show elementary anything above a G rating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| PG or 13 for middle and high schoolers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| These books should not be in our school libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| They are available for purchase online, so we're not asking for banning books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| That is a falsehood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| They are available in bookstores and some are available at our public libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| where I've checked this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| We are not asking that books be banned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| simply that they be removed from access as they are inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| We send our children and grandchildren to public school for an education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| so that they can be functioning members of society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3850)|

| 1:04:16| Sadly, that's not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| Currently, policy I-241-2A states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| that a procedure for the development of a library collection at each school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| that is appropriate for the age and maturity levels of the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| that may access some materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| and that is suitable for and consistent with the educational mission of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| I do not see how sexually explicit pornographic materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| are a mission of the educational mission of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3877)|
| 1:04:43| It seems that when I hear from teachers and parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| that many KCS policies, such as the cell phone policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| and bullying harassment policy, are not being followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| it kind of seems to par for the course that this policy is also being ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| It would seem prudent that that no longer be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| I ask you to please remove sexually explicit pornographic content from our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| Laurieann?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| Laurieann, if you'll state your name and county of residence, you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3909)|
| 1:05:18| Hi, I'm Laurie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| I'm in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| First, I'd like to commend certain board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| for their candid, open speaking at the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| Ms. Henderson mentioned her belief in academic freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| and text that challenges, and went on to admit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| that the books brought to the board's attention were not challenging text| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| and admitted that they did contain sexually explicit imagery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| that is inappropriate content for minors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| For anyone in the audience or watching that is not aware of the books in question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3949)|
| 1:05:52| the images in the books are cartoon pornography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| with very descriptive words included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| The text and addition of the pictures and the totality of both together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| is completely unnecessary for use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| These books show cartoons in the act of undressing each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| cartoons masturbating, cartoons giving oral sex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| cartoons having sex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| The topics in these books include topics of rape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| group rape, group sex, adult and minor sex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| sex with same genders, sex with opposite genders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| just everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| It's a very expansive new genre of sexual literatures for minors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| and the minors part is what my concern is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| You went on to say some of the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| stating exposure to diverse ideas and viewpoints as being part of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| You praised the leadership in the libraries for choosing books of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| that build a love of reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| but mentioned that you may need to be tighter on the selection process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| and it seemed like you were questioning how you were able to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| and how these books might have got by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| That surprised me because me, I'm not an activist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| I'm just a mom and someone who kind of wishes that they didn't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| some of these books, that way I didn't have to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| I was just able to go online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| a quick online search and saw your guys' policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| so it seemed kind of easy to me, just follow your own policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| like the ones that were shown before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| the I-241, I-211, I-212.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| And I'm not bringing anything personal up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| that you didn't bring up yourself at the last board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| You had mentioned that you're a father| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| and that you didn't want your daughter having access to certain things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| so my question is, what about my daughter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| What about all the daughters at the middle schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| even Austin East, L&N, Central, Gibbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| because that's where most of the egregious books are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| And after looking into where they were found, I saw a trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| The statistically lower income schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| the less two-parent in the household schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| the lower socioeconomic schools, less PTA involvement schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| less money flowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| Essentially in schools where the students are considered more vulnerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| This leads me to believe one of two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| The middle school students are specifically being targeted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| or the sweet children in Farragut might not be getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| the same stellar challenging education, as you called it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| as Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| So I humbly ask that the board, when you guys consider the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| or the library, whoever makes the decisions next time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| that you go through your vetting and reveal process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| whatever isn't appropriate at your Farragut schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| might not be appropriate for any East Knox school either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| Sherry Super.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| Sherry, if you'll state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4124)|

| 1:08:59| wait, I'm sorry, the American Association of School Libraries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| falls under the umbrella of the American Library Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| In 2022, a tweet made by Emily Drabinsky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| the American Library Association president,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| mentioned that she was a lesbian Marxist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| who wants to queer the catalog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| In her 2013 paper titled Queering the Catalog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| she stated that engaging queer theory and cataloging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| requires new ways of thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| What is queer theory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| It has nothing to do with sex, gender, or sexuality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| World-renowned queer theorist David Halperin says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| unlike gay identity rooted in the positive fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| of homosexual object choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| queer identity need not be grounded in any positive truth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| or stable reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| Queer acquires its meaning from the oppositional relation to the norm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| Queer is by definition whatever is at odds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| with the normal, the legitimate, the dominant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| Gender identity without an essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| Queer is a political stance against normalcy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| and has little to do with sexual preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| Any mention of terms like gender identity, cisgender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| gender expression, transgender, safe or inclusive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4209)|

| 1:10:15| In reality, you are assisting in creating future activists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| in the queer theory army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4218)|

| 1:10:24| Queer theorists don't recognize boundaries between children and adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| and when activists reduce children to an empty category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| society can no longer say, we must protect children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| Queer theory wants to collapse boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| between children and adults by sexualizing children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| with books like Gender Queer and Fun Home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| which takes us to a nasty corner of queer theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4242)|

| 1:10:48| theorist Gail Rubin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| says, listen to this folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| boy lovers are so stigmatized it is difficult to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| defenders of their civil liberties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| let alone their erotic orientation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| Consequently, police aim to wipe out the community of men| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| who love underage youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| Shocking, but many queer theorists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| support pedophilia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| These books intentionally sexualize and destabilize children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4275)|

| 1:11:21| It endangers children and it is not by accident, it is by design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| Don't allow activist demands to cloud your judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| Queer theory started in universities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| and has infiltrated K-12 education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| It must be rooted out of the curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| classrooms, policies, and school libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4296)|

| 1:11:52| Okay, board members, we will continue on with our discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| on this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| I know, Sarah, what's up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| Sarah, if you want to come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| Thanks for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| I know, Ms. Spike, you had...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| I'm curious if you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| tell me about our librarians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| and what it takes to qualify to apply for a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| as a librarian at Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| My apologies for the cough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| I have two children of daycare age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| and germs are the one thing I share really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| In Tennessee, and it's regulated by the state like other teacher licenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| there are three things that are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| The library media endorsement as an add-on to that license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| and a master's degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| There are different ways of arriving at those three things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| in different university programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| You can do them all at once as kind of a bundle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| If teachers take a different route to come with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| then they can get them piecemeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| but those are the three qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| When they have the master's degree or these other qualifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| they are accredited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| Is that checked that they're in some way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| There are a couple of different accrediting agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| and those mirror the accreditation process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| for any other kind of teacher education program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| but there's background behind that and the universities regulate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| What type of master's degree would they have to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| Would it be any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| You can go through it by any route in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| as long as you have the content area endorsement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| The usual, what we call library school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| because it makes us feel like med school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| that degree would probably be either a master's degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| in library science, in library and information science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| or just information science minus the latter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| It will be some combination of LIS in that case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| but it's not uncommon for teachers to have a master's in reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| or a master's degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| I had a co-librarian early in my career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| whose master's was in deaf education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| Anyone with a master's in another field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| if they want to come into librarianship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| they can do, instead of doing another full master's degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| in library science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| they can do an endorsement only program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| which would be about the same length usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| as if you did a full master's degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| It would be about the same length usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| as if you did an endorsement program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| for an administrator's certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| It's about the same number of credit hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| If you did one of those, it would be coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| one of these master's programs, graduate schools most likely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| just not the full master's degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| You talked about in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| and some of the new things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| how are those librarians chosen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| What we hope for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| and this has not been fully written out yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| but what we hope for and what we've talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| with some people in focus groups as we've started to draft these ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| is to the best of our ability to look at a rotation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| so that everybody has a chance to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| There are slightly over 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| middle schools and high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| so if we had five members on each of those committees at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| so if we had five members on each of those committees at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| then in a three-year cycle we could get through most of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| We hope that that would be a good learning experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| for each of them to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| That's all of my questions. I do have some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| Do we want to do questions first or do we want to go into comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| I'm a mother of two children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| and my kids went to Sequoia Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| One is still at Sequoia Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| I've had the privilege to spend some time in that library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| a handful of mornings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| re-stacking books for Ms. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| I think it's five or six years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| I've always appreciated the collection that she's kept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| and on days that she's been absent when I've volunteered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| she's left little notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| During holiday times she always pulls out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| specific holiday books and they really seem to reflect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| what the kids want to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| and really getting them involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| I feel so good as a parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| that I am welcomed into the library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4596)|
| 1:16:39| and that I can be a part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| because I'm not going to claim to be a professional in reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| or books or anything like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| and I like to see what the kids are reading these days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| and what my kids are interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| because also my daughter had some reading issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| she's now in middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4617)|
| 1:17:00| and I would often ask the librarian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| she's interested in this stuff but she's really struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| so it needs to be a lower level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| can you give me recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| I've really always appreciated that I had that openness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| and I hope that all parents really feel welcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| to be a part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| I really like that we're bringing some parents in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| to be a part of some of these groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| and I think that's really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| and I think we're making some good progress in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| My last comment is going back to talking about books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| of different demographics that happen to be at other schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| versus other schools and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| I come from a very poor rural farming family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| and I was the only of her family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| and the first of her family to even graduate high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| the abuse that happened in my mom's family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| I don't want to speak about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| but it was not pleasant that my mom experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| and her siblings and my cousins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| and the fact that they didn't have books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| and that many of them tried to take their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| I wonder if they had books that helped explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| some of what they were going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| would have helped them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| and I welcome that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| I'm very privileged to be a part of my kids life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| and have those conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| but for kids that don't have anyone to explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| what might be happening to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| I think that's really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| so I'm really glad we're making this process better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| I do appreciate the work of our librarians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| I know they work hard and sometimes thankless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| and I appreciate your work in putting this together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| and figuring all this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| I know that's a little bit challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| and I understand some of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| I do have a couple of questions on these sensitive titles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| so we've got people reviewing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| these are going to be reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| we have a policy that talks about some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| about how things are picked for our libraries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| and instructional materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| what standard will they be reviewed against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| It is difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| in librarianship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| to define that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| because what you've done when you've published a book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| is you've taken a slice of reality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4770)|
| 1:19:34| and in trying to define a standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| you have to predict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| what might be all those realities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| that we would ever be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| what we find typically in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| is that the best thing we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| is drive it back to multiple criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| if there's anyone who's ever found a single standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| by which things can be judged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| I don't know them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| I'm sure they would make a lot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| but what the typical approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| and what the approach in our policy is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| is to drive it back to quite a few different criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| and to try to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| the preponderance of evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| and just make the best decision possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| you end up with a lot of different data points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| and one thing that I think was really helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| from Ms. Lautner's presentation last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| was really looking at how you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| each data point in isolation really doesn't tell a story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| it's knitting them together where you start to get a good understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| and I think there's a really good parallel there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| with how those decisions end up getting made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| so the criteria that are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| in our policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| I think it's helpful just to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| it's the same criteria in our selection policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| as in our reconsideration policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| so literally what we do in reconsideration is we reconsider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| was this a good decision and is it still a good decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| trying to go back to that original decision point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| on those criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| and give it a fresh look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| Will there be an administrative procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| that comes out of that that sort of lays out that criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| for folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| I would say again I think that the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| coming back to the policy exists already just in terms of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| is looked at in terms of those materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| I think adjustments to the administrative procedure would be more around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| the addition of these new steps that we've talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| and being part of how we go about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| both managing and constantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| reviewing our titles and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| I guess my challenge is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| part of the catalyst for this was some books that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| I feel are inappropriate for the age group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| I don't think belong in a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| I'm not interested in banning all the books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| I appreciate the review process I think that makes some sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| but if we're just going to review them by the same standards we always have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| I guess the question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| why go through the process of reviewing if they're already there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| they've been in theory held up to this standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| so I guess what's different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| I appreciate the review and I appreciate the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| and I think that a review process is good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| I think reviewing some of these sensitive titles is good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| but if they've already passed the standard what's going to be different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| the next time we review it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| I hope what's fresh in this approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| is just having a lot more voices involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| the traditional approach has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| because we honor and value that expertise of the librarian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| in each building and that detailed training that they've gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| they have been positioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| sort of as the sole deciders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| what we really hope by the addition of these two layers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| is that A on the sensitive title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| review committee we'd have multiple librarians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| because they're going to look at each of those criteria differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| there will be some subjective nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| any time you line the content of a book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| against this list of criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| it's not going to be clear how they necessarily align| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| and there will be a point at which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| each person makes a call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| so I think when you get more people at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| you get a much better view of how that call is going to come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| librarians value that too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| when we've had focus groups telling them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| just getting some feedback about this idea in development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| they've said oh yes I would love to have that opportunity to talk to my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| because many of them disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| and that's why we see different collections in different schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| in addition to trying to customize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| based on the feedback available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| we also see different decision making among our librarians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| and I think we would see that come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| as a new layer within that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| and then I think especially the new layer would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| coming back to these building level committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| because then it's not just librarians in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| so we hope that all of those perspectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| given the inevitable subjective nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| of some of these decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| we hope that having all of those perspectives at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| gives more richness to that decision making process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| I appreciate that and I appreciate you explaining all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| and I know all of this wasn't created in a vacuum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| I know you had help and folks that worked with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| and I guess I would just give a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| I believe what we need is at least a base standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| I think we would clearly state that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| we wouldn't want pornography in the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| but if it's just up to a few votes that could get in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| so I would think that from a central office level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| I know that we have differing viewpoints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| and I wouldn't want everything I disagree with removed from the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| I wouldn't want that at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| but at the same time I would think we would need a base standard somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| to say this is the base standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| that we're going to start from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| and then we're going to review some sensitive titles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| and we're going to look at some other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| I think it's important to have a base level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| that parents know that this kind of content is not available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| and it's not every time you find the word sex in a book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| we're not saying get rid of that book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| I understand that but at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| there should be a base standard that folks can trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| Knox County Schools won't have these in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| one more question then I'll leave it up and let somebody else talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| the state has a law related to obscene materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| Mr. Duper is not here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| so Mr. Sanders did not feel prepared to answer those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| and that's okay I understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| is that something that our current protocol says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| it's got to be a parent from a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| of a child in that school that questions a book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| and that's how it gets reviewed initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| I know you're going to review sensitive titles since you find other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| the state law, if I felt like something was obscene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| and I don't have a child in Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| can I appeal that decision without going directly through the normal process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| for the state review process specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| does it have to follow the process in Knox County and then go to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| it stipulates that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| that process is designed to appeal district level decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| so the expectation is that if it goes to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| it's gone through the first steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| gotcha| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5206)|
| 1:26:52| Mrs. Horton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| thank you Madam Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| thank you Sarah for this presentation, this is helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| I think that obviously this is a complex issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| we've had conversations about it and it's very nuanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| and it can be complex based on various opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| and I think that our reconsideration policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| is important because opinions do vary widely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| and I think also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| the good thing about having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| five to seven people on a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5242)|
| 1:27:25| is that the trained professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| may not represent the viewpoint of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| and so I really like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| we have various people represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| in that group, I think that's very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| and I think two concerns that I had made note of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| and then I heard from a couple of speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| that I would hope we would pay particular attention to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| and Mr. Triplett touched on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| one of those regarding sexually explicit materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| and how books are chosen and that kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| I think in our policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| and just based on what we're expected to do by the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| regarding Tennessee state standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| our policy says that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| books should be chosen that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| satisfy a need for educational purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| so I would hope that as we're reviewing books that that is particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| noted and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| I think that it's difficult to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| blanket statements but I think when we think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| specifically visual images| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| that we need to be very cautious on what is included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5312)|
| 1:28:36| and offered in books because there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| a lot of examples that I don't think would add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| value to students or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| would be supported by our Tennessee state standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| because those standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| certainly don't include a lot of those explicit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| images so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| based on those standards, based on our policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| I think we have some books in our schools that should not be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| so I would hope that we would take care of that sooner rather than later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| and then the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| let's see, I think, or maybe that did touch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| on both of them, I think it actually did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| that's kind of the big thing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| I understand that as Mr. Triplett also said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| I may not like every book that's in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| I'm not saying we should look at these things with a broad brush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| but I do think that we need to be extremely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| sensitive to the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| we're spending taxpayer dollars on these books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| and they should be books that are age appropriate for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| and that we should not be, I understand teenagers may be having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| sex, we shouldn't be promoting that they do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| and we should not be spending money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| the taxpayers money in such books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| and I think we need to keep that at a very high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| priority in our minds. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| Thank you Ms. Horan. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| Thank you Madam Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| thank you Sarah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| I also want to thank the community for coming out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| there's many, many opinions that have been shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| and it's obviously a topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| that hits home because it's based on values, it's based on viewpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| and I would expect everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| in this room feels something about this topic, I would guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| and I appreciate the differing of opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| I do want to give a little shout out to West High though because that's where my daughter goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| I didn't know that West High had a library association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| with student representatives which I think is fantastic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| I would have never even thought to join that when I was in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| so the fact that there are students who care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| and are that passionate about what's happening in our libraries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| I think is important and I think it's great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| always when we have student reps, no matter what their viewpoints are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| they're coming and sharing with us because we need to hear more and more from our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| Sarah with that, I do have one question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| that I know you addressed a lot in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| our collections at the beginning and how that works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| and what a librarian does to help make that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| the thing I didn't really hear and I just wasn't clear about is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| when we use the word collection and we think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| building it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| I know that individual collections live in individual school libraries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| but are we thinking about the collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| by school, by grade band, by district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| define the collection I guess is what I'm asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5486)|
| 1:31:32| in terms of the process that you laid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| when you say collection, at what level are you talking about a collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| thank you for that last clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| so in that case we'd be looking at the building level collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| because that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| primary set of materials that would be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| to any given child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| so easiest way to think of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| if you walk into West High School's library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| what do you see on your shelves? That's the collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| we would also consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| digital materials a part of that collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| and occasionally you get something fun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| in a different format but that would be the main thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| is looking within a building and what is primarily available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| inside that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| my assumption is that's probably a pretty intentional decision in practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| why do it at that level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| it's intentional, it's also historical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| I think the historical reason would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| before we had the internet that's all we could control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| was what's literally in your building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| we do it that way now because that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| the preponderance of feedback is going to come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| to inform that needs assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| and a lot of that is to Ms. Horn's point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| coming from those educational purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| because we have state standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| that theoretically define a consistent experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| for all of our students at a given grade level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| but we know because we've met schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| that we end up with tremendous variations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| and those variations are often at the building level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| I too have a soft spot in my heart for West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| because that's where I was a building level librarian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| one of the biggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| examples from my own experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| where you might see big variations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| in the educational programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| I was there when the IB program was first implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| and I assisted with the extended essay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| that those students write as part of their diploma program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| and what we realized as we started to teach students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| to write this extended essay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| which was a very different assignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| than anything they would get in their standard level curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| that we needed to give some different instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| on topic selection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| so we changed up our topic selection instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| and what we instantly found was that students were interested in subjects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| that were not being taught in their standard curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| they were interested in psychology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| and how you interpret dreams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| and the criminal justice system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| so that really told us we have to invest some funds here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| and that was a budget strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| that other schools would not use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| because they would not have that driver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| in their instructional programming coming from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| with modern technology we do have some options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| to think about expanding our collections outside the four walls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| our librarians keep up a hefty traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| on our email listserv| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| borrowing items from each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| but we also have formal lending relationships with Knox County Public Library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| which we use occasionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| what we more often use is a lending arrangement with UT's library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| primarily at the high school level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| we use that to access things that aren't in our collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| and that helps us be thoughtful too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| with our use of funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| because by extending outside our four walls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| we can use our funds primarily on the things we know are big drivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5710)|
| 1:35:13| within our building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| but we can think about how to be really efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| with gaining additional resources from the outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| so that gives us a way to expand those resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| but again based on case by case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| so is it fair to say then that across all of our collections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| within a particular grade band| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| like high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| that there would probably be quite a bit of variety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| and that's intentional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| is it also fair to say then that that variety has probably evolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| and changed quite a bit as culture changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| as the culture shifts our collections will likely shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| and there's probably books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| that are no longer in our libraries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| that people would have deemed pretty appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| probably 40, 50, 60 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| that we as a society would no longer deem appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| so I think one of the things that I'm hearing in this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| I'm hearing two things in the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| one is what process does Knox County Schools use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| what's the right process to try to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| at a healthy collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| that honors the variety of viewpoints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| and the educational purposes that our students have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| I'm also hearing another conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| and that conversation is what is the baseline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| in terms of appropriateness for a given society at a given time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| and that changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| and I certainly don't want to be the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| who gets to make that ultimate decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| for any one group of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| and I don't think as a board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| that's really my role or our role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| is to claim at this one point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| that this is the baseline of what we consider healthy or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| as a society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| and in that I can also say that I have a set of values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| that I stick to and that I expect my family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| to not stick to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| they're all human too and they get to make their choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| but that I want to inform them and help them understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| and so to me in a pluralistic society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| the only way you get at what is that standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| at any one moment, because I think it shifts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| I think it absolutely shifts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| and maybe the word is better guideline than a standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| state standards to me are different than what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| I would think that's the minimum expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5857)|
| 1:37:41| I think the way you have to do that as a pluralistic society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| is you have to gather enough of that society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| those stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| to have good, hard conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| that also allow for people to bring in their bias| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| because it's really hard to completely divorce yourself from it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| but also to bring in good research and training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| and how do we do this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| I don't just bring my bias to the table, I've got to bring some other things to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| I've got to have other tools in the toolbox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| and so to me what I appreciate about this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| you all, before you even came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| did some work to get ahead of it and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| hey, how do we need to modify and shift and adapt our process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| I don't know that I'm the expert in the room to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5903)|
| 1:38:26| man, you nailed it, or here's some other things that I might shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5906)|
| 1:38:29| I think the idea that I did here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| that I actually liked was having some student representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| on the school library councils, I think that could be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| I know some folks at West High would jump up on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| and there's probably others too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| but to me that's the best we can hope for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| and again, my comments are not saying that there's no baseline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| but you get to that through wrestling it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| and I don't think any one group gets to own that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| and claim that for anybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| and I mean that, I mean any group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| I don't think any group should get to decide that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| and so again, I appreciate the work on the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| this is not the first time that you've been before the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5951)|
| 1:39:14| and I've learned more about librarians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| and the work that they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| as somebody who's never met one in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5960)|
| 1:39:23| and had a long conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| I've got my images of what librarians are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| and I'm sure we all do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| but the reality is I think you all play a pivotal role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| in our society because again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| as culture changes, what we access changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| or what we want to access and what we collect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| and what we curate changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| the last comment I'll make is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| I can honestly say as a parent of three kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5990)|
| 1:39:53| now 19, 18 and 14| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| I can't tell them about what they accessed in the library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| I don't say that to minimize people who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| that's not why I say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6002)|
| 1:40:05| but I think we have a lot of other challenges out there that we have to face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6005)|
| 1:40:08| and I've also learned as a parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| that I cannot completely shelter and monitor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| my kids and what they're doing, not in today's world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| I just can't, I tried to fight that battle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| for a little bit, I lost really bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| and to me as a parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| I think the thing that I want to shift into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| and how I want to be better as a parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| is I want to be prepared to have really good conversations with my kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| and help them be good thinkers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| and how to wrestle with the content that they are going to be exposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| that they are going to face, whether or not I like it or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| I mean they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| and to me that's how I want to posture myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| and if I have the opportunity, we can do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| because what our kids need to feel from us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| is not alienation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| but hey, you're willing to be in the mess with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| and you're willing to help me make decisions and figure some things out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| so, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| Thank you, Ms. Christie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| and thank you Sarah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| I appreciate this and the work you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| I can't imagine being a librarian right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| in the current climate nationwide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| and just one question, do we have any systems in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| where parents can opt their students out of materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| or is that something we could look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| if we do not already have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| It's not systematized, it's an individual basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| but I would strongly encourage any parent who's got a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| to make contact with their librarian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| and they want to take care of their kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| librarians want the same thing as parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| and every school library has a public-facing website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| they can find it as a branch off from their school website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| and if they have any trouble, they can let my staff know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| and we'll be happy to help them get in contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| So that is something parents could use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| as an avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| I would just need to reach out to the school library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| Just a couple of other notes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| I think we can all agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| we do not want pornography in our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| When we talk about baselines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| I do worry that maybe it will catch some of those books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| that we do want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| but it's not going to be enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| I do think we need to be careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| about having very rigid baselines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| because a lot of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| different people have different opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| so I would be just cautioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| that there might be unintended consequences there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| and I do think we need to be mindful of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| I do like having more eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| and less eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| I love the idea of having a parent on it as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| and I do appreciate the work you put into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| I know you all get tired of hearing me say this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| but I'm going to say it again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| Since we are talking about children being exposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| to explicit material or predators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| I would also caution parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| that they need to be mindful about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6206)|
| 1:43:29| what their kids are accessing on their devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| We talk about social media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6212)|
| 1:43:35| YouTube, streaming services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6215)|
| 1:43:38| online gaming platforms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| and there are people out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| that want to target your children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| and can send them private messages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| and they have it right there on their phones all day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| I know that's kind of off topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| but it does go along with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| some of what parents are worried about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| in this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6243)|
| 1:44:11| Thank you Madam Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6251)|
| 1:44:14| Mr. Triplett may have already answered my question for Mr. Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| Are you able to talk about the Miller test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| or is that best saved for another time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| That is best saved for another time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| These issues are very complex from a legal perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| and Gary has done a lot of good work with the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| helping you draft policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| helping you draft procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| I'm not going to try to step into it at a moment's notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| so I'm going to leave that to Mr. Dupler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| Thank you, I appreciate that answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| Holding that over for another time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| the thing that I would like to most point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| is that parents have a responsibility to look at the work as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| and that's important too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| considering all of those pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| considering its value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| or its lack of value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| and so if we are taking a look at a teeny piece of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| or even selections from it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| or photos from it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| then when we're looking at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| it might very easily be considered to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| inappropriate or obscene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| but those pieces have to be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| as part of the whole when we're looking at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| so I would encourage board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| when you're looking at those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| to be sure that you have read the work in its entirety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| to make those decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6343)|
| 1:45:46| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6346)|
| 1:45:49| I just want to make one more comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| I've heard several times from several different people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| that I know culture shifts, people change, opinions change, feelings change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| communities are different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| and I'm well aware of that and I understand that there are differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| and I do understand that culture does change over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| but I just simply want to say that absolute truth is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6367)|
| 1:46:10| and there is absolute truth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| and if we will live by that we are far better off for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| Thank you Mr. Triplett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| I agree. Reverend Butler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6382)|
| 1:46:25| we have a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6385)|
| 1:46:28| so let's follow the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| if at one level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| it's not resolved you go to the next level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| if it's not resolved there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| you go to the next level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| and then if it's not resolved they come to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| if it's not resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| it goes to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| we have a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| we've talked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| and we end up in the same place every time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| so let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| work the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| and if the policy doesn't work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| then we would have to change it but we haven't worked the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6436)|
| 1:47:19| I haven't been on the board long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| I keep on saying I'm new I was told I can't say I'm new anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| none have come to the board yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| I'm not sure how many have gone to the central office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| I'm not sure how many have gone past a certain point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| I do know there are three books you're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| they were reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| so is that the reason why you're looking at them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| Those are books that we're just aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| that on a broad scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| are widely considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| to have some sensitive value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| one of those has had some attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| locally I think there's plenty of room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| when we think about the huge perspectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| including what we've seen in this room tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| that there's certainly room for questions on the other two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| and that's where we want to think about that proactive approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| the main reason we picked those three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| was thinking about the wide sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6499)|
| 1:48:22| about what's considered sensitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| we really wanted to make sure we were testing different types of books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| is primarily what you're seeing on that list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| so it was important to us to thoroughly test the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| by seeing how it comes out with more than one type of text| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| so that's a lot of what you're seeing there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| so then if they were reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6520)|
| 1:48:43| if it's not resolved to that level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6523)|
| 1:48:46| it goes to another level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| the other thing I'd say is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| I agree that there is truth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| but one of the things I found out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| I'm a pastor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| African Methodist Episcopal Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6541)|
| 1:49:04| and we have our name Zion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| we call ourselves Zion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| and one of the things I found out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6550)|
| 1:49:13| just from the study of ministry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| I have a doctorate in ministry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6556)|
| 1:49:19| is that even among church folk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6559)|
| 1:49:22| there's not necessarily absolute truth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| tonight I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| some very eloquent young people speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| and I've heard some other folk who spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| and I agree with what both of you all have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| I sit at a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| where I don't want any of our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| no matter what school they go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6583)|
| 1:49:46| to be subject to information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6586)|
| 1:49:49| that's going to harm them in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6589)|
| 1:49:53| but also I don't want to have anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| to have information held from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| that can help them in some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| so I think that we have a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| that helps us with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| there are going to be some folk who have been trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| to do that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6611)|
| 1:50:14| and that they have to go through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| and I don't think it's going to be a baseline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| and say is this book a book we should have in our school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| and if the answer is no and you take it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| it can be gotten somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| if you say yes and it's not agreed upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6630)|
| 1:50:33| you go to the next level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6633)|
| 1:50:36| the last thing I will say is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| and I say this as graciously as I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| I think you speak for your school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6642)|
| 1:50:45| you speak for your community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| and I'll just be honest and say it straight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6652)|
| 1:50:55| when someone mentions Austin East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| and they're not from Austin East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6658)|
| 1:51:01| you can't say what Austin East thinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6661)|
| 1:51:04| you can't say what Austin East feels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6664)|
| 1:51:09| and I'm saying it as graciously as I can because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| my son is 2800| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| and so he graduated in 2012 out of Victoria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6676)|
| 1:51:19| went to Penn Wharton School of Business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| we're proud of all he's done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| he's working hard now for his church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| for his community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6688)|
| 1:51:31| and I could probably say every book he ever read I read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| and some of the books he read I'm like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6694)|
| 1:51:37| boy are you reading this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6697)|
| 1:51:40| and we talk about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6700)|
| 1:51:43| and some of the things I say no you can't have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| we're not reading that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6706)|
| 1:51:49| and so I'm saying this to say that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| this situation, this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6712)|
| 1:51:55| and we can talk about it every board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| and it's not going to resolve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6718)|
| 1:52:01| we have a process, we have a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| let's utilize it and as we utilize it let's get better at utilizing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| because I for one do not want to spend another hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| thank you Reverend Butler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| Sarah I just want to thank you for guiding us through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| and I really appreciate that these new steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| do involve more stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| as an added support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| I love that it is more proactive versus reactive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6748)|
| 1:52:31| and you also went through the current process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| which I think is important to highlight for parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| because a lot of times they don't know how to use that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| and so you even highlighting that I think is a benefit for parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6760)|
| 1:52:43| I was talking to somebody recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| from another state and we were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| book programs and she said to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6769)|
| 1:52:52| we don't even have libraries in a certain community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| and I assumed she meant public libraries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| she meant their schools don't have libraries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| because they're more rural and a poor school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| and that shocked me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| I think we take for granted that we are blessed that we have libraries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| and thank you for working with us on this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| like I said last meeting I do believe in academic freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| and exposure to diverse ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| but not sexually explicit imagery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| and I think that this process will help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6802)|
| 1:53:25| and I really appreciate all the work that you've put into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| Sarah did you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6808)|
| 1:53:31| Thank you all for the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6811)|
| 1:53:34| I think we should probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| take a break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| and then it will give some of our guests a chance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| stretch their legs or leave if they've spoken and are ready to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| so we'll come back in about 10 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6826)|
| 1:54:01| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240404?start=6841)|
