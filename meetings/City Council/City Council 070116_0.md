| 0:03:44| Mayor, don't we need to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=225)|

| 0:03:53| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| Doug, we need to make a motion to withdraw the items that are marked on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| That would be 12C, D, E, F, G. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=235)|

| 0:03:58| Excuse me for getting out of order, but you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| Those are all the items dealing with the South Waterfront, 12C through G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=239)|
| 0:04:14| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Any questions or comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=256)|

| 0:04:20| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| Mayor, 12L, and I don't know if the applicant's here or not, but it's an ordinance to close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=266)|
| 0:04:36| the old Topside Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| Sir, could you come up to the podium for a minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| I want to go ahead and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| We deal with this up front if we can, rather than making them sit here and wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| Sir, could you state your name, just for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| Sir, it's Dart Livingston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| And your address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| 208 Blue Sky Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| And you are the applicant for the closure of this old right-of-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| You probably are not aware of this, but the Tennessee, TDOT, Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| has plans to reconfigure that entire interchange, and it appears that they're going to need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=320)|
| 0:05:27| some or all of that right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| And it doesn't really make sense for us to close that yet until we clarify what their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=329)|
| 0:05:35| plans and needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| So I'm going to make a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| If you have any comments, you need to make them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| But that is the motion I'm going to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| How long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| Well, I've talked to them pretty intensely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| Their plans for the future up at Strawberry Plains in the headquarters, and they kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| of explained where their easements are going to go, and it doesn't really have anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| to do with the topside closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| Well, Mr. King may want to make a statement on that, but I think there's some question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=360)|
| 0:06:08| as to whether it does or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| I think that's correct, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| And maybe if the postponement is passed, it will give us an opportunity to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| with Mr. Livingston, and maybe we can go see TDOT together to understand the impact on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=379)|
| 0:06:26| this right-of-way with the Alcoa Highway Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| Mr. King, I'm thinking four weeks, because I'm not sure if you can really schedule all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| that in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| But do you think you can do it in four weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| Do you think you could do it in two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| We'll try to meet whatever schedule you suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| I'm not sure what his time frame is, but either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| Mr. Livingston, does postponing it for two weeks or four weeks materially affect you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| Either one is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| I'm going to make a motion to postpone it for four weeks, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| Quick point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| Mr. King said, I think that's right, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| I heard two statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| Which statement was right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| Well, I think Mr. Livingston stated that he had met with TDOT and he understood that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| unopened right-of-way would not be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| And I think the Councilman has stated that he thinks it may be affected and may be needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=434)|
| 0:07:21| for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| I was agreeing with Councilman Alcoa's statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| I just need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| There were two different statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| And, Mr. Livingston, I think from the city's point of view, we just want to make sure we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| straight with the state before we do something, have them come back and say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| why didn't you let us know about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| So it's not an ill intent toward your project as much as making sure we work hard to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| well with the state and we want to make sure we're on the same page with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| We're trying to avoid what we've seen happen in the past, which is the left-hand not knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| what the right-hand does and lots of money getting spent unnecessarily and that sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| So, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| Did we vote or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| We didn't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| And we will get back to you in four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| In the meantime, we'll touch base with TDOT and maybe you and Mr. King can go visit with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| Any other items dealing with the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| I know there's a lot to do, so I'll be real brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| Just one announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| I said some sad news, but some good news with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=498)|
| 0:08:34| Jill Van Beek, who's been our Deputy Director for Policy Development, basically focusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| on downtown, is going to be leaving us to go work in private business and we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| appreciate all that Jill has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| A lot of the progress we've made downtown in so many ways has Jill's fingerprints all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| We very much appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| The three plus years that she has spent with the city in dealing with so many problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| and issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| This will be her last week with the city, so Jill, thank you and we wish you well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| I have a feeling we'll be seeing a lot of you since hopefully you'll be staying around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| and contributing to our downtown in new and different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| The good news part of that is that the director of that department, Dr. Lyon, has worked very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| quickly to fill that role and sitting next to Jill is Madeline Weil, who is joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=555)|
| 0:09:22| She previously worked as an environmental planner with the city of New Haven, Connecticut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| where she coordinated the city's energy and air quality programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| As part of her duties here, she'll coordinate the downtown development activities and serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| as our city's point of contact for residents, business organizations, and government agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| She got her degree in American Studies from Carleton College in Minnesota and her master's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| from Yale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| She and her husband are proud new residents of Island Home Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| We're glad to have you at the city and glad to have you living in the city as well, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Councilman Horquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| Mayor, I just want to second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| She contacted me soon after they moved into Knoxville and she and I met and I was very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| very impressed with what I heard from her and her capabilities, so I think she'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| a real plus and an asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=611)|

| 0:14:28| Mr. Hondoulas, if you'd come forward to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=868)|
| 0:14:40| Mr. Hondoulas, if you'd give us your name and address, and I would remind you, you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| My name is Hondoulas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| I have two addresses, one in Gatlinburg, 1676 Maryville Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=886)|
| 0:14:54| As you all know, I've appeared before this august body, and I appreciate the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=894)|
| 0:15:00| to do so again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| I'm here, of course, in opposition to the so-called Vestal Redevelopment Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=901)|
| 0:15:08| It appears to be an agreement with the South Knoxville Waterfront Plan, which provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| certain conditions under which the city, KCDC, can operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| One of the conditions are that property can be taken for dilapidated but not for blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=918)|
| 0:15:24| That's the condition for the South Knoxville Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| The conditions for the Vestal Plan are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| They call for us, KCDC, to take our property if it's blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=930)|
| 0:15:38| We think those conditions should be similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| We shouldn't be under any more onerous circumstances in Vestal than we are for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=941)|
| 0:15:47| South Knoxville Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| If dilapidation is a test for the standards for that, it should be a test for us also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| On a more serious note, though, is the fact that our property is being taken under this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| development plan and put into a separation from all the other people in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=961)|
| 0:16:15| I guess I'm going to add a word for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| In effect, we've lost our property rights, significant portions of our property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| KCDC is now, in all effects, a trustee of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| Over the next 20 years, they can do pretty much whatever they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| They can call the shots and require conditions from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| They can put us on a time scale if we're working on rehabilitating or doing repair works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=994)|
| 0:16:41| They can do a lot of things they can't do outside that rehabilitation zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| It's a significant property right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| Property rights are one of the rights granted to us under the Bill of Rights along with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| the right to life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, the right to worship, the right of free press,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1013)|
| 0:17:00| the right of free speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| If you take one of those rights out, why not take the rest of them out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| If it's convenient, if it's profitable, if it creates jobs, if it does a number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| Let's just get rid of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| Now, what's wrong with a development plan such as outlined here by KCDC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| An example would be, I'll give you two examples here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| Show you how a development plan can be, can work against property owners and business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| owners in the South Knox Investor Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| Let's assume a business operator, older investor A, he's not in the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1053)|
| 0:17:41| The developer comes to him and says, your property is valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| I can make some money off of it and increase the tax revenue in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| Well, there's no agreement between the older and the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| So, the developer goes to KCDC and said, I think that property is blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| Why don't you try and take it and give it to me and I'll give you a lot more tax money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| I'll increase the tax burden, tax load to you by at least 10 percent, 10 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| Well, the property owner, KCDC, proceeds to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| The property owner will go into court and say, well, he approached me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| My property is not blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| That's one of his defenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| My property is not blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| Secondly, the test for blight is too vague, as we have noticed how vague it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| It can test by taking your property in all of South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| He can test that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| But he's got another test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| He can say, he can point to that law passed last July saying that property would not be taken from him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| given to a developer by government action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| And he said, he has a right to say, it's obvious here that what's, the KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1122)|
| 0:18:50| this is a ploy on the part of the developer and KCDC to take my property in defiance of that right given to me by statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| to protect myself from this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1136)|
| 0:19:03| So the court has an opportunity to test the equities existing between KCDC, the developer, and the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1143)|
| 0:19:12| But let's take another case where we have an existing development plan such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| KCDC can proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| The developer can go to KCDC or the mayor's office or some agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| 30 more seconds, Mr. Andules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| We have to give him three more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| Then you'll have three and a half more minutes from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| Once a plan is put into motion and established by council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| the developer can go to KCDC or anybody in government and suggest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| hey, that property owned by Mr. B out there in the Vestal Plan and within the Vestal areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| I think it's blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| If you'll just take some action, take it away from him, put it up for sale, I'll guarantee you I'll buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1190)|
| 0:19:57| And I'll give you a lot more money in taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| What's happened here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| That statute protecting a property owner last year creates a right on a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1203)|
| 0:20:13| And the developer, to get that property, has to go around that statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| He didn't have to do that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| Before that law was passed, it was okay for KCDC to take a property and give it to a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1219)|
| 0:20:26| with a blessing of the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| But now he can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| He's got to go around that statute somehow or other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| And the temptation to do this by a developer over the next 20 years will lead to serious problems for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1235)|
| 0:20:46| You've seen those problems of ethics across the state, across the counties, across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| And approving this will simply open up that same problem here within the bowels of city government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1252)|
| 0:21:00| How do we have a development that can be honest and above board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| First of all, allow required developer, before a development plan is brought into being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1264)|
| 0:21:13| require developer to come in and apply for development of a specific portion of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| You have a paper trail for the court and the property owner and everybody concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| to test whether or not that whole process is legitimate and honest or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1285)|
| 0:21:31| If you put a plan into action like this, you'll never get that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| Our property owner never knows what the motives of KCDC is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| or whether there's a developer hidden behind that screen of that plan area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1301)|
| 0:21:48| He never knows that there's anything behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| What you're risking here is honesty in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| So if you want an honest government, require that before a development plan is initiated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| developer or the property owner has to ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| Let them come in, file an application, and then let the KCDC proceed on that basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1324)|
| 0:22:12| Once that does, the court can weigh the equities and the righteousness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| existing between the property owner, KCDC, and the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1336)|
| 0:22:24| I think that's my major, my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| There may be some other things I could add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| I wanted to say one thing, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| I've given you some copies of photographs of Vestal area, some businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| I think they show that we don't have a blighted community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| There is blight in the area, in the residential area, but that's not included in this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1360)|
| 0:22:47| Fifteen more seconds, Mr. Honduras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| I'd like to point out further that the object of this plan is clearly stated on page 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| that the object is to take property and give it to a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| So we have some serious problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| If you want an honest government, require developer or the property owner to come in beforehand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1383)|
| 0:23:10| not after the plan is initiated, beforehand to apply for a development of that area that's in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Everything being above board and honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| I appreciate Mr. Honduras' statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| I would say just for counsel's benefit that Ms. Emily Dills had intended to come tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| but she was sick and couldn't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| She wanted to come and speak in favor of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| In response to what Mr. Honduras has said, I think his concerns are legitimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| Anyone's concerns about the status of their property ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1425)|
| 0:23:52| and the potential risks thereof under a redevelopment plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| and the threat of eminent domain are always real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| and are always on the table and, therefore, have to be taken seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| I think if you look at the plan as it's been amended and put before counsel in reflection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| it's actually not what counsel amended last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| So I think we will actually have to adopt the amended version, approve the amended version in order to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| And Mr. Swanson can clarify that because Mr. Becker proposed language last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| which his counsel passed to amend the plan, and then the postponement occurred after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| Since that time, Mr. Mamentoff, who is, I believe, in the back back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| and I'm sure would be happy to come up and speak to counsel if asked to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| Mr. Mamentoff has gone back and reviewed the statutory requirements under the state law that governs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1481)|
| 0:24:48| and has worked with the language to try to reflect Mr. Becker's amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| Councilman Becker's amendment in a way that really does fit and works legally under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| And so with that, I think I would like to hear from Mr. Mamentoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1501)|
| 0:25:09| Could you come forward, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| While he's coming forward, let me just say to you that what is before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| the plan that is attached to this resolution is what you will be voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| It is not exactly how it was as amended by Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| But because this is a resolution, it's not an ordinance coming for second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| The resolution, should you choose to pass it, will be with what the plan that is currently attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1530)|
| 0:25:38| If you wanted to change it back to the exact words that Mr. Becker stated, which I don't think he's going to propose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| but if that's what you wanted to do, you would need to amend this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| Because what you have before you tonight in the information that was previously distributed to you is what you're voting on at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1547)|
| 0:26:00| Mr. Mamentoff, could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| My name is Mark Mamentoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| I live at 1215 Great Oaks Way, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| And I'm outside counsel for KCDC, Knoxville's Community Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| And after the last meeting, the staff at KCDC did ask me to revise the language under the heading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1572)|
| 0:26:20| redevelopment process to reflect some of the comments that were made at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| Largely, the last paragraph of the section was rewritten to have a process somewhat similar to what was in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| South Knoxville Waterfront Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| Essentially, what the process does, as we've done in other cases, is if KCDC determines that a piece of property is blighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1597)|
| 0:26:48| and should be redeveloped, the first person they go to is the owner of the property and to seek proposals from the owner to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1608)|
| 0:26:55| redevelop their own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| They never go to an outside developer first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| It's very clear in the redevelopment plan that the first person gone to is the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| The owner of the property is given ample opportunity to submit a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| The plan goes through the advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| They can discuss it with the advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| It then goes to KCDC's board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| It would only, KCDC would only seek proposals from other, a developer or some other person, a third party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1633)|
| 0:27:22| if the property owner refused to submit a plan, submitted a plan or submitted a plan that was not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1642)|
| 0:27:30| They would not exercise this paragraph that we added, which I think is the key paragraph that you're interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| They would not exercise the right to condemn the property under the redevelopment statute without coming back to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1655)|
| 0:27:43| if the property owner so requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| So if it goes to KCDC's board and KCDC's board makes, they first have to have a finding that they think it's in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1665)|
| 0:27:53| best interest of the redevelopment area to acquire the property by eminent domain if they could not successfully negotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| a voluntary sale of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| It would then come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| That is not required, as you know, by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| It is purely voluntary and contractual under this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| Some of you have asked me at prior hearings, do I think that's enforceable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| It has not been tested by a court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| I believe that the redevelopment plan would be interpreted as a contractual obligation between KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| and Citi and that both the property owner and Citi could enforce it if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| But again, I would be misleading you if I told you it has been tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| But we certainly, certainly the staff's view and the commissioner's view at KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| they have every intent obviously to comply with the redevelopment plans that you all approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| So I hope that that will address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| I'm sure Mr. Becker's language was absolutely marvelous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| And I only tinkered with it modestly, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| But, you know, lawyers, they like to feel like they put their stamp on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| But anyway, the last paragraph is really the key paragraph for that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| So glad to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| I just wanted to follow up on that first if you'll allow me, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| I think the key here is, in going back to Mr. Hondulis' concerns about honesty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| and transparency in government and accountability in government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| I think the key here is that any condemnation action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| unless the property owner didn't request it, would come back to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| And that is the key safeguard and the safety valve in here to prevent any kind of abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| and to see to it that KCDC is not sort of on their own and can do whatever they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1771)|
| 0:29:39| Not that they haven't had a good track record, I think, in recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| They've not shown any tendency to be abusive in these cases that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| But if you look at the Jackson Avenue redevelopment area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| I think it's evident that they have been over backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| Typically so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| But even so, I think the concern is legitimate that the property owner's rights be respected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| And I can think of no better body to oversee that than this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| And I'll point out to council that really it's our call, this council's call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| whether it's a present membership or future membership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| because one way or the other, even if we were to impose different language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| whether it be dilapidated or whatever, a future council can come back and amend that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| So if we talk about what control we have over what future councils can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| the truth is we do not have control over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| We can only control what this council does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| But we have absolute control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| So if we trust the judgment, our own judgment, the judgment of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| then I think we have pretty much ironclad protection for the rights of the property owners within this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1842)|
| 0:30:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| Yeah, I guess to agree with Mr. Alquist, this does bring everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| Any seizure of property will come to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| I like actually Mr. Mametoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| While my language was brilliant, you've topped that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| Mine actually had an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| Yours is actually we have to make a positive decision if the property owner requests it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| which actually makes a little stronger protection for the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| And I appreciate that and want to thank you for the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| Well, I'm not an attorney, so I'm going to ask Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| Is that a true statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| Is what a true statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| What Councilman Becker just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| That this is stronger language than saying given the property owner the right to appeal to council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| That's one of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| Because I think we're in the eye of the beholder, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| I don't know whether I could say that it was stronger or whether it was not stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| That depends on how you regard it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| It is different than the language that he proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| but I don't think I would be in a position to say whether it was stronger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| or whether the other was stronger in terms of protection to the property holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| It just really depends on what the property holder thinks about that probably more than anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1923)|
| 0:32:09| How did you come up with this language versus using what you used in the South Mockville Waterfront Plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| I'd be glad to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| Honestly, and Mr. Hill is right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| He can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| He actually used the appeal language, and I commented on that, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| and it was a little bit late in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| I honestly think appeal, the word appeal is generally used in a court judicial context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| and has technical legal meaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| There is no appeal rights under the statute to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| I think it's somewhat misleading to actually say there is truly an appeal right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| because it gives the sense to the property owner that there is the right of appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| with all the inherent due process that goes along with the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| I tried to word it more as an approval right to make it more of a contractual obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| that I thought would be more likely to be enforced in court and not rejected by court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| as saying there is no appeal right in the statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| and therefore you really don't have the authority to put it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| So I was actually trying to strengthen this language even over what was in the South Mocks Waterfront Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| I think it's enforceable as well, but I think it's even more likely that this language is better suited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1984)|
| 0:33:11| if it ever came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| So that was my thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| It was intended to make it stronger, not weaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| I know at the last meeting where we had the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| there was some discussion about blotted versus dilapidated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| And I think that that's something that's very important because in this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| if and when we approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| we are taking people's property rights and assigning some of those rights to KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| And I think that's something we should look at very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| whether it be KCDC or anybody else, that we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| these are when you start messing around with people's property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| to me that's a very serious thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| And when you use the word blotted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| I think everybody here that has ever heard the definition of blotted would agree that you could just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| about say any building in this town is blotted because it's so vague and open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| Dilapidated is a lot more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| And I think that's something very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| And I think a lot of these property owners over here who are in this area could sleep a lot better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| with that definition versus the definition of blotted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| And I didn't see anything that they did in this rewrite of this little section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| that even addressed the blotted versus dilapidated at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Yes, Mayor, just to pick up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| During the South Waterfront development process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| I think we had a good healthy discussion on both of the issues of the appeal process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| and dilapidated versus blotted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| And KCDC and Mr. Mamentoff were very, very easy to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| And I think we resolved that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| I'm just wondering, why wouldn't we do the same thing there if for no other reason just to be consistent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| Are there any reasons why we wouldn't do that, Mr. Mamentoff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| Well, the two separate issues that you just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| I think the dilapidated, narrowing the right for us to use to acquire property as we're allowed to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2109)|
| 0:35:15| on a redevelopment and to only dilapidate, that's a policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| And that's up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| If you want us to change this back to dilapidated, we're glad to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| That's really your all's call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| Whatever you feel comfortable with, we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| Going back to the second point is I think this is better language than what was in the South Waterfront Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| That's your all's call, though, again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| And we're glad to put it back that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| You know, and I just want to clarify that, you know, a lot of people are concerned about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| and I believe and I think we do that most of us that there ought to be an appeal process where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2141)|
| 0:35:48| they can come to us or whomever if they don't like what KCDC has to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2148)|
| 0:35:57| And then people are a whole lot more comfortable with dilapidated versus, you know, more vague term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2157)|
| 0:36:04| And I just want to make sure from Mr. Swanson, you know, that and I have the minutes from last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| and I know Mr. Becker, his language, I have it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| And, you know, we voted on that and passed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2173)|
| 0:36:20| And then, of course, the next thing is we did postpone it for four weeks to get the language of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| or have some more discussion on dilapidated versus blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| So I would like Mr. Swanson just to weigh in here and help us do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2190)|
| 0:36:39| If you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| If this language, if you think that Mr. Mametoff language covers that or do we need to go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| South Waterfront language or, you know, how can we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| It frankly seems to me that the argument is mostly a semantic argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| I think ultimately you all are going to be vested with the decision that is made here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| I think that is the protection that you are asking to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| And I think in either sets of whether the wording as it was before or whether the wording is as it is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2227)|
| 0:37:17| I think ultimately you folks, this body, is the body that makes the ultimate decision on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| And I think that's the protection that is afforded by this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| Whether that is more ably accomplished by the language that was in the South Waterfront plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| or whether that is more ably accomplished by the language that is currently before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2253)|
| 0:37:41| I frankly don't have a real opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| I will say that Mr. Mametoff has greater expertise than do I in the area of redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2263)|
| 0:37:50| and in the area of redevelopment plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| I thought I heard him say that providing for this more of a contractual right than an appeal process is more likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2274)|
| 0:38:03| to be found valid by a court should it be challenged in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| I think that I heard him say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| And if that's the case, I would certainly defer to his judgment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| But I think that essentially what it comes down to is how is this decision ultimately going to be made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2293)|
| 0:38:22| And I think what you have come up with with either plan is that the decision to acquire other folks' property is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2302)|
| 0:38:30| made in the last instance by this body and then with an appeal to the court process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2310)|
| 0:38:37| So I think that we're really in a semantic battle here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2317)|
| 0:38:44| And I don't know if that answers your question or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| I think the easiest way to do this as it stands right now, and I'm eager to hear my colleagues' comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| but it's just to insert the language from the South Waterfront into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| But I'll wait and see what they have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| I think Councilman Becker was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| I was actually going to go back to the question of, well, I guess I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| Again, I think this is stronger language than what I came up with because in the event of a tie, this is an affirmative vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2346)|
| 0:39:13| Four votes in an appeal would allow property to be condemned in the case of a tie, and it won't this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| So I think it is procedurally a stronger position because of what might happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| And I think Mr. Swanson is right that we're making this decision and this body is going to make the right decision on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2364)|
| 0:39:31| Councilman Woodhull, I'll go with you next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Actually, it seems to me that it is a little bit more than semantics in the sense that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| and I'm curious to hear what you think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| I mean, a vacant lot can't be dilapidated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| So this actually, this change in language shifts the strength or the, maybe not the strength,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2386)|
| 0:39:56| but the way in which this proposal moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| I was actually addressing the language about whether it's an appeal process or whether it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| through the process that Mr. Mametoff named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| I wasn't really talking about the dilapidation versus blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| There is a difference between those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| The definition is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| And as Mr. Mametoff said there, that's a policy issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| You decide whether you want the language to be dilapidation or whether you want the language to be blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| I apologize that I didn't realize we were lumping those two together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| But if your issue is whether it's dilapidation or blight, indeed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| there is a difference there between those two concepts as they are defined in the language itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2435)|
| 0:40:42| And so I think that there are policy reasons to go with blight rather than dilapidation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2442)|
| 0:40:48| By the same token, there are policy reasons why you might choose to go with dilapidation rather than blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| But that's really not a legal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| That's a policy issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| Councilman Hochlist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| Well, I think it's pretty clear in my mind, based on what I've heard, that the language in terms of appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2461)|
| 0:41:10| versus the way Mr. Mametoff has it worded, that his wording is at least as good and probably stronger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2470)|
| 0:41:17| as Councilman Becker said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| As far as the issue of the terminology of blight versus dilapidation, I think it's really clear in my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2479)|
| 0:41:28| and I hope that Council will begin to see it this way also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| If you limit it to dilapidation, as Councilman Woodhull indicated, then you can't deal with vacant lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2492)|
| 0:41:40| Dilapidation only applies to buildings and structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| And it also doesn't address the issue of when you don't have a clear chain of title, I believe is the proper terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2505)|
| 0:41:53| And this has happened in one example we've seen downtown in the not-too-distant past is the Millers Building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2513)|
| 0:42:00| where that building actually sat on different parcels and the ownership was clouded enough in terms of the chain of title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2520)|
| 0:42:11| and whether or not the heirs and successors could even be found and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| And it looked like it could never be cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| And so it had to be dealt with using the redevelopment tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| And we may very well run into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| One of the key differences between Vestal and this commercial area in Vestal and the South Waterfront is that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2547)|
| 0:42:34| South Waterfront redevelopment will be driven primarily by market forces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| Vestal is not to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| If we use the language of dilapidation, we will probably hamstring this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| And if we're going to do that, then we might as well just not do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| We either are going to have an effective redevelopment process in Vestal or we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| But this is not the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| And the market forces that are in play there will not be in play here, at least not for the foreseeable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| Hopefully, we'll get to the point where the market forces will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| But in the meantime, we have properties that are de facto abandoned that have got to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2588)|
| 0:43:16| And I think this tool is the only way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| So I would encourage council to support this with the language that Mr. Mammoth has put before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| Well, I have some questions about the vacant lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| Are these vacant lots that we would consider blighted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| Are people paying taxes on those lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| You give these kind of or that's been mentioned, these vacant lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| What is happening with these vacant lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| I mean, I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| If I own a piece of property and just because I don't want to develop it, why should I have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2634)|
| 0:44:01| Are you asking me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| Or anybody that knows, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| Well, in one case, I know of a lot that, a rather large lot that hasn't had taxes paid on it since 1994.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2646)|
| 0:44:14| But see, that puts forth there is a method already in place to deal with that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2654)|
| 0:44:22| It should have been sold already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| Under tax sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| It was colored because of contamination and other problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| And so, no one wanted to deal with it on a tax sale basis because they weren't sure if that was the most appropriate way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| Whereas, KCDC has the tools and is used to dealing with the remediation of contaminated property and property that's problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2674)|
| 0:44:43| So, KCDC is in a better position to address issues like that than the people who handle the tax attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2683)|
| 0:44:54| and the people that handle those kinds of properties through tax sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| Again, it's not that we couldn't address any of these problems at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| It's that this is a better way and gives us more tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| But again, nothing happens unless this council approves such action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| Well, part of the reasoning for my objective would like to see dilapidation versus blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| That frees up, gives people a mental state that they're not constantly concerned about the taking of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2718)|
| 0:45:30| And I'm not accusing KCDC of going around saying, well, we'll get this one tomorrow and this one next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| But it is, they do have the authority to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| And I think we have to be real careful giving that unbridled authority away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| And when you have an area here, like we're talking about in Vestal, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2746)|
| 0:45:53| from the conversations I've heard in these council meetings, we're really going to redevelop a very small area compared to the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2753)|
| 0:46:01| to which is encompassed in this redevelopment district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2761)|
| 0:46:08| I don't know if Councilman Baker is over here shaking his head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| But, you know, we decided that some of the money can only be spent in a small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| But the redevelopment area is the redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| There are two separate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| First, I don't agree with the either or proposition that Councilman Hoek was just put out, either do it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2786)|
| 0:46:36| I want to say that to understand that's not why I'm going to the position I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| You know, after hearing what Mr. Mamentoff has said and what Councilman Hoek has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| I, too, in my district have some of the same issues and problems that he has to face when it relates to trying to develop areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2804)|
| 0:46:52| that have been allowed to go down in dilapidation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| You have absentee landlords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| You have vacant lots that folk won't clean up or they'll pay their property taxes to stay one year away from the going to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2817)|
| 0:47:05| tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| And those become real problems when you're trying to develop an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| And I am, as one of the people who last time spoke to why not make it consistent with the South Knox Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2832)|
| 0:47:20| after hearing what Mr. Mamentoff has put in and his language here, I feel very comfortable now going with even leaving the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2840)|
| 0:47:28| definition of blight now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| I did have the big concern about dilapidation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| But now understanding that the process and not an appeal process, I think I asked a question last time about appeal process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| and the KCDC and what all that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| But now looking at your language, Mr. Mamentoff, and hearing what we have, I feel very comfortable that ultimately the question of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2861)|
| 0:47:48| any property owner who has concerns, who fits in the factual scenario that Councilman Hall has put forth, can come to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| and say, wait a minute, I've got my property taxes up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| You know, you're calling my vacant lot blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| But in actuality, just because I don't want to put a structure on it doesn't mean you're going to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| And that would be a full-bodied hearing before this board here, this Council, which would really, I think, follow some good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| Somebody walks in in your scenario, Councilman Hall, and, you know, I cut my grass every once in a while, but my taxes are paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| and it's my property, so why are you taking it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| So I think we've got that safeguard here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| And I like the languages here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| The only question I have, Mr. Mamentoff, is it says within 30 days, if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| of when KCDC Board of Commissioners approves the acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| That is assuming, I guess, that KCDC, at the time it approves the acquisition, the property owner is going to know at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2913)|
| 0:48:40| particular period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| The only question I have here is a timing mechanism now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| If you've got a property owner who's not at that meeting, that board meeting, or gets noticed, you know, by the mail three weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2924)|
| 0:48:52| later, and now they have a one-week window to try to get to this Council, how do we kind of handle that kind of scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2932)|
| 0:48:58| if we've got a property owner who maybe is not there and doesn't get the full thrust of using 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2938)|
| 0:49:05| That's the only thing that kind of jumps out at me to make sure to protect the property owner's ability to get it before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2945)|
| 0:49:12| That's a pretty good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| In the land acquisition policy, which is later in the document, under our already existing land acquisition policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2953)|
| 0:49:20| we're required to give, even before we start the voluntary negotiation process, an intent to acquire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| And so the property owner is notified very early in the process that there is, if there is any intent on KCDC's part to acquire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2966)|
| 0:49:36| their property, so they would learn it very early on in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| Well, that's intent versus approval to acquire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| And I'm sorry, I was trying to read through here quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| And I'm glad that, and again, if it would honestly not really thought through carefully through the issue you just raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| we're glad to get further notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| I don't know if Mr. Tiller is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| I don't know what our actual practice is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| But I know that the few acquisitions we've had to do, for example, on Marcos Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| we gave innumerable notices before we did anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| And the only time we took any action was when we couldn't get anyone to pay any attention to us essentially whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| That's just the big thing that kind of jumps out at me at this juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| I'm comfortable now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| I think we've got to get best to moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| And the same issues that affect Councilman Holquist and his points are the same ones that affect a lot of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| redevelopment activities that we're trying to do in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| And I think now we actually, through a lot of trial and error, have a document here that I think is going to be beneficial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| is going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| And I just want to put on the record that that's my only little quirk there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| about the possibility there is somebody may not get enough notice to get before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| That's a good point, and we'll be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| Again, I would like to reiterate that I thought what was in the South Knox Waterfront Plan was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| Obviously, I see it as my job each time to do something to see if we can do it a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| And that's all I was really trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| I do believe because this is an approval which requires a majority vote versus an appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| that this actually is more protective of the property owner's rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| There really was no intent to weaken that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| When it comes to this dilapidation versus blighted, I'd just like to remind this body that my recollection and the debate on it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3077)|
| 0:51:28| that we heard from residents over in the South Knoxville area on the waterfront that they were concerned about issues like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3088)|
| 0:51:36| well, you know, blighted is a vague term and, you know, should I work on my house or should I not work on my house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| They could come in here any day and tear my, you know, take my house away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| And it was sort of the fear factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| And I heard Mr. Hill talk about what the intent of the city is when you go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| Now, like an empty lot is one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| But I think what we're really talking about, you know, is what is the intent of KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3117)|
| 0:52:04| and what do the residents think of what we're trying to do over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| So I think that, you know, I have a responsibility to look out for the residents that aren't here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3127)|
| 0:52:13| And I don't think it's that big of a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| And I think we ought to be consistent with what we're doing over on the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| And, you know, it's not going to – I'm not going to jump in the river on the way home if we don't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3139)|
| 0:52:26| But I just don't know why we can't be consistent and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| insert that term in there that we did on the south waterfront development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| So that's where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| And, you know, I'm going to make the motion to try to insert that in there at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3156)|
| 0:52:43| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| The motion is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| So I guess I'd like to make the motion to change the word from blight to dilapidated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| I guess I just need to weigh in that I agree with Councilman Woodhall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| I'm concerned that moving this plan to dilapidated from blighted is going to weaken the intent of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3184)|
| 0:53:11| particularly in the case of empty lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| So I can't support that amendment because I think it's a good plan with good intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3194)|
| 0:53:22| And I think this area deserves to see some improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| And I think if we weaken our language to the point that we can't make progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| then there's no point in having it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| Mr. Bailey, could I ask you to clarify the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| You want to change the word to dilapidation as defined in the South Waterfront redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3215)|
| 0:53:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| And you want to include that definition as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| I think that clarifies it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| Mr. Mamentopoulos, will you understand what that means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| And can you make the necessary changes to cause that to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| It sort of ripples through that whole section, so it's not just like that in one word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| But it certainly easily can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| And if we were --if it was intended that we have done it for the --I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| I had understood that we were supposed to add these essentially approval rights or appeal rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| whatever you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| I did not understand we were supposed to limit the blighted definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| I don't think you were required to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| I don't think that's what the previous amendment was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| But that's what's being asked right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| And that's what the proposed amendment is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| And you could accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| You understand what the motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| And you could accomplish that in the drafting of the redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| Ms. Peel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| I just wanted to rather echo Councilman Roddy's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| When I received this document, I was very pleased with the new language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| And I do feel that it supports what is trying to be accomplished there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| I'm very impressed with the appeal process to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| And I really think Mr. Mametoff's language is very strong and sends a very clear message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| And I think it has met the needs that this council has to protect the property owners there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| which is very important to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| However, it's also very important that we have a very strong document that is going to provide the opportunity for redevelopment in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3309)|
| 0:55:17| So I will continue to support the language that was presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| I can't support the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3323)|
| 0:55:24| Yeah, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| I'm just, you know, I just think that I like to hope that we would be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3325)|
| 0:55:33| And I'd like to treat all areas the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| And, you know, I didn't hear the empty lot theory, you know, when we were talking about the south waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3335)|
| 0:55:42| And I hear it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| I don't know really what kind of empty lots we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| I really don't know how that plays into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| But nonetheless, if somebody would like to publicly or privately explain that to me, I'd be interested in hearing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3350)|
| 0:55:59| You know, what's the difference in the two areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3359)|
| 0:56:06| Which two areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| The south waterfront development and the Vestal area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| Well, I heard Councilman Holquist mention a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3370)|
| 0:56:16| He said one was market driven and, I mean, they have two very different characters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| With the south waterfront, Councilman Bailey, you have an area that if you talk to any of the commercial property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3382)|
| 0:56:30| and industrial property owners in there now, they're being approached by multiple developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| people who want to buy their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| So it's a buyer's, I mean, it's a seller's market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| And there's so much pressure, there's so much market pressure to sell for high dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| Properties have gone from, oh, maybe $300,000, something thousand dollars an acre a couple of years ago on the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3407)|
| 0:56:55| to probably in excess of a million dollars an acre already and values continue to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3415)|
| 0:57:01| The market pressures are so great that there's no need for any other intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3421)|
| 0:57:08| Whereas you have a situation in Vestal where you have deteriorating conditions, deteriorating property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| things that have sat fallow, buildings and vacant lots have sat fallow for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| and a demand from the community to see something happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| Now, you know, people want to protect the flip side, as you hear, both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| We want something to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| You know, we've been promised this for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| The other side of the coin is, you know, we don't want government coming in and just taking away our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3453)|
| 0:57:41| And I think this plan answers both of those desires on the part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3461)|
| 0:57:48| I hope that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3470)|

| 0:58:21| Mr. Swanson, do we need to make any change in that back to the question that Mr. Holt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3505)|

| 1:00:03| for work they've already been working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| I guess in the hard work that they've been doing on a lot of these issues here that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3604)|
| 1:00:10| very important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3610)|

| 1:00:16| and hopefully we don't get down the line, and I guess I need to say this on the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3616)|

| 1:02:12| I worked on this years ago when it was a serious problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3732)|

| 1:02:21| And I just really appreciate the updating of this code and the effort to educate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3741)|
| 1:02:27| I think that's one of the important things, is the effort to educate the public and let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| them know just how much of a problem this is for the department and how many man hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| are wasted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| So I appreciate the work that was done on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=3756)|

| 1:11:17| the other three lots that the Woggles control now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| So it's a very small rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4280)|

| 1:13:21| It's less than a third of an acre, as I recall, or about that, that is inside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4401)|
| 1:13:28| It is surrounded by property that is in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4408)|
| 1:13:33| It's part of an overall development which has been approved as a use on review and concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4413)|
| 1:13:40| The property that's in the county was rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| The plan was submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| And during the course of the plan, I think it was discovered that this one-third acre had not been forwarded to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4425)|
| 1:13:51| city council for action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| We currently have an approved plan for development of an apartment complex on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4435)|
| 1:14:05| And the permitting process is, if you will, underway to do grading work and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4445)|
| 1:14:18| Currently a portion of two buildings, a small portion of two buildings, would be located within the confines of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4458)|
| 1:14:27| boundary of what is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| We have a development plan that involves our getting this property ready to start offering it to tenants on a time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4472)|
| 1:14:45| that delay at this point is extremely detrimental to the overall project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4485)|
| 1:14:55| What we've asked for here is a rezoning of this property from R1 to RP1 at up to 5.99 dwelling units to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4495)|
| 1:15:05| which will allow us to go forward with our current plans for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| I don't know that I understand what the purpose of a four-week delay is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4510)|
| 1:15:19| I think really it's a pretty straightforward situation in that the property surrounding it is zoned at a density that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4519)|
| 1:15:28| exceeds the 5.99 we're seeking here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| The overall, as I say, the overall development, which is about 35 acres, has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4532)|
| 1:15:39| We'd like to get this rezoned so we can go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| I've met with Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| Sometimes the two of us agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| Sometimes we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| This one we happen to have a difference of opinion about this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| I think that the rezoning is straightforward and would request that it be voted on and approved tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4556)|
| 1:16:06| Councilman Holquist has, in a rather straightforward fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| told me that he doesn't support or will not support the rezoning of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| absent my client's agreement to bring the remainder of the property by voluntary annexation into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4575)|
| 1:16:24| I have told him in response to that that that's the subject of a lawsuit right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| Sooner or later, a decision will be made in that lawsuit, and it will either be in the city or it won't be in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4589)|
| 1:16:34| But we're not in a position to agree to put 35 acres in at this time as a condition to getting this one-third acre rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4594)|
| 1:16:43| I would ask respectfully that you deny the request or the motion to postpone as I see it being, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4603)|
| 1:16:56| a deal killer to the proposed development in its current form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| And I would ask that contrary to the wishes of Mr. Holquist that the rezoning be approved as requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4620)|
| 1:17:12| I know that we have a representative here from MPC who is familiar with the history of how we got where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4632)|
| 1:17:21| and why we are where we are now, but I think I have stated it fairly accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4641)|
| 1:17:28| I'll try to answer any questions, but I would respectfully ask this body not to postpone the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4648)|
| 1:17:35| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| Well, counsel, to me, I guess I'm a little confused as to why the applicant was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4656)|
| 1:17:46| What I understood from Mr. King and the applicant indirectly through Mr. King is that the applicant has no problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4666)|
| 1:17:53| with coming into the city after all of their rezonings and approvals come through on the county side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4673)|
| 1:18:00| and they get their project essentially sealed and done under what they believe to be rules that are easier for them to live with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4680)|
| 1:18:12| or whatever the best terminology might be to describe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| They sued for that reason so that they could prevent the annexation, which this council approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4697)|
| 1:18:25| but have indicated that they have no problem coming into the city after their project is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4705)|
| 1:18:30| and they are no longer subject to the rules and regulations of the city in the permitting and construction of their project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4710)|
| 1:18:39| And then they turn around and come to this council and because of this one small parcel that is in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4719)|
| 1:18:45| they want it rezoned in order to expedite their project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| which they have permitted under what they believe to be less onerous rules perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4729)|
| 1:18:56| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| I guess I'm a bit confused and that's why I'd like to postpone this so that we can get a better understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4738)|
| 1:19:06| of what the differences are and what exactly it is that they hope to accomplish by this rezoning in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4746)|
| 1:19:14| that is contrary to what they thought they could not accomplish or thought they could accomplish, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4754)|
| 1:19:23| Or couldn't accomplish if they had come into the city with the rest of the 35 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| and had to permit everything under city rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4768)|
| 1:19:32| I see that as confusing and I think the best way to deal with it perhaps is to clarify it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4772)|
| 1:19:38| is to postpone until such time as we can talk with the applicant and get some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4778)|
| 1:19:46| So, Mr. King, I didn't ask you to make any statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| I'm talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| Mr. King, could you please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| Mr. King, Mr. King, no one asked you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| We have a couple of other lights on if one of the other council members has something to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| And certainly if I have something I want to hear from Mr. King, I'll ask him also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4801)|
| 1:20:07| But I think that's the situation that I see us in is that this council has been asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4807)|
| 1:20:15| this council took annexation action that was challenged by this applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| Now they've turned around and asked this council for something that doesn't really seem to fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| And so I think the best thing to do would be to postpone until we can get that straightened out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| and get a better, a clearer idea from them exactly what it is they're trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| Mr. King, let me first ask you a yes-no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| Do you have a brief statement you'd like to make in response to Mr. Holquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| Do I have a brief statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| Something short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| We're looking at maybe being here until midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| So can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| I can try to be as brief as I can be, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| I'll take that as a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| Would you like to respond to Mr. Holquist and say something briefly before I ask you another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| I'm sorry if he misunderstood what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| What I pointed out to him was that at the time the city started annexation of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| a discussion was held with representatives of the administration to try to work out something about withholding that action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4866)|
| 1:21:13| or withdrawing that action in exchange for which a discussion could take place about a point in time when they might voluntarily come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4873)|
| 1:21:22| That request was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| And the city said they were going forward with the annexation on their timetable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| Consequent to that, other decisions were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| Other actions had to be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| That proposal went by the boards and was not acted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| I have not said nor represented now that there is a point in time when we're willing to come into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4899)|
| 1:21:47| I respectfully disagree that that was the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4910)|
| 1:21:51| Let me ask you another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| I know you've had some discussions with Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| I know you were also hoping to meet with Mr. Emmett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| Do you have something set with Mr. Emmett, with the city already, to discuss this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| Or is there just a plan to get together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| At the suggestion of you, sir, I contacted Rick Emmett to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4927)|
| 1:22:15| I think I understand correctly that it is his position essentially that the opportunity to talk to the city about anything would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4935)|
| 1:22:26| limited to at what point in time will we agree to come into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4946)|
| 1:22:32| So you're not planning on meeting with Mr. Emmett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| At the moment, I do not believe there's anything worthwhile of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| I was actually assuming that was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| I was going to ask Mr. Holquist if we would reduce the time of the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| But since you're not willing to talk, that doesn't seem to be a factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| I would be willing to consider that, Councilman Becker, under the right circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| I'm sorry, I don't know whose light was next, but I'll go with Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| I have a question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| Why is MPC the applicant on this particular request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| Well, if you'll notice the configuration of this land, it's a finger annexation down Eddington to a small parcel, about a third of an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4982)|
| 1:23:12| And the balance of the property was in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| And when we got our application, we took it to Reddit as if all of the property were in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=4996)|
| 1:23:23| So we simply didn't process an application in the city until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| So MPC is the applicant to correct what MPC saw as an oversight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5015)|
| 1:23:36| Ms. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5016)|
| 1:23:37| I want to ask Mr. King a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| So I just don't mean to belabor Councilman Becker's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| but reducing the suggested four-week postponement to a two-week postponement probably isn't going to make a difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5023)|
| 1:23:50| I do not represent this client in the currently pending lawsuit contesting the annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5030)|
| 1:23:59| I represent this client in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| My discussions with them are to be essentially informed that they are not willing to voluntarily give up their lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5041)|
| 1:24:09| and voluntarily be annexed into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5049)|
| 1:24:16| And I think a coupling of the two is not necessarily appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5056)|
| 1:24:23| It ought to be the question, a rather straightforward question, whether or not the requested zoning is appropriate or not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5063)|
| 1:24:33| I think obviously some others have a different view from me, but that's sort of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5073)|
| 1:24:40| I would be, you know me, I'm always willing to sit down and discuss, talk about matters, especially when I'm getting paid to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5080)|
| 1:24:47| When I understand that the parameters are, you've got to tell us when you're going to voluntarily drop your lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5087)|
| 1:24:55| and come into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| And I have a client who says, I'm not willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| I question the real need to sit down and have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5099)|
| 1:25:08| Second question, does Garrett Meek live on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5108)|
| 1:25:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5117)|
| 1:25:18| You know, after listening to everything, I don't know if postponement is going to do any good or if we should do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5118)|
| 1:25:24| And while this may sound a little counter to, you know, we having reached out to annex this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5124)|
| 1:25:31| I'm a little uncomfortable with holding up this development that looks like it's moving forward based on a third of an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5131)|
| 1:25:38| even though we're attempting to annex it and basically kind of holding them hostage at this juncture with regards to that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5138)|
| 1:25:45| What do you plan on doing with this one third of an acre that is in the city, Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5145)|
| 1:25:51| This is attached units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| It's an apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| Currently, the plans show, if you will, portions of the ends of two separate buildings extending into the boundaries of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5156)|
| 1:26:07| Additionally, I think there's about like 16 to 18 parking spaces on that property along a driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5167)|
| 1:26:15| But, you know, a portion of two buildings extend into the boundaries of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5175)|
| 1:26:22| This piece of property is, if you will, right in the middle of the frontage along Eddington Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5182)|
| 1:26:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5189)|
| 1:26:30| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| Well, you know, Mr. King said that this should stand on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| And I think any zoning has to be, rezoning has to be considered in the context of what's happening around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5199)|
| 1:26:46| Rezonings aren't happening on parcels of land suspended in space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| They have property around them and things happening around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| And I think that council understands that, that we always consider rezoning based on the context of what's happening in the adjacent area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5214)|
| 1:27:03| and how that might impact it and how that interrelates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| I think it's very appropriate to consider what's happening on the adjacent property and try to determine that as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5226)|
| 1:27:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| Right now, the motion on the floor is to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5237)|
| 1:27:25| We're seeing no other light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| Excuse me, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5248)|
| 1:27:29| I don't mean to jump in, but is there any benefit to simply asking for a two-week postponement to see if?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5249)|
| 1:27:36| I would be willing to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| I mean, I kind of understand the leash that Mr. King's been put on by his client and just trying to come out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5258)|
| 1:27:47| let's see if we can split the baby here a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| So I'd make a friendly amendment to a two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| I'll accept that, a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| Will the second accept that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| The motion right now is to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| Mr. Brown, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| I'm glad to see we took it down to two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| I'll probably support this, but I'm real uncomfortable with kind of how we're moving along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5289)|
| 1:28:14| and what we're doing here with 35 acres of property and using a third of an acre to really stop development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5294)|
| 1:28:21| that certainly is going to be good development, even though it's going to be on the county side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| But in the interest of hopefully having that conversation, which I think is what Councilman Holquist wants to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| is have a conversation, see if there can be a win-win for everybody, I'll support this two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5315)|
| 1:28:36| Ms. Peele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5316)|
| 1:28:37| I just wanted to ask Mr. Donaldson, is it possible that somebody can explain to me over the next two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5317)|
| 1:28:43| how this little piece of property came to be in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5323)|
| 1:28:49| So sometime within the next two weeks, do you want to, or is it just a simple two-sentence answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5329)|
| 1:28:57| Perhaps Rick Emmett could provide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| Rick Emmett is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5339)|
| 1:29:00| Rick, do you know the answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| I don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5343)|
| 1:29:04| I know it's late and I know a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5344)|
| 1:29:05| Real quick, Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| If you could hurry, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| These folks are going to be here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| Sorry, Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5349)|
| 1:29:10| But I just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| Rick Emmett, City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| This is in the context of all the annexations we did in the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| Voluntary property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| If I recall, it was a fireman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| Had a house out there on Eddington Road, more than the city, and we brought it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5366)|
| 1:29:27| Mr. Batley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5367)|
| 1:29:28| I just want to ask Mr. King, do you think we can accomplish anything in the next couple of weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5368)|
| 1:29:36| I suppose that depends on how reasonable Councilman Holquist is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5376)|
| 1:29:44| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| That's totally reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| And I guess I'm going to be the judge of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5386)|
| 1:29:53| Hope springs eternal, Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| I sense, if you will, the attitude of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| I have serious reservations about it, but I understand the interest of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5403)|
| 1:30:09| I'm not going to stand here and tell you, you know, no, don't do two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5409)|
| 1:30:13| My preference is certainly otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| My client's preference is otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| But I'm not going to put you all to the end of the limb on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5418)|
| 1:30:26| I'll sit down and have another conversation with Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| I hope you work something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| And I'll support the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| All those in favor of postponing for two weeks, signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| That takes us to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| Mr. Alonzo Montgomery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5442)|
| 1:30:54| Mr. Mayor, can we postpone public forum until after the beer brewed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5454)|
| 1:31:00| Council can do whatever it pleases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| I'd like him to pan out of here about three weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| Name and address, Mr. Montgomery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| He ought to be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| The other seven turned on the other two and gave his way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| Name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| Alonzo Montgomery, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| I only could give you all my military address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| The reason I'm here tonight, Mr. Mayor, I need two minutes, Mr. Howell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| You're going to make a good county mayor, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| You mean you're only going to take two minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| After I get through with these five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| Mr. Mayor, question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| I know you're not going to give me an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| I ran that route that y'all went down on MLK yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| and I went out and ran it about 7.15 yesterday morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| and ran from Vine to Greater Warner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| Man, your guy was out there early cleaning up that side of town, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5509)|
| 1:31:53| They ain't never been out there early cleaning up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| City trucks everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| You need to come down MLK a little more often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| Maybe something will get done, because I'm sure the residents didn't have to call 311| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| to get them out there that early yesterday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| I've never seen them out there that early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| I mean, actually cleaning the place up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| because Mayor Haslam and his gang was coming down MLK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| You know, and they didn't have to dial 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| But as I, you know, and as I ride the community every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5541)|
| 1:32:25| I got a problem with this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| because Bob Becker sat there and said a month ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| you got all this wisdom around this table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| I don't think you got that much, but okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| You know, but Mr. Mayor, on the same side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5556)|
| 1:32:40| what's going to happen with Metro Village?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| I already know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| Someone told me that this building belongs to Leroy Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| I fully disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| I know y'all got a busy night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| and we ain't going to get anywhere with this in the night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| but I want this one to be put on y'all's agenda, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| And I need to know which one of y'all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| is going to help me get it on that agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| because him and his people only put in $900,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| for that project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| when the city of Knoxville put over $7 million in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| then another million or two from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| The taxpayers got a lot of money tied up over on MLK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5594)|
| 1:33:19| See, before Leroy Thompson took that project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| I went down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| I went down to Decatur, Georgia with Mr. Woods' people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| and they were closing up the same store down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| called Metro Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| First, the grocery store part closed down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| and then the second thing, Mr. Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| the only thing they had was a convenient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| a little convenient mart and a gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| I'm saying, why don't council need to listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| to the citizens more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| Because this was a bum deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| especially if the citizens and the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| didn't have to be out of $9 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| and Leroy Thompson sitting over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| with a brand new structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| he and his company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| And I have a problem with that tonight, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| I know y'all busy, but that's the main reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| I'm here tonight, because I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| we need to talk about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| He shouldn't own that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| And he could come to me and I'd tell him in his face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| he shouldn't own that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| That was a rip-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| He got that building, and you know what's funny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| Not only did he get the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| before he got the building, y'all put his wife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| on the KUB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| And then y'all gave him $9 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| for that building over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| between you and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| I'm saying, what kind of racket is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| They put his wife on the KUB board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| and then gives him $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| Heck, he played football,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| but he wasn't no star.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| He wasn't no Jerome Bettis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| You know, he's just an ordinary citizen of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| And y'all give me one more minute, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| I'm going to get out of here, but we need to put that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| on the agenda, because that's a serious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| I joke about it, but that's a serious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| Because y'all gave him that money, Mr. Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| for a grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| And today there is not a grocery store in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| If they're not going to have a grocery store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| in that community, he need to give up that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| Point blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| Because in six months, you can't jump ship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| Most of those kind of projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| they give them 36 months to live or die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| You can't jump ship in six months, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| And, you know, but two of them I covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| The last, I want to give to the citizens of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| East Knoxville and Howard Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| You know, the community elected new NAACP official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| Pastor Mays, I don't know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| He don't know me, but I'm here to tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| he's for personal gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| I got word of this dude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| I already down there trying to get him a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| as a chaplain on the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| You know, that's a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| Can I get two minutes, Mr. Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| Let me give him two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| That's a conflict of interest if y'all hire him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| for that police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| Because he cannot, as a president of NAACP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5772)|
| 1:36:17| I'm speaking for all people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| but we know that East Knoxville have more problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| than West Knoxville with NAACP stepping out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| Even though they never stepped out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| I don't know what East Knoxville is going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| when Diane Jordan is not in office anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| because they no longer have a boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| Because no other elected official is going to stand up for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| nor is any civic organization going to stand up for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| But this guy, you know, they put him in as NAACP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| Now he's going to get a job as a chaplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| for the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| If he wasn't over at NAACP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| they wouldn't even consider him for a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| at the police department as a chaplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| Now, it's all about money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| I already know you give any of them $5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| they're going to shut up anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| I already know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| I want them to confront me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| I tell them in their face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| But I want the citizens of Knoxville to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| this dude ain't nothing but personal gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| I want to say a bit more things about the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| And if I'm wrong, I want him to call me on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| Chief Owen, aren't those police, chaplain, voluntary positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| That's how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5852)|
| 1:37:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070116?start=5863)|
