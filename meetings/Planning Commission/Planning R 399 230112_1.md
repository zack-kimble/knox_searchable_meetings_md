| 2:36:21| as they continue to look at major road improvements out in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9381)|
| 2:36:25| that they somehow maybe figure out, even if they had to elevate a little bit more of Murphy Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9385)|
| 2:36:30| to get a passageway underneath so that pedestrians could move easier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9390)|
| 2:36:34| much like I'm not equating pedestrians to cattle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9394)|
| 2:36:37| but the same way that the cattle used to be moved across the farms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9397)|
| 2:36:42| just so that there's some way of pedestrians being able to connect back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9402)|
| 2:36:46| So, I want to put that more on the county than on the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9406)|
| 2:36:49| because we're already too far down the road with all the other developments in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9409)|
| 2:36:55| The horse has already left the barn there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9415)|
| 2:36:57| I'll just stay with my farm analogies for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9417)|
| 2:37:01| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9421)|
| 2:37:03| I'd like to add an eighth condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9423)|
| 2:37:08| and that's to have the vegetative screening at the portion of this development that does front Murphy Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9428)|
| 2:37:17| to match the—someone's going to have to help me with the exact parameters of this vegetative screening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9437)|
| 2:37:24| the development that is across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9444)|
| 2:37:28| I'd just like to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9448)|
| 2:37:31| So, the parcel that we're looking at here is actually bigger than the area what they're subdividing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9451)|
| 2:37:38| The parcel extends all the way to Murphy Road, but where their concept plan is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9458)|
| 2:37:42| it doesn't touch Murphy Road, this current phase of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9462)|
| 2:37:49| You see, it's basically where that line that's going across right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9469)|
| 2:37:56| it's in alignment with the construction that's already happening, basically, so to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9476)|
| 2:38:03| That's kind of a—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9483)|
| 2:38:05| So, is that not with—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9485)|
| 2:38:08| Our concept was—the original concept was approved to where the TVA power lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9488)|
| 2:38:16| and KEB gas line run through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9496)|
| 2:38:21| We broke the original concept down into a phase one and a phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9501)|
| 2:38:26| This part, we will be finishing the phase two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9506)|
| 2:38:30| and then this new concept is tying into what will be phase two there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9510)|
| 2:38:35| So, he is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9515)|
| 2:38:37| The part that does back up to Murphy Road already does have an approved concept on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9517)|
| 2:38:51| Is that good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9531)|
| 2:38:54| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9534)|
| 2:38:55| So, we're going to have three motions on this, the first one being the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9535)|
| 2:39:03| Chairman, I'd like to make a motion to approve the requested variances per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9543)|

| 2:39:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9599)|
| 2:40:08| Next is agenda item 35, subdivision Parker's Forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9608)|
| 2:40:12| Applicant developer is Robert Campbell and Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9612)|
| 2:40:15| Location, northeast side of Greenwell Drive, northwest of Crystal Point Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9615)|
| 2:40:21| Approximate acreage, 4.09 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9621)|
| 2:40:24| Zoning, planned residential, up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9624)|
| 2:40:28| Existing land use, agriculture, forestry, vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9628)|
| 2:40:32| Proposed use, detached residential, subdivision, number of lots requested, 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9632)|
| 2:40:39| This will require variances and looks like we've got three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9639)|
| 2:40:47| The first staff recommendation is approve the variance based on the recommendations of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9647)|
| 2:40:51| Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9651)|
| 2:40:54| Second motion, recommendation, approve the concept plan subject to five conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9654)|
| 2:41:00| And then thirdly, recommendation is approve the development plan for up to 12 detached residential lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9660)|
| 2:41:06| subject to the following one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9666)|
| 2:41:09| And the applicant is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9669)|
| 2:41:11| Yes, sir. Robert Campbell, 7523 Taggart Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9671)|
| 2:41:14| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9674)|
| 2:41:17| We do have opposition. Would you like to proceed or defer, Mr. Campbell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9677)|
| 2:41:20| Defer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9680)|
| 2:41:21| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9681)|
| 2:41:22| If the opposition would come forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9682)|
| 2:41:31| If you'd state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9691)|
| 2:41:32| I'm the only one, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9692)|
| 2:41:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9693)|
| 2:41:34| Okay, unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9694)|
| 2:41:36| Hello, my name is Tracy Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9696)|
| 2:41:38| My address is 8201 Greenwell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9698)|
| 2:41:42| Good afternoon, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9702)|
| 2:41:44| I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9704)|
| 2:41:46| My family and I live at 8201 Greenwell Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9706)|
| 2:41:50| which is diagonally across from the property related to case file number 1B23DP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9710)|
| 2:41:56| We have lived there since 2005 and have raised our children there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9716)|
| 2:42:00| We have enjoyed the privacy, peace, and quiet of our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9720)|
| 2:42:04| and the frequent visits from various wildlife for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9724)|
| 2:42:08| If you drive down Greenwell Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9728)|
| 2:42:10| you will quickly notice that almost every home has no less than an acre of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9730)|
| 2:42:15| There is a reason for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9735)|
| 2:42:17| It is by choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9737)|
| 2:42:20| People on this road live here because we have no desire to live in cookie-cutter subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9740)|
| 2:42:26| where there is no privacy or space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9746)|
| 2:42:29| We are zoned to agriculture and enjoy not being part of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9749)|
| 2:42:33| or any of the restrictions associated with subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9753)|
| 2:42:37| Prior to 2020, I could sit in our driveway or in our backyard in the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9757)|
| 2:42:42| and watch thousands of fireflies putting on a show in the field beside our home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9762)|
| 2:42:46| that would rival the one in the Smokies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9766)|
| 2:42:49| Deer would randomly wander into our backyard and eat the apples from our trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9769)|
| 2:42:54| Sadly, those days are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9774)|
| 2:42:57| Due to a little-known Tennessee law allowing these businesses exemption from any zoning restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9777)|
| 2:43:04| two assisted living facilities were allowed to be built directly beside us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9784)|
| 2:43:08| Our peace and quiet have been replaced with their multiple vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9788)|
| 2:43:12| including frequent emergency vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9792)|
| 2:43:15| There were actually two there this morning with lights and sirens blasting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9795)|
| 2:43:20| 24-7 activity, and a large parking lot with commercial-grade lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9800)|
| 2:43:24| shining directly into our family room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9804)|
| 2:43:27| They built so close to our home that I can actually flip a rubber band and hit their window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9807)|
| 2:43:33| The promises made that they were not going to affect our community were not kept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9813)|
| 2:43:38| and we expect that this new construction will create more of the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9818)|
| 2:43:43| There have been unexpected water runoff issues created by the construction of these facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9823)|
| 2:43:48| which actually caused foundational damage to the next-door neighbor's pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9828)|
| 2:43:51| such that it is no longer usable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9831)|
| 2:43:53| The facility owner refuses to pay for the damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9833)|
| 2:43:57| On the other side of the road at 8208 Greenwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9837)|
| 2:44:00| recently completed remodeling construction has also created water runoff issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9840)|
| 2:44:05| flooding our front yard as well as the one beside us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9845)|
| 2:44:08| And if you have questions about Greenwell Road water issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9848)|
| 2:44:11| today would be a great day to drive down through there and see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9851)|
| 2:44:15| The property in this case is directly across the road from the facilities I've just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9855)|
| 2:44:21| Greenwell Road is a two-lane winding road with no sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9861)|
| 2:44:26| Both of these properties, as well as our own, are on a blind hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9866)|
| 2:44:31| We literally rebuilt our driveway when we moved in to enable a turnaround| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9871)|
| 2:44:36| to prevent us from having to back into this dangerous road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9876)|
| 2:44:40| It's had many accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9880)|
| 2:44:43| A motorcycle even wrecked into the front yard the day we were touring the house before we bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9883)|
| 2:44:48| And we see near accidents almost daily just at the Timberlake subdivision entrance alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9888)|
| 2:44:55| Additional traffic will not help this situation, especially 12 new homes on less than five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9895)|
| 2:45:03| Our additional concerns are related to the fact that these 12 homes will be rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9903)|
| 2:45:09| We own rental properties and fully understand the challenges involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9909)|
| 2:45:14| including potential crime, noise, and environmental effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9914)|
| 2:45:19| Let's face it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9919)|
| 2:45:20| There will be renters who will not be great housekeepers inside or outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9920)|
| 2:45:25| And with a minimum of 12 different renters at a time, the odds aren't good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9925)|
| 2:45:30| Also, the property values of the homes around this property were already negatively affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9930)|
| 2:45:36| by the building of the facilities next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9936)|
| 2:45:39| Twelve rental properties certainly won't do anything to increase the values of our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9939)|
| 2:45:44| We ask that the Planning Commission have in-depth conversations with the neighbors surrounding this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9944)|
| 2:45:51| and approve a plan that is better aligned with the current community and lack of infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9951)|
| 2:45:58| Please stop building just because someone identifies a way to make money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9958)|
| 2:46:02| and take into consideration the long-term effects on the surrounding community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9962)|
| 2:46:07| We are the ones who will have to deal with the repercussions of these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9967)|
| 2:46:12| I would also like to remind this commission that this particular stretch of Greenwell Road is quite infamous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9972)|
| 2:46:19| We made national news just a few years ago because of what our county mayor described as a monster sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9979)|
| 2:46:28| That's literally about four houses up the road from our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9988)|
| 2:46:33| It was a monster sinkhole, and it was quite scary to the point that I'm quite cautious of planting trees in our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=9993)|
| 2:46:40| So I'm not so sure that this particular stretch of road needs more construction in addition to all of our other concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10000)|
| 2:46:47| So I do appreciate your consideration, and thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10007)|
| 2:46:51| Thank you for your comments, Ms. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10011)|
| 2:46:54| Mr. Campbell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10014)|
| 2:46:59| So I understand the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10019)|
| 2:47:02| Robert Campbell again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10022)|
| 2:47:04| I've actually driven a John Deere tractor up and down Greenwell Road since I grew up in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10024)|
| 2:47:09| since about 1970, so I'm very familiar with the area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10029)|
| 2:47:14| And I've seen the area around my home grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10034)|
| 2:47:18| Timber Lake is backed up to us and many other developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10038)|
| 2:47:23| and the road situation is not improving in any part of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10043)|
| 2:47:31| And I would challenge anybody in this room that lives to come and find out what Pella Road is like at certain times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10051)|
| 2:47:41| when people are doing literally 80 to 90 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10061)|
| 2:47:44| So we all live with traffic issues and things that are tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10064)|
| 2:47:50| Everybody in our county does, and we understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10070)|
| 2:47:53| What we're asking for is to put 12 homes, and yes, they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10073)|
| 2:47:58| The thing is rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10078)|
| 2:48:00| However, I would challenge also anybody for home rentals to say that you're increasing the desired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10080)|
| 2:48:11| lessening the desirability for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10091)|
| 2:48:14| I don't know if you all have tried to rent a home lately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10094)|
| 2:48:19| but we're talking the same price that you pay for your PMI rates for home ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10099)|
| 2:48:26| And so we're not putting that type of renter in those homes anymore because they are so expensive to rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10106)|
| 2:48:36| And a lot of people do prefer rental over home ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10116)|
| 2:48:41| The other issues that were mentioned seem to be predominantly with the assisted living facility beside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10121)|
| 2:48:49| or whatever that facility is beside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10129)|
| 2:48:53| We're doing a standard subdivision, 12 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10133)|
| 2:48:55| It's zoned for what we're doing, and I don't know what the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10135)|
| 2:49:00| but we are putting in what is allowed per the zoning, and we are putting in single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10140)|
| 2:49:06| We're coming in at the top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10146)|
| 2:49:07| From a site distance standpoint, that should be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10147)|
| 2:49:10| Drainage will have detention ponds and other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10150)|
| 2:49:13| and I believe one of the comments mentioned some icing on the road due to ditches not being maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10153)|
| 2:49:21| Obviously, that's not under our purview as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10161)|
| 2:49:24| and we'll try to work to do whatever we can to make sure that we have a safe access to Greenville Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10164)|
| 2:49:34| and we just ask that you approve for what the staff's recommendation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10174)|
| 2:49:39| Thank you, Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10179)|
| 2:49:41| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10181)|
| 2:49:46| Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10186)|
| 2:49:48| Because of the zoning already in place and staff's recommendation for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10188)|
| 2:49:53| I would make a motion we approve the variance based on recommendations of Knox County Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10193)|
| 2:50:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10200)|
| 2:50:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10201)|
| 2:50:02| We have a motion by Vice Chair Uten to approve the variances based on recommendations of Knox County Department of Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10202)|
| 2:50:09| and Public Works, seconded by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10209)|
| 2:50:16| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10216)|
| 2:50:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10221)|
| 2:50:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10222)|
| 2:50:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10223)|
| 2:50:24| So seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10224)|
| 2:50:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10226)|
| 2:50:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10227)|
| 2:50:28| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10228)|
| 2:50:29| I'd like to make a motion we approve the concept plan subject to the following five conditions as per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10229)|
| 2:50:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10235)|
| 2:50:36| We have a motion by Vice Chair Uten, seconded by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10236)|
| 2:50:41| to approve the concept plan subject to the following five conditions as noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10241)|
| 2:50:47| This is where I'd like to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10247)|
| 2:50:48| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10248)|
| 2:50:50| I'd like to add a condition, and I talked to Jesse, staff member, prior to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10250)|
| 2:50:57| There's already a buffer requirement there on the concept plan, and I'd like to have that be undisturbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10257)|
| 2:51:06| so that instead of raising the whole property and then replanting that buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10266)|
| 2:51:11| leaving the buffer that exists there now as a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10271)|
| 2:51:17| Mr. Campbell, you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10277)|
| 2:51:19| Yeah, so let me address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10279)|
| 2:51:20| And that sounds really great and all that, but in construction, that's not always practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10280)|
| 2:51:28| And here's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10288)|
| 2:51:29| We've done developments many, many times where we've tried our best to save multiple trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10289)|
| 2:51:36| And because the root structure goes out in some cases, obviously where the canopy goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10296)|
| 2:51:41| and really the front half of this property-ish doesn't have hardly any trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10301)|
| 2:51:47| There's a few odds and ends there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10307)|
| 2:51:49| We found that what we typically have to do is about two or three years later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10309)|
| 2:51:54| those root structures have been damaged because, again, they may spread out 30, 40, 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10314)|
| 2:51:59| from where that tree is, maybe further depending on what that canopy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10319)|
| 2:52:04| And well-intentioned trying to save trees and trying to keep these buffers in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10324)|
| 2:52:10| have resulted in the homeowner having to come back in and pay somebody multiple thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10330)|
| 2:52:15| to remove a dead tree or dying tree that's near their house that creates a hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10335)|
| 2:52:23| I would rather that we go back and plant a thawed-out vegetative buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10343)|
| 2:52:29| than try to be shoehorned into trying to keep something that's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10349)|
| 2:52:33| that may create a safety issue in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10353)|
| 2:52:37| and may put an undue burden on that new homeowner or person around that home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10357)|
| 2:52:44| that, frankly, they've got enough to deal with as a homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10364)|
| 2:52:50| Again, I appreciate—and I'm not trying to be—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10370)|
| 2:52:53| I'm just trying to go from experience of what we've looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10373)|
| 2:52:56| That doesn't work like we hope it works in a lot of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10376)|
| 2:53:01| I know it's a lot easier to work with a clean slate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10381)|
| 2:53:05| and I hear what you're saying about them often not making it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10385)|
| 2:53:09| because they've been so disturbed through the construction process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10389)|
| 2:53:14| I'm not an arborist, so I can't speak to that with great authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10394)|
| 2:53:19| but I know what I would prefer to purchase is a house that had some distinct vegetation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10399)|
| 2:53:24| and when I think about some of the issues that the opponent was discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10404)|
| 2:53:29| that seems like it would help there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10409)|
| 2:53:32| So I don't know if my colleagues have any interest in supporting that as a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10412)|
| 2:53:38| So I'll open it up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10418)|
| 2:53:42| Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10422)|
| 2:53:46| I'm not seeing a required buffer in the additional comments, so where are we even—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10426)|
| 2:53:52| all I see is references to sinkholes and getting geotech letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10432)|
| 2:53:58| If you've got to go into buffers for sinkholes, help me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10438)|
| 2:54:02| It's in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10442)|
| 2:54:05| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10445)|
| 2:54:06| The 35-foot peripheral setback, I think she's referencing on the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10446)|
| 2:54:13| It's a 35-foot peripheral setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10453)|
| 2:54:15| But that's just a normal setback, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10455)|
| 2:54:16| That's a normal setback, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10456)|
| 2:54:17| There's nothing in there about buffers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10457)|
| 2:54:20| No, there's no statement about a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10460)|
| 2:54:22| I think she's asking that it be maintained as an undisturbed buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10462)|
| 2:54:27| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10467)|
| 2:54:29| This particular piece is so steep in parts of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10469)|
| 2:54:32| I don't think it makes sense from a development standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10472)|
| 2:54:38| and both of these peripheral setbacks, at least most of them that I'm looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10478)|
| 2:54:42| there's drainage, new drainage that goes down all these peripheral boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10482)|
| 2:54:49| So you have to develop these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10489)|
| 2:54:52| So I think I'm going to stick with my staff recommendation for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10492)|
| 2:55:03| Okay, so we have a motion to approve the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10503)|
| 2:55:07| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10507)|
| 2:55:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10511)|
| 2:55:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10512)|
| 2:55:13| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10513)|
| 2:55:18| Chair will entertain a third potential motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10518)|
| 2:55:21| I'd like to make a motion to approve the development plan for up to 12 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10521)|
| 2:55:25| subject to the one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10525)|
| 2:55:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10527)|
| 2:55:28| Okay, we have a motion by Vice Chair Hooten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10528)|
| 2:55:30| seconded by Commissioner Phillips to approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10530)|
| 2:55:33| for up to 12 detached residential lots subject to the one condition that is noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10533)|
| 2:55:40| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10540)|
| 2:55:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10543)|
| 2:55:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10544)|
| 2:55:45| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10545)|
| 2:55:46| Thank you, Mr. Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10546)|
| 2:55:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10548)|
| 2:55:53| All right, we're moving on to agenda item 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10553)|
| 2:55:56| Looks like we've got two more items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10556)|
| 2:56:02| Subdivision is O.T. Tindall Farm Subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10562)|
| 2:56:05| African developer, Trantonella Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10565)|
| 2:56:09| Location, south side of East Beaver Creek Drive, west of Dry Gap Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10569)|
| 2:56:14| Approximate acreage, 6.59 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10574)|
| 2:56:18| Zoning plan, residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10578)|
| 2:56:19| Existing land use, rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10579)|
| 2:56:22| Proposed use, detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10582)|
| 2:56:24| This is going to require variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10584)|
| 2:56:28| Looks like two motions, one on variances, one on concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10588)|
| 2:56:32| The first concept plan staff recommendation is to approve the requested variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10592)|
| 2:56:36| based on justification provided by the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10596)|
| 2:56:39| and recommendations of Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10599)|
| 2:56:43| And the second recommendation, approve the concept plan subject to six conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10603)|
| 2:56:49| And the applicant is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10609)|
| 2:56:51| Yes, David Harbin, 4334 Paper Mill Drive here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10611)|
| 2:56:56| This is a subdivision that we actually had approved from back in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10616)|
| 2:57:01| And actually we've got a grading permit issued by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10621)|
| 2:57:04| However, we have not started construction yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10624)|
| 2:57:07| So we're going back through the reapproval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10627)|
| 2:57:10| And essentially what we have today is the same plan that this body approved back in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10630)|
| 2:57:15| With that, we would urge your reapproval of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10635)|
| 2:57:18| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10638)|
| 2:57:19| Thank you. Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10639)|
| 2:57:22| Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10642)|
| 2:57:24| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10644)|
| 2:57:25| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10645)|
| 2:57:29| The reason that I'm rising is related to the discussion you just had about subdivision connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10649)|
| 2:57:35| This particular parcel that you're looking at, and I just put this comment in yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10655)|
| 2:57:41| and this was a late thinking when I was looking at things one more time on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10661)|
| 2:57:47| but our subdivision regulations, they have a whole section about street connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10667)|
| 2:57:52| 3.04.C, and talk about an interconnected street system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10672)|
| 2:57:56| This parcel here has opportunity to have a stub out to that large parcel to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10676)|
| 2:58:02| And as we were talking about off Summer Rose and Brookville and now Meadows at Shannon Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10682)|
| 2:58:08| the decisions that you make today may have ramifications decades down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10688)|
| 2:58:12| So this is your last opportunity to put in a stub out to actually put in potential future connectivity for a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10692)|
| 2:58:22| You have just talked through all the ramifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10702)|
| 2:58:25| So I urge you to take the time to actually implement that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10705)|
| 2:58:30| This is your final opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10710)|
| 2:58:32| And since regulations have changed, there's no appeal of development plan except to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10712)|
| 2:58:37| And so this is the final bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10717)|
| 2:58:40| So I'd urge you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10720)|
| 2:58:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10721)|
| 2:58:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10722)|
| 2:58:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10724)|
| 2:58:46| Actually, that project to the south, I've also developed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10726)|
| 2:58:49| It's under construction right now into a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10729)|
| 2:58:54| We've already graded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10734)|
| 2:58:56| There's probably about a 20-foot slope between our property and that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10736)|
| 2:58:59| So it would be very ‑‑ it's just not practical to have connectivity between those two properties now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10739)|
| 2:59:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10746)|
| 2:59:07| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10747)|
| 2:59:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10749)|
| 2:59:11| You know, in terms of connectivity, the biggest opposition we get is from existing developments that they don't want to be connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10751)|
| 2:59:21| And I think that, you know, they'll look at a development and say, well, it doesn't fit in with ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10761)|
| 2:59:25| It's totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10765)|
| 2:59:27| You know, I think it's the difference between a pedestrian accessibility issue versus a vehicular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10767)|
| 2:59:35| You know, I'm pretty comfortable with pedestrian connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10775)|
| 2:59:39| But when it comes to vehicular, we seem to get a lot of opposition in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10779)|
| 2:59:47| That's my two cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10787)|
| 2:59:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10788)|
| 2:59:49| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10789)|
| 2:59:50| I agree in terms of seeing what different developments will say or different people will say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10790)|
| 2:59:58| theirs is different than ours or we don't want that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10798)|
| 3:00:01| We've been living this way for 10 years and we don't want to change now that the next development is coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10801)|
| 3:00:06| which is just probably more resistant to change than anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10806)|
| 3:00:11| I feel like if we start putting in pedestrian access as a sort of baby step of connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10811)|
| 3:00:19| then people do start questioning, like, gosh, it would be great if we could just drive over there instead of walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10819)|
| 3:00:26| You know, maybe that's the way to start doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10826)|
| 3:00:30| If we have problems here because Mr. Harbin has said that it's already been graded or it's too steep or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10830)|
| 3:00:39| is there still the potential for a pedestrian route between the two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10839)|
| 3:00:49| I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10849)|
| 3:00:50| Not really, not now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10850)|
| 3:00:51| It's about 20 feet on a two-to-one slope, so you can't really walk up that slope right there between the two developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10851)|
| 3:01:00| Commissioner Schell, so where do you approve the concept plan on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10860)|
| 3:01:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10868)|
| 3:01:09| We did back in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10869)|
| 3:01:10| 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10870)|
| 3:01:11| Not the one that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10871)|
| 3:01:12| Oh, that's already under, yes, the concept plans have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10872)|
| 3:01:15| It's well under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10875)|
| 3:01:17| I think they're putting in utilities, as we said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10877)|
| 3:01:19| You know, even if we tried to require a stub out, that concept plan has already been approved and it wouldn't connect to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10879)|
| 3:01:25| I mean, our subdivision regulations, don't they say when we do require a stub out, there has to be a sign put at the end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10885)|
| 3:01:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10894)|
| 3:01:35| So that's part of setting people's expectations when they purchase a property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10895)|
| 3:01:41| When you don't put a sign that says it's going to potentially connect, people are going to be mad when you try and connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10901)|
| 3:01:48| So, you know, that's what we have to do going forward to set people's expectations when they purchase a property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10908)|
| 3:01:56| is that they know this isn't going to be their little dead-end street forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10916)|
| 3:02:01| I mean, personally, I think the way we've built out so much of the county is crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10921)|
| 3:02:04| I mean, you go visit so many other places in this country and they connect eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10924)|
| 3:02:13| So it's a matter of expectations, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10933)|
| 3:02:17| I think that's why people, we've been doing it this way for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10937)|
| 3:02:20| It's what people expect and they get upset when you do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10940)|
| 3:02:25| I think one of the issues is our topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10945)|
| 3:02:28| You know, we're not out west where it's flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10948)|
| 3:02:31| Topography plays so much into how we develop property and how we connect into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10951)|
| 3:02:36| and it becomes a very difficult challenge to try to tie in developments that occur at different phases during the life of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10956)|
| 3:02:45| So, I mean, it sounds good, but in practice around here it becomes more of a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10965)|
| 3:02:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10972)|
| 3:02:53| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10973)|
| 3:02:55| So based on, you know, what Mr. Harbin has said, vehicular traffic is not possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10975)|
| 3:03:01| pedestrian traffic is not possible, so unless he's going to put in a BMX park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10981)|
| 3:03:05| I'm going to go ahead and make that we approve the requested variance based on the justification provided by the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10985)|
| 3:03:11| and recommendations of the Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10991)|
| 3:03:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10995)|
| 3:03:18| All right, we have a motion to approve the requested variances by Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=10998)|
| 3:03:24| seconded by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11004)|
| 3:03:27| Signal lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11007)|
| 3:03:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11009)|
| 3:03:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11010)|
| 3:03:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11011)|
| 3:03:32| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11012)|
| 3:03:33| I'll make a motion to approve the concept plan subject to the six conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11013)|
| 3:03:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11018)|
| 3:03:39| We've got a motion to approve the concept plan subject to the six conditions by Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11019)|
| 3:03:43| seconded by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11023)|
| 3:03:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11025)|
| 3:03:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11026)|
| 3:03:47| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11027)|
| 3:03:48| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11028)|
| 3:03:49| And we've got one other motion that I almost overlooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11029)|
| 3:03:52| I will approve the development plan for up to 30 detached dwellings on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11032)|
| 3:03:56| and the reduction of the peripheral setback from 35 feet to 25 feet subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11036)|
| 3:04:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11042)|
| 3:04:04| All right, we have a motion to approve the development plan for up to 30 detached dwelling units on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11044)|
| 3:04:10| and the reduction of the peripheral setback from 35 to 25 feet subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11050)|
| 3:04:16| Motion made by Commissioner Smith, seconded by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11056)|
| 3:04:20| Signal lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11060)|
| 3:04:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11061)|
| 3:04:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11062)|
| 3:04:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11063)|
| 3:04:24| And the motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11064)|
| 3:04:25| Moving on to the final agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11065)|
| 3:04:34| Item number 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11074)|
| 3:04:37| And this is a request to review and make a recommendation on amendments to the Knox County zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11077)|
| 3:04:47| I think what I'll do is read the recommended motion into the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11087)|
| 3:04:54| and then if Ms. Portier would like to elaborate, I'd be glad for her to contribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11094)|
| 3:05:01| So the recommendation or motion, staff recommends that the Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11101)|
| 3:05:07| recommend approval of amendments to the Knox County zoning code article 5, section 5.31.03| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11107)|
| 3:05:16| pertaining to the CA general business zone to allow for consideration of the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11116)|
| 3:05:22| Uses permitted by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11122)|
| 3:05:25| Drive-thru facilities located on arterial streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11125)|
| 3:05:30| Clinics, medical offices, dental offices and other medical uses of a similar nature in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11130)|
| 3:05:38| And then we would have uses permitted on review, which would be drive-thru facilities on collector streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11138)|
| 3:05:46| multi-dwelling structures or developments, attached houses, upper level dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11146)|
| 3:05:53| Then article 5 of section 5.32.03 pertaining to the CB business and manufacturing zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11153)|
| 3:06:01| to allow for consideration of the following uses to be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11161)|
| 3:06:06| Drive-thru facilities located on arterial and collector streets as a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11166)|
| 3:06:12| Clinics, medical offices, dental offices and other medical uses of a similar nature in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11172)|
| 3:06:18| And then uses permitted on review would be multi-dwelling structures or developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11178)|
| 3:06:25| attached houses, upper level dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11185)|
| 3:06:29| An amendment to the Knox County zoning code article 4 adding a new subsection 4.108| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11189)|
| 3:06:36| creating standards for drive-thru facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11196)|
| 3:06:40| Amendments to the Knox County zoning code article 5, sections 5.37.03.C and 5.38.03E| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11200)|
| 3:06:52| and 5.91.03 pertaining to drive-thru facilities currently permitted as a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11212)|
| 3:06:59| in the CR regional commercial, CN neighborhood commercial and TC town center zones respectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11219)|
| 3:07:07| Adding a reference to proposed subsection 4.108 pertaining to standards for drive-thru facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11227)|
| 3:07:14| No change is proposed to the allowance of drive-thru facilities in these zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11234)|
| 3:07:19| So we've got that behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11239)|
| 3:07:21| Ms. Porche, would you like to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11241)|
| 3:07:27| We kind of elaborated this in good detail in the agenda review meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11247)|
| 3:07:31| so I guess I'll just answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11251)|
| 3:07:33| I know we've got someone signed up to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11253)|
| 3:07:35| so I'm happy to respond to any questions and comments that they might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11255)|
| 3:07:38| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11258)|
| 3:07:39| Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11259)|
| 3:07:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11263)|
| 3:07:44| I hope everybody knows where I live by now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11264)|
| 3:07:47| First of all, I want to extend a big thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11267)|
| 3:07:52| I know this recommendation has come from the Alcoa Highway Corridor Study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11272)|
| 3:07:56| and a lot of times we see studies where recommendations are made and then nothing happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11276)|
| 3:08:02| I just want to say that we're encouraged to see some actual implementation come from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11282)|
| 3:08:07| I also want to extend a big thanks to Michelle and the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11287)|
| 3:08:10| They have done a really great job looking at this from a lot of different angles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11290)|
| 3:08:15| and researching and come up with some really great standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11295)|
| 3:08:20| I have a few comments, but I want to start and say this is a very positive step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11300)|
| 3:08:27| I want to thank the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11307)|
| 3:08:29| They've researched it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11309)|
| 3:08:30| They've taken the time and come up with some stuff that I never was like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11310)|
| 3:08:35| wow, that's really great around signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11315)|
| 3:08:38| So a big kudos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11318)|
| 3:08:40| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11320)|
| 3:08:43| A couple things I'll call out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11323)|
| 3:08:46| I sent this in in some fairly lengthy comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11326)|
| 3:08:49| But, you know, staff is trying to do a good job balancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11329)|
| 3:08:54| especially on the drive-through uses, where those occur and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11334)|
| 3:08:59| And I want to point out that a root cause of that is that we have a lot of property in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11339)|
| 3:09:03| especially the rural area, that's legacy zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11343)|
| 3:09:06| It's been zoned for, you know, 20, 40, 50, 60 years as CA or CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11346)|
| 3:09:11| And that property, you know, CA and CB allow a lot of uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11351)|
| 3:09:15| but generally it's next to somebody's house or a vacant field or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11355)|
| 3:09:19| And the root cause of why we're dancing around with some of the drive-through uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11359)|
| 3:09:24| and, you know, are they all okay on arterials and use of I-Ride or use on reviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11364)|
| 3:09:28| because we've got that property zone CA and CB out, you know, just isolated pockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11368)|
| 3:09:33| We could actually address the root problem by doing an administrative rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11373)|
| 3:09:37| and looking at taking some of that and rezoning it to more appropriate CN| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11377)|
| 3:09:42| or rural commercial-type zones, which have more protections and better uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11382)|
| 3:09:48| And then, you know, you're not trying to craft the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11388)|
| 3:09:51| around this exception to the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11391)|
| 3:09:53| But given that we are, we had a couple of ideas and thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11393)|
| 3:09:58| First, on the drive-through uses in the CA zone in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11398)|
| 3:10:03| there are a lot of minor arterials in the county spread all over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11403)|
| 3:10:08| and a lot of CA property on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11408)|
| 3:10:10| And when we started looking at some of those locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11410)|
| 3:10:13| there's a lot of places where you have a CA zone property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11413)|
| 3:10:16| that could have a drive-through put on it on-right on a minor arterial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11416)|
| 3:10:19| right next to several houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11419)|
| 3:10:22| And those people, you know, that extends out in some really rural areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11422)|
| 3:10:26| and that's probably not what those neighbors would be expecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11426)|
| 3:10:29| So this zoning ordinance is going to give a new right to those CA properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11429)|
| 3:10:35| We think it might be an improvement to say that it's major arterials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11435)|
| 3:10:41| where CA gets a drive-through by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11441)|
| 3:10:43| That would be things like Chapman Highway and Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11443)|
| 3:10:46| and the more major arterials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11446)|
| 3:10:49| But it would take it away from some of the minor arterials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11449)|
| 3:10:54| like I believe Harris Road, which is out near me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11454)|
| 3:10:58| which is 17 or 18 feet wide in a few places, is a minor arterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11458)|
| 3:11:03| And I don't think that would be a great place for CA zone to have a drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11463)|
| 3:11:09| So that's one particular suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11469)|
| 3:11:12| You might also consider if, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11472)|
| 3:11:14| we should even be doing use and review for drive-throughs on minor collectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11474)|
| 3:11:18| if you look at the size of what those streets are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11478)|
| 3:11:20| That's a question, but I'd put that in the red line comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11480)|
| 3:11:27| Similar in the CB zone, I think we were thinking that both levels of arterial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11487)|
| 3:11:32| major and minor, that kind of made sense when we looked at the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11492)|
| 3:11:35| and where CB zone property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11495)|
| 3:11:38| A use by right on an arterial in CB, you know, that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11498)|
| 3:11:42| There are a few places I found a location on Babley Road that is zoned CB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11502)|
| 3:11:47| but it's a collector and it's surrounded by houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11507)|
| 3:11:50| and I'm not sure that a use by right for a drive-through there is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11510)|
| 3:11:54| that would be exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11514)|
| 3:11:57| So that deals a little bit with, you know, the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11517)|
| 3:12:02| We had a suggestion, too, you know, a question to think about is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11522)|
| 3:12:06| where is a drive-through use appropriate that's next to residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11526)|
| 3:12:10| And Michelle gave me a couple of really good examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11530)|
| 3:12:14| You might have, like, a bank teller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11534)|
| 3:12:16| A bank operates, you know, 8 to 6 or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11536)|
| 3:12:19| and a drive-through for a bank, that's probably, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11539)|
| 3:12:21| kind of a low-impact one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11541)|
| 3:12:23| But if you have a restaurant, like a Taco Bell or Crystal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11543)|
| 3:12:25| it's open until midnight or 2 a.m., that's not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11545)|
| 3:12:28| that's going to create a lot more adverse impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11548)|
| 3:12:32| So maybe, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11552)|
| 3:12:34| if you can add conditions on modifying permitted hours of operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11554)|
| 3:12:38| you know, that would be something to put in your toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11558)|
| 3:12:41| That's a lot of it in summary, and I'm out of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11561)|
| 3:12:47| so I'll let you take on the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11567)|
| 3:12:48| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11568)|
| 3:12:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11569)|
| 3:12:51| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11571)|
| 3:12:53| And this is more just for our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11573)|
| 3:12:56| Again, I don't know how you all go about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11576)|
| 3:12:58| just something I've encountered over the last couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11578)|
| 3:13:01| Under Z, which, you know, where clinics, medical offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11581)|
| 3:13:05| dental offices, and other medical uses of similar nature and size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11585)|
| 3:13:08| with things that are going on in our country, in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11588)|
| 3:13:13| with the rise of mental health services that are needing to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11593)|
| 3:13:18| the state, everybody has little check boxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11598)|
| 3:13:22| and they don't, the State Department of Mental Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11602)|
| 3:13:25| doesn't necessarily view those as medical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11605)|
| 3:13:28| the way it's kind of described in all of our definitions and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11608)|
| 3:13:32| so we really need to look at how we do classified outpatient mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11612)|
| 3:13:36| so that, because, I mean, I've had to contact Jim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11616)|
| 3:13:39| I had to contact the city just to get letters from various agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11619)|
| 3:13:44| within planning and stuff just for outpatient mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11624)|
| 3:13:48| where there's no prescriptions being, because the state says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11628)|
| 3:13:51| well, that's not clear in our definitions of what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11631)|
| 3:13:55| that falls under medical and all of that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11635)|
| 3:13:57| So just some things to look at, because I know as more money is coming down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11637)|
| 3:14:01| there's just a lot of mental health growth that's going to take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11641)|
| 3:14:05| and that's something that we probably ought to be aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11645)|
| 3:14:08| and just ahead of the curve so that, you know, we know what's going on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11648)|
| 3:14:12| and just to cut down some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11652)|
| 3:14:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11655)|
| 3:14:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11659)|
| 3:14:22| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11662)|
| 3:14:23| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11663)|
| 3:14:25| I just can't get enough of you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11665)|
| 3:14:29| I thought many of Kevin Murphy's comments that were posted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11669)|
| 3:14:35| the one that stood out to me the most I thought were about the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11675)|
| 3:14:40| all of the excellent parameters that had been defined by the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11680)|
| 3:14:44| for ways to mitigate light pollution, sound pollution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11684)|
| 3:14:49| those sorts of things from the drive-through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11689)|
| 3:14:52| can't control the vehicles themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11692)|
| 3:14:55| And I think that helped me probably best figure out why I have such an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11695)|
| 3:15:01| with drive-throughs, because even though you can put in vegetative buffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11701)|
| 3:15:08| and have lights that aim down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11708)|
| 3:15:10| you still can't control the cars that are going through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11710)|
| 3:15:13| the hours they're going through there, and the mufflers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11713)|
| 3:15:16| and their lights and their radios and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11716)|
| 3:15:19| So it really has a big impact on the residential area right around a drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11719)|
| 3:15:25| And I think those are very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11725)|
| 3:15:27| I'm thinking very specifically of, like, a fast-food drive-through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11727)|
| 3:15:30| as opposed to a bank or something else that has more regularized hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11730)|
| 3:15:38| So I wish that this amendment or the edits included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11738)|
| 3:15:44| that all of the drive-throughs were used on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11744)|
| 3:15:47| just because they make such a big impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11747)|
| 3:15:51| regardless of the roads that they're on, just being able to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11751)|
| 3:15:54| especially when there's outdated zoning that may allow them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11754)|
| 3:15:57| just to be able to say, oh, this is really a bad place for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11757)|
| 3:16:01| I wish that that was something that we could do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11761)|
| 3:16:04| But those are just the two points that I wanted to raise up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11764)|
| 3:16:07| if anyone had not seen those vehicle comments about the drive-through impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11767)|
| 3:16:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11775)|
| 3:16:16| Mr. Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11776)|
| 3:16:18| I guess I wanted to speak to the multifamily building side of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11778)|
| 3:16:23| which I think is a wonderful addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11783)|
| 3:16:27| I mean, if you read the zones, it does jump directly from single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11787)|
| 3:16:30| and duplexes all the way to hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11790)|
| 3:16:33| There's nothing in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11793)|
| 3:16:34| And we've had a lot of conversations about the missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11794)|
| 3:16:37| and zonings and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11797)|
| 3:16:39| where I think this is a really positive step in the right direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11799)|
| 3:16:43| to allow more housing and be more flexible with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11803)|
| 3:16:47| It's allowed by right under OB and RB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11807)|
| 3:16:51| where we still have an extra catch with the use on review to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11811)|
| 3:16:56| just as Mr. Murphy said, sometimes these things are located too far out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11816)|
| 3:17:00| but it gives this body an opportunity to review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11820)|
| 3:17:03| So I think it's all very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11823)|
| 3:17:06| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11826)|
| 3:17:09| Chair, we'll entertain a motion if you'll recite the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11829)|
| 3:17:14| I make a motion that what you said is what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11834)|
| 3:17:18| First staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11838)|
| 3:17:22| I could slow walk this about four more minutes since I predicted the over 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11842)|
| 3:17:27| but I think you guys would be after me, so I won't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11847)|
| 3:17:29| So we've got a motion, first staff recommendation by Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11849)|
| 3:17:34| seconded by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11854)|
| 3:17:37| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11857)|
| 3:17:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11859)|
| 3:17:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11860)|
| 3:17:41| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11861)|
| 3:17:42| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230112?start=11862)|
