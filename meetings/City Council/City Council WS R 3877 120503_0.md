| 0:06:19| proposal that Mayor Rojero and her staff have worked on so diligently deserves to be passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=379)|
| 0:06:26| and go on the ballot so that Knoxville taxpayers can make a uniform decision and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=386)|

| 0:12:14| I'm going to tell you how to do your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| I appreciate this mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| She's thinking outside the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| Our guys know that you've got to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| I'm not even sure about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| I don't know how you're rolling along and all of a sudden you're scared to death you're going to owe 30 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| and somebody's going to have to convince me of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| But, you know, the market went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| The market will go back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| The problem is with the 401ks is why I don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| I've got a different plan than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| It's pretty sweet unless you're 65 and it's like it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| And that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| So I think what Mayor O'Hara done, Vice Mayor, is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| You all ought to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| And quit looking at all dollars and cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| There's human cost involved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| And what's it worth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| I'm going to leave one store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| It's going to take me 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| I used to be a greedy man, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| When I first started this business, I was going to make me 20 million and be one of the big guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=793)|
| 0:13:20| And when you start a business, it's from ding to dark 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| And I told my wife I went home complaining one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| And she's a fine lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| She's an angel, 49 years with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| But I said, All I do is hire people and when am I going to make some money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| And she said, That's enough to make you a rich man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| And that's what companies do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| They hire people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| And I've thought about that a lot, and it changed my whole philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| So what I'm asking you all to do is go deep thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| It's going to cost money either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| Find out what they prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| They're the ones that are going to draw these pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| Everybody else works somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| I mean, you either got your pension or you're making your own like I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| But hear what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| And I have nothing in this except these are fellow people that work good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| I respect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| Without the professionalism of that firefighter, we wouldn't be sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| That whole gay street was gone if the wind had been going the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| And what they do is magnificent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| Police Department, they're good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| They've come a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| I think it costs about, somebody tell me, $100,000 to train one of these guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| I don't want to lose people like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| So find a way to keep them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| Find a way to keep them happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| They've already done more compromising than I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=891)|
| 0:15:02| Avis Reed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=902)|
| 0:15:18| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| My name is Avis Evans Reed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| I reside at 1604 Bickerstaff Boulevard in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=922)|
| 0:15:29| I am the Executive Director of the Police Advisory and Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| PARC is the liaison between the citizens of Knoxville and the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=935)|
| 0:15:45| Our purpose is to strengthen the relationship between the citizens of Knoxville and KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=945)|
| 0:15:55| I am here tonight to ask that you pass the mayor's hybrid proposal to be placed on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=955)|
| 0:16:03| so the citizens can decide on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| The KPD and the KPD training agency have been declared a flagship agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=968)|
| 0:16:17| by the Commission on Accreditation of Law Enforcement Agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=977)|
| 0:16:24| This accreditation did not come lightly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| and it is very important that Knoxville has such accreditation for recruiting qualified citizens to the KPD force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=988)|
| 0:16:42| In trying to bridge relationships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| I believe it is imperative that we maintain highly trained, experienced officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1006)|
| 0:16:56| and we continue to have the best employees providing the best services possible for the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1016)|
| 0:17:08| Now, I don't mean to say that KPD is perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| There's always room for improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| But KPD's force is a professional agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| and PARC is working on a daily basis with KPD to ensure quality officers are retained in order to serve our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1041)|
| 0:17:34| If we eliminate a pension plan, we run the risk of losing good officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1054)|
| 0:17:43| which will ultimately harm the relationship between the citizens and the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1063)|
| 0:17:51| A high turnover rate is extremely costly to the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| You don't want to solve one problem by creating another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| We don't want to create a situation where KPD trains officers for surrounding police agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1083)|
| 0:18:12| A good, defined benefit plan helps retain good officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1092)|
| 0:18:19| Another area of concern for PARC is maintaining a culturally diverse police force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1099)|
| 0:18:26| which reflects the community they are sworn to serve and protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1106)|
| 0:18:32| As of January of this year, KPD has 419 uniformed officers, 42 are female, and 34 are minority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1112)|
| 0:18:44| KPD needs to be able to compete with other agencies in order to improve these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1124)|
| 0:18:52| I believe that it's important that the plan the mayor and employee groups have agreed to is a reasonable solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1132)|
| 0:19:01| and I would like for the citizens to show their support at the polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| Thank you this afternoon for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| Please support the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1151)|
| 0:19:18| Councilwoman Pilo, are you going to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1158)|
| 0:19:30| You're probably familiar, but if you'll give your name and address, then you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| Barbara Pilo, 8437 Cortland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| And I'm not accustomed to standing in this position, but I really wanted to speak to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1180)|
| 0:19:48| And I want all of you to be aware I no longer have any representation on the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1188)|
| 0:19:56| or any personal relationship, haven't talked to a pension board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| but had the good fortune of attending the mayor's budget lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1202)|
| 0:20:09| and heard the proposal that the mayor put before us all for her budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1209)|
| 0:20:17| and have given a great deal of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| I guess you noticed that I've been sitting in on these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| This is not a new concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| This is not a new subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| This is not something new to those of us who have been concerned about the pension plan for many months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1230)|
| 0:20:39| and really actually for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| I want to particularly express support for all of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| You know, it didn't take long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| Maybe I had the good fortune to work with many of these folks that wanted to come see you tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1254)|
| 0:21:03| for several years before I was ever in the position that you hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| And I began to appreciate incredible dedication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| I began to watch the lights in the windows long after the hours they're paid to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1273)|
| 0:21:21| I just had some wonderful experiences with people in our neighborhoods, in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| And this is from all walks of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| You know the cold days when somebody comes out in the rain and picks up your garbage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1291)|
| 0:21:37| Those folks, we don't know them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| They are tremendously dedicated to us as taxpayers, as citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1299)|
| 0:21:46| They're dedicated to the face of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| And I just want you to think about them and how much they mean to you, to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1309)|
| 0:21:57| It is not the highest paid job in Knoxville by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| This is not private business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| This is not, I always thought when I was sitting in your seat, wanted to run Knoxville like a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1328)|
| 0:22:16| And I believe in good business principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| Try to help my husband run his business in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| But at the same time, we have to remember this is public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| And it takes a particular kind of individual to commit themselves to public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1352)|
| 0:22:39| One interesting thing I've learned, and I'm sure you have too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| that sometimes we are talking about generations who have committed themselves to this kind of public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1363)|
| 0:22:51| Now, having this concern about our pension plan, its stability, its sustainability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1371)|
| 0:23:00| before me and others for quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| I've been very concerned about how we're going to approach it, how we're going to deal with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| how the taxpayers can come to peace with where we are and where we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| We have extremely good advisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| You have a very dedicated pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| I have never experienced in the, I think, seven years I served on the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1404)|
| 0:23:31| I have never experienced an employee who was only thinking of his comrades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1411)|
| 0:23:40| If he was a policeman or a fireman or if he worked in the public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1420)|
| 0:23:46| I have never seen that kind of priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| I have always seen them to be very concerned about the plan and the fund as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1430)|
| 0:23:57| And I just wanted to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| So in listening to the mayor last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1440)|
| 0:24:07| I surprised myself a bit when I began to feel that under the circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1447)|
| 0:24:18| given where we are, given what we must do at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1458)|
| 0:24:25| this hybrid plan is really what I hope you will find yourself supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1465)|
| 0:24:34| I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| I think that it fully extends the appreciation to our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| It extends to you and to all of us citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| to continue to have excellent employee retention and recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1487)|
| 0:24:56| I was here at a time initially when recruitment and retention was a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1496)|
| 0:25:06| It wasn't that long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| I know the concern about the cost of seeing our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| in whom we have a huge investment, need to leave Knoxville because they couldn't afford to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1515)|
| 0:25:26| We don't want to be in the education business, in the training business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| We want to be in the business of taking care of our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| so that they will feel a lifelong dedication to the position that they found here in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1535)|
| 0:25:42| I really understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| I understand that you all are in a very difficult position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| It's tough being mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| Satin stewed over it, finally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| Many discussions and comments over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| But you have incredibly good advisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| I think you have an administration that has looked me squarely in the eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| And I feel that they have come to the solution they feel the citizens can appreciate, can support, and can vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1573)|
| 0:26:28| And I really hope that you can support all these folks here who support us so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1588)|
| 0:26:35| Thank you for letting me speak to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1595)|
| 0:26:45| That concludes the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| And we'll go back to the welcome, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| I know you had a prior engagement in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| I'm glad you could join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| And I'll turn it over to Bill Lyons for a brief presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1619)|
| 0:27:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| And I promise to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| You've got a lot of discussing to do among yourselves with what we presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| I know you'll have some new information tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| Mayor O'Hara would love to have been here, but she's had a longstanding commitment she just couldn't avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| So I express her regrets on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| What I've done is passed out another version, and this won't show on the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| but you all have in front of you, of the hybrid plan we presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| And this is done after, A, talking with many of you and sensing your concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| and, B, following the discussion up here and reading the very clear message from council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| which is you don't want to be in a position, put future councils in a position you're facing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| which is with the big bill coming due that the assumptions that led,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| that had assumptions that underwritten it that predicted that we would not have this bill coming due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| You don't want any surprises like this to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| And as we prepared this hybrid, as we altered this hybrid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| we have been very sensitive to the fact that this council and this administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| and we think the public and I think it's the employees as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| realized we have got to attenuate the risk the future taxpayers face in this pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| I think that has been a driving force going into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| So in doing so, we also sensed in the last couple of weeks a real sensitivity to any automatic escalators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1698)|
| 0:28:25| That was very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| And when we said this hybrid plan set the amount of everything that's defined benefit up to $40,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1707)|
| 0:28:34| defined contribution over $40,000, and had an inflator in there, that caused a lot of very understandable unrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| It was there to account for future inflation, but understandably this caused some anxiety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| So after, again, talking with some of you and thinking about this and speaking with the mayor, we decided to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| and speaking with Mr. Gilbert and Mr. Swanson, we decided to pursue another solution to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| which is don't put any escalator, put it at $40,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| and write what goes before the taxpayers in such a way as to allow future councils to adjust this, if they wish, by ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1740)|
| 0:29:09| or if they wish not to, by ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| In other words, nothing is automatic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| So that has changed the chemistry of this plan that we're presenting a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| So I want to talk briefly about risk here, because that's what this is about, and I'm going to be very brief on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1758)|
| 0:29:26| This is about balancing risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| The plan we've put in front of you, in the constellation of plans that cities are considering, is about, makes drastic cutbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1769)|
| 0:29:38| We don't know, and there may be some, I am unaware of any comparable city to Knoxville that has a pure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| defined compensation plan for its employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| So risk is being out the first there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| Risk is not knowing what the impact would be on the human resources end of this business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| and I'm going to talk this as a business a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| Risk is not knowing what would happen when somebody, when a new class of employee comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| who has got a vastly different payment plan than those that preceded him or her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1802)|
| 0:30:09| So we want to keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| That's risk that we're balancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| We've got some real unknown in going to a pure, defined compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| How have we addressed that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| One, by freezing this 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| Two, by putting the COLA to be capped at 3%, where now it's got a floor of 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| And that is incredibly important and attenuates a lot of the potential exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| Third, and I think we haven't had a chance to talk about this, and I hope we all get to later throughout the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| a 10-year vesting period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| Now, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| That means an employee who's hired January of 2013 under a new system will not be vested until 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1840)|
| 0:30:50| That is a long time before the legal accompaniments of vesting take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| That's a number of election cycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| We can pursue what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| That 10-year vesting, we think, is very important in attenuating the risk of something happening later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| and going, we're stuck with this plan for these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| You've got 10 years where that could be adjusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| Now, what I'd like to do briefly is go to one other thing and then get out of your way, and that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| I handed you all out a couple of graphs, and I'd like to move to the second one since that's relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1876)|
| 0:31:23| That is the expectation, if you could get to the second one, Alan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1883)|
| 0:31:30| Is that what's up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Okay, you can't see the blue too well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| The flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| Yeah, if you all can't tell in the audience, there's a very light blue line that he's pointing to right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| What this gets at is the expected cost of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| We've removed, this is just the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| The present obligations are now out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| They're constant regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| We know how concerned we are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| We're all concerned with the obligations that we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| This will start in 2013, this new plan, as people sign up, and gradually the costs will increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| and this graph goes out to 2040.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| The most expensive, assuming, well, let's not assume anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| The top line, the blue line, is the expenses associated with the defined contribution plan that we have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1932)|
| 0:32:19| It is the most expensive to the taxpayers, making the assumptions we had, unless, and this is the key,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1939)|
| 0:32:26| unless the market performs really badly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| I don't mean just a little badly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| I mean really badly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| The red line, if you could point to that, is what we would expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| If it only performs at 5 percent, and that's under any historic record through all the downturns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| at only 5 percent, which is, of course, short of the 6.5 percent we based the original projections on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| this is going to cost the taxpayers less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| Now, eventually, you'll get to a point where there's some exposure here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| I mean, if it gets to 3, if it gets to 2, you're going to start going a little higher eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| But unless we're in a very unusual situation, the most expensive obligation to the taxpayers is on the defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1983)|
| 0:33:11| Now, as we all know, that's known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| That's the advantage, talking both sides of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| That is a known pay-as-you-go commitment that we can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| The other does involve assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| And I know I heard last time from many of you, we're real uncomfortable with assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| What we've got now is based on assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| These are much more modest assumptions, A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| And B, I want to stress this, the obligations have been greatly scaled back to what we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2012)|
| 0:33:39| No rule of 80, no drop, higher retirement age, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| So I will just emphasize that we're talking about much attenuated market risk to balance against the risk of getting into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2023)|
| 0:33:51| unknown territory and how we reimburse our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| And we think that is the risk that has to be balanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| That's a business decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| It's always balancing risk and reward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| And that's no different from that and taking it as a business proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| The final thing I'd like to say and say on behalf of Mayor O'Hara is all of this needs to be, we think, and should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2045)|
| 0:34:15| about finding the point of common interest among all the competing variables and avoiding positional thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2055)|
| 0:34:22| Positional thinking is putting a flag with defined contribution on one end to define benefit of the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| This, by definition, is away from those positions and away from hardcore philosophies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| The common interest is this, reducing the taxpayer's exposure to the pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| getting a reasonable amount of compensation for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| And our employee compensation should include a retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2080)|
| 0:34:46| This retirement plan is reasonable by all measures that one can take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| Admittedly, it is probably richer and has more guarantee than that that you see in your private business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2091)|
| 0:34:57| There's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| And that's where you balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| We're talking about public employment versus private employment, and there is a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| And we invest in training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| You've heard, I'm not going to repeat all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| You all have heard that enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| But there is, that's what we're predicating this on, the difference that mandates our investment in training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| the type of employee, the jobs they have, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| We think getting to the point of common interest is clearly in this hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| which is in the constellation, again, of reforms, pretty, is pretty extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2124)|
| 0:35:32| It is, it would put, that puts us out in where Wall Street Journal editorializes about Rhode Island| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2132)|
| 0:35:39| and the great risk their governor took and took on, quote, took on the public employee unions to get a hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| That was praised on the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal, getting to a hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| We're talking about risking some very uncertain territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| Finally, I'd like to say we have an opportunity to have the community faced with a very clear choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| The legislative branch, the executive branch, employee groups, together, saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| we think this addresses our future pension obligations in a way that's reasonable, responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2165)|
| 0:36:13| respects the taxpayer, reduces the risk, and, yes, does not expose us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| unless we have incredibly draconian outcomes, to the kind of exposure that we have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2177)|
| 0:36:24| And I think it would be great if the employees and the mayor feels it would be great if the voters later could see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2184)|
| 0:36:31| and have that kind of message, vote yes on this, we're all together on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| It would be a shame to have this become sufficiently divisive where you're entering in, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2196)|
| 0:36:42| what about the nature of public employment, and all the issues we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| and have a muddled message and an unclear and divisive message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| Now, this is democracy. Sometimes you have divisive messages. That's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| We have to live with that. We're not always going to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| But I will close by saying this plan, with the ten-year vesting, we think is very big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| We think flattening the $40,000 and leaving that to later councils, if they choose to, is very big and limiting exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2219)|
| 0:37:07| And we think that, for the most part, in most circumstances, this costs the taxpayer less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| That's gotten lost in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| This is a pension plan that is reasonable in terms of cost and risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2236)|
| 0:37:23| And I'm talking about this as a business proposition that you all face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| because you're responsible for making very large financial decisions on behalf of the future of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| and councils and mayors and citizens and workers who will be here later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| So I will stop with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| Alan is here, and he can answer questions about these numbers when we get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| I know you have other folks who are here to make a presentation that's been requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| so I will leave it up to you folks at your workshop as to what you would like us to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2270)|
| 0:37:58| Thank you, Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| I will call on Joe Thompson and Morgan Keegan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| Thank you for having us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| We were asked to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| Again, my name is Joe Thompson, 6824 Lionheart Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| We were asked by the council and the workgroup to come and give an update on the deferred compensation plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| the defined contribution plan that the city already has in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| Let me first say that whatever the city decides to do, we're 100 percent for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2303)|
| 0:38:31| We don't have a dog in the fight, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| We're simply here tonight just to give you an update on what the city provides its employees in the way of the deferred compensation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2314)|
| 0:38:43| So I do have a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| I think that they're getting it queued up, and I do have some handouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| The first thing I'd say is that the city's plan, what we know as the deferred compensation plan, is a 457B plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2329)|
| 0:38:59| Currently, there are 1,279 participants in the plan, so it is broadly used throughout the city employment ranks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2339)|
| 0:39:10| There are 1,234 participants that are currently deferring money into the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2350)|
| 0:39:18| so roughly you have, let's call it 50 retirees that still are in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2358)|
| 0:39:24| The plan currently has just over $29 million in total assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2364)|
| 0:39:32| On a comparable basis, that rates Knoxville very, very well with cities of similar size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2372)|
| 0:39:41| All the costs associated with the plan are borne by the participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| There is not a cost that the city or the taxpayers bear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| It's 100 percent borne by the participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| Currently, the city matches $10 on every participant's paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2394)|
| 0:40:03| They match $10 on the first $20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| Most participants, as long as they're putting in $20 a paycheck, are getting a $10 match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2407)|
| 0:40:14| There are 16 investment options in the plan, representing 14 asset classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2414)|
| 0:40:21| I do have a handout at the end that has a list of the investment options categorized by asset classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2421)|
| 0:40:28| It is a broad diversification of funds that the participants can choose from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| There is one guaranteed income fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| They do have managed portfolios that, as a participant, the way to think of the Goalmaker portfolios is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2436)|
| 0:40:44| as a participant gets older, they take less risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| In other words, a 65-year-old who is in the Goalmaker program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| And I would say that there's no additional costs associated with the Goalmaker program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| As they get older, there is substantially less risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| As they get closer to retirement, they don't have 100 percent of their money invested in equities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| and run the risk of losing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| That has been a very popular option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| We are actively considering adding additional investment options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| One of those investment options is a guaranteed income option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| which will allow the participant to fund essentially a guaranteed stream of income down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| Those are very popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| In no way is it meant to be a substitute for the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2488)|
| 0:41:35| It's just a tool that is available and that can enhance the retirement income of participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2495)|
| 0:41:43| The investment options are 100 percent participant directed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| There are plenty of the participants that have 100 percent of their money in the guaranteed fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| and there are plenty of other participants who have their money in the Goalmaker portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| It is 100 percent participant directed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| Of course, Jessica and Prudential, we provide assistance where we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| But that is a significant difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| If you look at the next slide, you'll see just kind of a breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| Who are the parties involved in the deferred compensation plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| First and foremost at the top are the participants of the deferred compensation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2534)|
| 0:42:20| Everybody works for the participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| The city has a deferred compensation committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| We'll talk more about that committee in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| But the committee oversees all aspects of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| Morgan Keegan, we are plan consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| We'll talk about what we do in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| And Prudential, of course, is the administrator of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| If you look at the next slide, and I'm trying to speed it up to save time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2564)|
| 0:42:50| the deferred compensation committee is made up of seven employees from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2570)|
| 0:42:58| There is one representative from the risk management office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| there's one representative from the law office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| and there's one representative from the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| Four members serve staggered terms and are appointed by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2589)|
| 0:43:16| Two of those are uniformed officers, one from the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| and one from the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| And two are non-uniformed employees, again, appointed by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| I can assure you that there's broad representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| There's every intention of having broad representation from the various groups within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2611)|
| 0:43:39| The current members are Mike Cherry, Lisa Hatfield, Gary Eastis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| of course from risk management is our venerable chairman over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| Gary Price from the police department, Scott Calloway, Brian Lynch, and Steve King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| Again, appointed by the mayor or representatives from strategic departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2637)|
| 0:44:04| If you'll turn the slide, Morgan Keegan, what are our roles and responsibilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| Let me first say that we're a named fiduciary of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| We do have skin in the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| We accept the fiduciary responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| We're honored to have the fiduciary responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| But I think it's important for our role, which is plan design, document review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2660)|
| 0:44:28| the selection and monitoring of the funds, we do have skin in the game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| and we are a named fiduciary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| So there is no confusion about whether or not we're acting in a fiduciary capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| We know that we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| We accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| We do quarterly review meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| It's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| The deferred comp investment committee meetings are open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| We meet at a minimum quarterly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| and we go over the investment options and any issues pertaining to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| Our fee is, we disclose it by contract, a flat $25,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| And I stress flat fee because I do want to make a point that it doesn't matter if the plan grows from $30 million to $130 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2707)|
| 0:45:19| We don't make any more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| Our fee stays the same no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| So when people come up and say, are you for, you know, well, don't you just want to have a deferred comp plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2724)|
| 0:45:30| It doesn't change our compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| It doesn't change what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| And that's by design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| We wanted to have a flat fees disclosed on the participant statement, and it's completely above board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2736)|
| 0:45:44| Prudential is the administrator for the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| They do record keeping, administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| Somebody's got to print the statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| They do investment education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| Jessica Ehlers right here, we'll talk about some of her accomplishments in a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| does an outstanding job with the participants in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| They maintain the plan document, and they make sure that the plan is in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2765)|
| 0:46:12| Their fees are not to exceed 72 basis points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| We'll talk about where it was, 96 basis points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| But their fee is by contract not to exceed 72 basis points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| I would tell you that last year their fee came out to be about 69 basis points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| It is also important to understand that the participants pay Prudential's fee as part of their overall performance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2791)|
| 0:46:40| and it is not a cost that is borne by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2800)|
| 0:46:47| From a plan highlight standpoint, there's definitely a lot that I think the city has to be proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| In the last couple of years since we've been working with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| we successfully converted the plan from nationwide to Prudential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| I would say, from my point of view, the biggest change is we got the annual fee from 96 basis points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2820)|
| 0:47:07| and renegotiated it down to 72 basis points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| and that equates to about $70,000 a year in savings for the participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| And there's no question that that's real money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| We monitor the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| We benchmark the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| And we hold Prudential accountable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| and I would be the first to say that Prudential has done an absolutely outstanding job of living up to what they said they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2844)|
| 0:47:33| We have, on the outset, we wanted to significantly increase participation in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| and we can't give enough credit to Jessica in her efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| Forty percent of the participants in the plan have actually increased their participation in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| If they were deferring five percent of their salary, now they're deferring seven percent of their salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| That is a substantial number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| I do a lot of pension consulting, and I can tell you that is astronomical when you're talking about moving the needle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2878)|
| 0:48:05| And let's not lose sight of the fact that it's only happened in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| Prudential and Jessica have decreased the participants that had 100 percent of their money in the guaranteed fund, the fixed account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2890)|
| 0:48:18| They've decreased that by 47 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| Those are individuals that were so shell-shocked with equities that just put 100 percent of their money in the guaranteed fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2901)|
| 0:48:30| The guaranteed fund, it is guaranteed, but it does have a much lower long-term rate of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2910)|
| 0:48:38| And we've decreased the eligible participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| Those are people who are eligible to participate in the plan that were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| These are new sign-ups, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| We've decreased that pool by 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| So the numbers speak for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| What the deferred compensation plan is doing is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| We've significantly expanded the employee communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| We've done educational seminars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| We've done investment updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| We reach out to the police department, the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| We do meetings here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| We do updates on the investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| On average, we're doing well over anywhere from four to eight educational meetings a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2958)|
| 0:49:27| We do Jessica participates and retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| None of these additional events that we do cost anything for the participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| It's something extra that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| And I would tell you that in roughly two years that 1,584 participants have actually attended our events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2978)|
| 0:49:48| So that is an outstanding number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| It tells you that people are interested in their deferred comp plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| They want to hear the updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| Jessica Ehlers has done an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| In two years, she's met with 1,040 individuals on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| She's had 1,040 meetings with city employees in a two-year basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| Now, if you do the math and you look at 50 weeks a year, she's meeting with a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3012)|
| 0:50:19| And I think that is outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| That, more than anything, is the reason why we're able to move the needle with participation numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3021)|
| 0:50:30| I would tell you that we have a lot to be proud about with the deferred compensation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3030)|
| 0:50:38| It is a tool in retirement planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| It's not the only tool out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| But it is very, very helpful for participants to have a plan that they can defer money in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| that the city matches with a good lineup of investment options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| We make changes to the investment options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| I can assure you that the deferred comp committee holds us accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| And we do make changes on behalf of the participants when we think it we make changes to the lineup where we think appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3061)|
| 0:51:09| There is a tremendous amount of additional information on the intranet site in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3069)|
| 0:51:16| It's open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| Anybody can see the meeting minutes, the investment lineup, the plan document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3077)|
| 0:51:23| I cannot imagine being more transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| And that was with Gary by design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| But you can, there's a web address right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| We certainly have information on the investment committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| We have information on the investment options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| And 100% of the time, I can assure you there's never been a situation where a city employee has called me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| unless it was 5 o'clock in the afternoon, that they did not get a return phone call from me to talk about the various investment options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3104)|
| 0:51:51| We're very responsive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| I would encourage any of you or the city employees to call us with any specific questions they have regarding the plan or the investment option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3113)|
| 0:52:02| And as always, Jessica is meeting with the participants very, very, very often, and she'll certainly continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3122)|
| 0:52:13| So I was asked today to come and just give an update on the deferred compensation plan and talk about the ABCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3133)|
| 0:52:20| It's kind of like crashing two hours into 15 minutes, so I apologize for the brevity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3140)|
| 0:52:27| But I would be more than happy to answer any questions that any of the council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| or any of the employees have regarding the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3152)|
| 0:52:38| Questions of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| Yes, I'm just trying to understand how this fits in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| And this is the voluntary portion of the plan where employees can save in something like a 401K?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3164)|
| 0:52:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| Councilman, it is very, very similar to a 401K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| In fact, if it didn't have 457 status, which means it's not subject to ERISA because it's a governmental plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3177)|
| 0:53:04| it would look and feel exactly like a 401K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| So it is appropriate to think of it as it is a voluntary program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3188)|
| 0:53:14| But it is very, very, very substantially similar to a 401K plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| And I guess this leads me to the question of either in the hybrid plan or in the defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3199)|
| 0:53:27| would this plan take over the management of that fund, or is this just sort of a side story that we're not adjusting right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3207)|
| 0:53:35| I'm trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| It's a very valuable tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| Because you can save pre-tax dollars, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| And grow them for your retirement, working on your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| And you have a pot of money that's yours, I suppose, at the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| That's certainly the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| Now, I've heard it going back to 2008, a 401K became a 201K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| I didn't say the size of the pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Whatever the pot is, it's yours at the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| It absolutely is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| And it's important also, you know, we provide investment consulting services for the retirees in the plan also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3239)|
| 0:54:08| That was, I think, part of the point was to say, you know, whatever the city council decides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| whether it's a hybrid plan or a defined contribution plan, you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3253)|
| 0:54:18| You have it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| And whether you're talking about matching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| This is a vehicle that we have that we can use in either one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| I mean, it's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| And I would tell you, while our fee does not increase with the size of the plan, Prudential's fee will decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3267)|
| 0:54:37| So as the plans grow, it gives us more leveraging power to go back to Prudential and renegotiate the fees lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3277)|
| 0:54:44| But it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| We don't necessarily have a dog in the fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| It doesn't matter if you do the hybrid plan or you do the defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3289)|
| 0:54:55| This is a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| This is a component of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| And it's already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| And it's very, very easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| And is your role then to help design each of the investment packages you can select in that group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3301)|
| 0:55:09| In other words, whether you want guarantee or different levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| We're very engaged with the investment lineup and making sure all the asset classes are represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| We're very involved with the designing of the gold maker portfolios, which have become very, very popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3318)|
| 0:55:24| And, yes, we're very involved with the selection and monitoring of the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| But to make we went from 44 funds in six asset classes to 16 funds in 14 asset classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3329)|
| 0:55:39| I mean, there is a much broader array of funds in the plan now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| And we're always looking to add additional funds where we think it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| But, yeah, we would continue in our role as consultants to the plan, whatever y'all chose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| Final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| And I guess it's hard to answer this because it depends on which of the 16 options or combinations you choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3356)|
| 0:56:02| But is there any experience level that shows how it's doing on average in one or three or five-year pictures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3362)|
| 0:56:09| If you turn to the next – if you turn two more pages, it's not in the slide deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| But you have here a list of the investment options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| We provide this to the city on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| It's got a list of the investment options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| We compare it to the benchmark that we choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| We also compare it to the fund average category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| We do this on a monthly basis, so it spells out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| As you can see, the funds are doing very, very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| They may not beat it on a one-year basis, but they beat it on a three- and a five-year basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| And without getting overly technical, we look at risk-adjusted rates of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| So it's not just the rates of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| It's how much risk are the funds taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| You could have a fund that was up 60 percent last year, but it owned energy stocks and gold stocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3412)|
| 0:57:00| And the risk-adjusted return is out of whack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| Because it could go up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| It could be down 70 percent the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| And we're very, very –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| It swings more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| No question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| There's more of a volatility coefficient associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| And we're very, very sensitive to the risk-adjusted rates of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| I've got two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| Number one, in other words, this plan could be a defined contribution plan for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| It is a defined contribution plan for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| With what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| And then the city could decide to contribute more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| I mean, that's as easy as Jim York's office just – it's a software – I mean, where's Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3458)|
| 0:57:44| Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| Yeah, hey, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| It's very easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| I mean, it's just a matter of whether or not the matching contribution is mandatory or discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| And then it's a payroll transmission avenue at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3474)|
| 0:58:00| I can't stress how easy it is to accomplish either one of the two options I think you guys are considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3480)|
| 0:58:09| Are there other cities that are doing this, just using this as a defined contribution plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3489)|
| 0:58:15| I think there are a lot of cities that are talking about –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3495)|
| 0:58:19| one of the things I would commend the city for doing is having this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| We work with a lot of municipalities that don't want to have this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| You mentioned Rhode Island or Illinois, and the list goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3509)|
| 0:58:34| You know, this is – it's very commendable that you guys are having this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| because I'm eminently convinced that there is a solution and it is fixable long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3519)|
| 0:58:46| You're not working with any particular cities at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| No, we work with other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| Some cities, we're in the initial phases of looking at their feasibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| We're in the process of bidding on several contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| And we work – certainly our firm works with other municipalities on their deferred compensation plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3541)|
| 0:59:09| It seems to be a hotter topic in the state of Tennessee than elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| But as you stated, your fee would be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| Our fee is fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| It doesn't matter if there's $250 million in the deferred compensation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3557)|
| 0:59:22| Our fee does not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| So that is – and keep in mind that as we were able to negotiate the fees from nationwide at 96 basis points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3564)|
| 0:59:34| to prudential at 72 basis points, as the assets grow, we would see that fee come down for the participants as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3574)|
| 0:59:47| 72 basis points equates to 72 one-hundredths of a percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| It is – you know, we do benchmark it to other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| It is a very, very favorable rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| I can tell you that, in my opinion, prudential, it is more than fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| I think the service, the contractual stipulations that we put on them about increasing participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| and enrollment have certainly been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| And I can't imagine that – we certainly think that that fee is fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| Rest assured, what we didn't think, 96 basis points was fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| So it stands to reason that if the assets grow from $30 million to $75 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| that we're going to be renegotiating that fee to get it to a more reasonable level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| And there's absolutely no reason to believe that prudential would not be accommodated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3630)|
| 1:00:36| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| Well, I'm going to go back while he's standing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| But I want to hear – I'm going to go back to Bill's graph in the light blue line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3641)|
| 1:00:47| And you say the cost to the city of Knoxville will be greater on a defined contribution plan as opposed to the hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3647)|
| 1:00:55| And yet he's saying there's no cost to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| Explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| This involves – this is the city's eight and represents the eight percent and ten percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3660)|
| 1:01:06| And if the city is going to be involved in a plan, I'm sure, like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| without any city involvement and no cost, it's just an individual retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| It's just the contributions that you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| Yeah, we're talking – and I could have been more clear about that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| We're just talking about the mandatory contributions to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| I talk about – when I was referring to no cost, I was talking about the administrative costs are borne by the participants, not the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3685)|
| 1:01:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Councilman Dunlop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| I'm trying to clarify something in my mind here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| And one of them has to do with your fee, which is modest and sounds like it's well-earned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3699)|
| 1:01:46| It just strikes me as odd that as assets grow and the more amount of money put in, you guys don't get any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3706)|
| 1:01:52| And I guess the question leads to, do the mutual funds give you a partial percentage or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| Let me be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| Our fee –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| How are you making money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| We're making $25,000, and I think that is a very reasonable fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| And sometimes I kid Gary that we probably deserve more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| I think if you go back and you look at the year that we converted the plan from nationwide to prudential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| should we have gotten more than $25,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| Probably that year we should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| Because you saved money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| Well, we saved –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| $70,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| We saved $70,000 for the participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| There was a lot more work that year than in a traditional year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| But I'm very comfortable that $25,000 is a reasonable fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| We do not receive any compensation from any of the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| Our fee is billed to prudential and is paid by invoice to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3758)|
| 1:02:44| And we certify that that is the only fee that we receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| The second question, or the last question, is I'm looking at the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| you pointed to those pages where you have the different funds, large cap, small cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3771)|
| 1:02:56| And the performance in the three- and six-year phases seem higher than when I turn the page to the gold maker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3776)|
| 1:03:05| which is more like in the 3% or 4% range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| Some of those funds were performing much higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| How do you explain the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| Well, the gold maker is a diversified portfolio that's going to encompass virtually all the asset classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| And it's designed to, like Bill was saying, to control risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3797)|
| 1:03:24| It protects the principal and the growth tends to be modulated down a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3804)|
| 1:03:31| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3811)|
| 1:03:32| Well, it tends to spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| There's no protection, but it tends to spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3814)|
| 1:03:38| It spreads the risk out over more asset classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| What you see is that over time, their performance is more stable than it would be if you just had, for example, a large cap growth fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3821)|
| 1:03:51| That's going to be more volatile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| It is significantly more stable when you look at it over an extended period of time than just owning one fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3833)|
| 1:04:01| Because different classes do differently in different years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| One year it's bonds and the next year it's large caps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| You know, it's one of the things that we watch is – and there actually is a report from Prudential in here –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3847)|
| 1:04:13| that, you know, it's really easy to look and say small cap value did the best last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3853)|
| 1:04:18| or the large cap growth fund is where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| But you have to look at it over a five and ten year period because there's going to be some times when that fund underperforms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3862)|
| 1:04:27| and you can't chase performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| The gold maker portfolios make that virtually impossible by owning virtually all the funds in the lineup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3870)|
| 1:04:38| and by spreading the risk out over a larger number of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| Vice Mayor, I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| With the committee, when you make decisions on what you're going to invest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3889)|
| 1:04:54| do you discuss this with the committee prior to or do you make investments and then it's discussed with the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3894)|
| 1:05:02| We discuss everything with the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3902)|
| 1:05:07| The committee votes as to what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| So there is typically what we would do is we would put a fund on watch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3910)|
| 1:05:16| and then we would vote to remove the fund or keep the fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| It is a democratic process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| I suspect that they would take our recommendation, but let me be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| nothing is done ever without the approval of the investment committee by vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3927)|
| 1:05:35| Now, the people who roll on and off of the committee, for lack of a better word than I can think of in a training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3935)|
| 1:05:41| do they have any type of new people come on the committee, I guess I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3941)|
| 1:05:47| Do you have some type of discussion of their duties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3947)|
| 1:05:52| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| Oh, very much so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| Keep in mind, the committee has only been in place for two years, and so we had two-year appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| And so, I mean, Buddy just rolled off and Joe at the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3958)|
| 1:06:05| So, I mean, we have had some employees roll off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| And we do have a discussion either before they're appointed or before they're selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| Lisa Hatfield, for example, came from the law department when Sharon Boyce retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| When Sharon rolled off, Lisa came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| We certainly have that discussion about what the duties and the roles and responsibilities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| And that's going to be an ongoing conversation that we have with the committee members as they're put on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3985)|
| 1:06:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3993)|
| 1:06:34| And just as a follow-up, and everybody that's on the committee is participating in the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=3994)|
| 1:06:43| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| Gary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| Yeah, I couldn't swear to it, but they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| You know, that's actually a very fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| But, you know, again, I guess technically you could have somebody that was appointed or selected that didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| But I think it's in everyone's best interest to have somebody who's, you know, who's got skin in the game, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4023)|
| 1:07:09| Let me recognize Mr. Pennington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| Yes, Alan Pennington, actuary for the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| Just want to make a quick point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| As the current hybrid plan is designed, it's a little bit like the G-1 plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| which is a type of a hybrid that has a defined benefit component and a defined contribution component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4041)|
| 1:07:28| And all the assets are combined and invested as one, even though it's tracked separately for purposes of the account balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4048)|
| 1:07:35| The current DBDC plus hybrid that's being recommended would work much the same way as it's currently designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4055)|
| 1:07:43| which is all the assets would still be in one pool and invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| They would be broken out into accounts for purposes of tracking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| but it would be available to convert as an annuity at retirement and would still be all one of the same pot of assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4073)|
| 1:08:00| and would not, as it's designed currently, be available to put in a 457 plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4080)|
| 1:08:09| Are there other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| Let me try one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| One more question, Mr. Thompson, and we're going to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| We have been struggling with, when we look at the defined benefit plan, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4096)|
| 1:08:22| one of the things that we struggle with is the assumption of what can it gain on average in a particular year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4102)|
| 1:08:29| And I guess I'm wondering, you have a track record of one year showing in the back on that Goalmaker thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| How do you look at a reasonable return over time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4119)|
| 1:08:40| We'll have more data points over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| The Goalmaker portfolios started when the plan started two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4122)|
| 1:08:48| So, you know, they started, I guess, April of 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| So we really only have one-year returns, and we'll have three-year returns in another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4133)|
| 1:09:02| But we monitor the funds inside the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4142)|
| 1:09:07| And we're very cognizant of the performance of the Goalmaker portfolios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4147)|
| 1:09:13| But it's going to take more time to get more data points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| So it's not running in some other environment where it may have more years of experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| Actually, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| The way they track performance, they're created individually for each plan based on the funds that are available in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4163)|
| 1:09:32| And so it has to start when the program starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| I would say that the portfolios are designed by Morningstar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| And we certainly have capital market rates of return that you would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| And I would tell you the Goalmaker portfolios have done very, very well based on the assumptions that we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| Mr. Thompson, thank you for coming and staying until 6.39 after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| Very beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| I'm going to go to council discussion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| And I'd just like to take a moment, if I could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| and just thank the administration and the employee groups for the hard work that they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4209)|
| 1:10:15| I've been here before and done this, and this is not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| I mean, I've never seen the groups work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4218)|
| 1:10:24| I just want to commend people because pensions and what have you, when you start messing with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| it's just a really, really hard thing to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| I just want to say that I'm in total support of what the administration is bringing forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4232)|
| 1:10:38| I think it's the right thing, not only for the taxpayers but for the employee groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| And as presented, you know, I think that this is a very reasonable plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4243)|
| 1:10:49| and I just appreciate how we've gotten there to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| Now, it doesn't mean that that's going to be the final product, but I think that that's the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| The other end of jumping off the cliff, in my opinion, humble opinion, it's just too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4258)|
| 1:11:04| It's just too opposite-ended to be able to, for me, to swallow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4264)|
| 1:11:11| So, you know, again, I think it's a very fair mix for the employees and the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4271)|
| 1:11:17| And at a minimum, you know, the uniform bodies and the work that is done out in the field is tough work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4277)|
| 1:11:27| And it's different work from what I do and probably what everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| You know, when I sit in my office, you know, I don't have a fear that I'm not going to go home that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4291)|
| 1:11:37| I mean, I'll be honest with you, I may get killed in a car wreck, but in the line of duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| I feel pretty comfortable sitting and doing what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| So you can't really, in my mind, compare business, normal business outside of government to what our folks do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4305)|
| 1:11:54| And that's, you know, another reason that I think that it should be handled differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| and we should keep going down that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| You know, and again, it took $100,000, I think, was what Chief Roush said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| $60,000, what Chief Sharp said, to train an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| And it just starts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| I mean, that's just the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| Then we put them out on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| We've got to equip them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| We've got to, you know, do all the things that we have to do, uniforms and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4336)|
| 1:12:22| And to do that and train them and then to see them go is just a huge disservice to the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4342)|
| 1:12:30| because this is all done on the taxpayers' back because they're the one that's paying the bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4350)|
| 1:12:36| So, you know, we talk about risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| I think there's a risk by not supporting the employees with this plan and have them stay, have them be comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4359)|
| 1:12:47| not have to worry about it and do the job that they're hired to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| So I think that that's very important, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| And then Dr. Lyons hit on something that he and I have been talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| We've got five, basically about five more two-year cycles before anybody even invests in what the voters are eventually going to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4378)|
| 1:13:08| So we've got time to be able to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| I see Ms. Hatfield out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| I don't want to put you on the spot, but I'm going to a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| I know you probably can't answer with certainty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| but I'm sure with the help of Mr. Swanson's team that you all could in some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4400)|
| 1:13:27| or I feel confident that you could advise new hires coming in that there's a disclaimer or something along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4407)|
| 1:13:38| We actually do for all new hires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| Every new hire has to go through a new hire orientation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| At the latest, it's going to be within 30 days of their hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| It's usually sooner than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| I think we're actually doing them every two weeks now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| We actually do have pension come to that new hire orientation and do a presentation for all new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4433)|
| 1:13:59| So right when they're hired, they're told how the pension plan works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| They're told when they will vest, what their options will be, what things they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| They do their paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| They sign receipt of all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| So we already make sure that all employees are given that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| When they're hired, that will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| We'll just change that information that they're given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| Well, that's fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| But, again, I just want to stress that we've got a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| We've got a minimum of four two-year cycles and closer to probably five two-year cycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4466)|
| 1:14:32| So, Dr. Lyons and all the employee groups, I want to thank you for where you've taken it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4472)|
| 1:14:38| And I just want to do you know, I've listened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| I haven't said much during the whole time, but I just want to say I think we're getting close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4480)|
| 1:14:45| and I'm supportive of what the administration has brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| I, too, have been fairly silent because last week I couldn't talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| But I do have a lot of concerns about the path we're taking and the proposals that are on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4495)|
| 1:15:02| Risk is in everything that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| And I am very, very concerned that moving to a defined compensation plan is very risky for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4506)|
| 1:15:17| and it's also a very radical move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| I have also looked at the information we've received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| I've gone online, checked around, and lots of cities, lots of counties are talking about plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4524)|
| 1:15:31| but I'm not seeing anybody rushing down the pathway to go to a defined or deferred compensation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4531)|
| 1:15:39| because it is extremely risky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| It's risky for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| It's risky for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| It's risky for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| And the taxpayer risk comes if we take that path, we're going to have to seriously look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4548)|
| 1:15:56| and do something about our compensation for employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| because part of the compensation package includes these benefits of a retirement plan as well as the health and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4561)|
| 1:16:08| So if we take the path, the radical path of deferred compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4568)|
| 1:16:14| then we're going to have to look at some really serious examination of the compensation excluding the benefit package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4574)|
| 1:16:22| because people are not going to come to work for the city at the rates that we pay for many jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| whether it's a uniformed officer or someone who is doing other tasks that we expect to have occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4588)|
| 1:16:36| Those people are not going to want to come and work here if they don't have some carrot at the end of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4596)|
| 1:16:43| I think the mayor has looked at the issue and her advisors very, very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4603)|
| 1:16:49| and they have pulled the best of all the worlds together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| Is it perfect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4613)|
| 1:16:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4614)|
| 1:16:55| There's not going to ever be a perfect plan for anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| But what it does is take into consideration that those employees who are paid the least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4619)|
| 1:17:06| and have the least amount of money available to look toward a retirement plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4626)|
| 1:17:13| if it's a defined compensation, those employees are going to have a really tough time making it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4633)|
| 1:17:21| I think Ms. Hatfield told us a couple of meetings ago, somebody brings home $240 every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4641)|
| 1:17:29| Perhaps that person has a couple of kids or maybe it's just a husband and wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| They don't have a lot of money, and the last thing they're thinking about is retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| and putting money into a retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| We ask our employees to do very difficult tasks in many instances that physically are very, very demanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4661)|
| 1:17:51| and are not the kind of tasks that a person can continue to do at 60 or 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4671)|
| 1:17:59| I've had firefighters come to my house for emergency calls to help someone who had fallen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| and I was really pretty glad to have a younger person there because it was not a lightweight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| that they were helping pick up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| I've had police officers come to a business not here but someplace else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4690)|
| 1:18:16| and I was always glad when there was someone who was fairly young and agile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| And I'm not taking a hit at those who are seasoned because we need seasoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4700)|
| 1:18:26| Certainly I fall into that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| Bested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| But what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| Stewing chicken, I think, is what it's called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| But what we need is that whole variety of experience and history that comes with a retirement plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4714)|
| 1:18:41| that considers everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| I think that the $40,000 salary level to then go to another plan, I think that's very reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4723)|
| 1:18:55| But I'm flexible on some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| I will say that the drop plan was something that was very foreign to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4737)|
| 1:19:03| The rule of 80 was not anything I had ever experienced or heard until I came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| I thought it seemed like a pretty good idea, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| But I also think that that's probably something that, like many plans, whose time has come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4750)|
| 1:19:16| When those rules were adopted 20, 30, 40, 50, how many ever years ago, they were great ideas at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4756)|
| 1:19:23| But, as you know, we live in a different time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| I think that Morgan Keegan and Prudential do a fine job for what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4766)|
| 1:19:31| but I really don't think that they are going to provide the total answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| So I'm going to be supporting a hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| It may look exactly like what Dr. Lyons identified tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| We may tinker with it and toy with it, but I think that that's the plan that the voters will most support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4783)|
| 1:19:51| I've heard from people, maybe not as many as some of my colleagues, but I've heard from a number of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4791)|
| 1:19:58| and I find that the wealthier you are, the more likely you are to support defined compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4798)|
| 1:20:08| The more you work with your hands or you work in a job that might cause you to sweat outdoors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4808)|
| 1:20:15| or might just cause you to not be as comfortable, you're looking for something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| And until we can get our pay levels to such a point that everyone can easily afford to contribute to a defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4820)|
| 1:20:30| put food on their table, shoe their kids, and have a little extra money to go to Dollywood or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4830)|
| 1:20:37| I think that we need to follow the hybrid plan and work on that and hash out the differences in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4837)|
| 1:20:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| Thanks, Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| I think that what we've done, we agreed conceptually anyway to set aside and to freeze the current pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4855)|
| 1:21:06| and look for a new option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| And Dr. Lyons has presented a couple options unbeknownst to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| He came back with a revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| I, too, have come tonight with my own revision to their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| There's several things that concern me about I can support a hybrid plan if some of the switches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4879)|
| 1:21:27| or what I would call some of the controls are left back to this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4887)|
| 1:21:32| The COLA ought to be reviewed by the administration and ought to come back to council for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| If we had the money, we would put more money into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| If we don't have the money, then we would not be able to offer raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| And same with the increases each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| Those things are toggle switches that the council are part of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| If you have the money, then you can afford it and you would buy into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4912)|
| 1:21:57| I think the $40,000 is too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| It's too high and puts too much risk back on this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| I think the city should support some type of risk on a pension plan for their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4925)|
| 1:22:11| I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| Their estimations, I think, is at 70 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| I think pulling the number down to $20,000 for an employee, for a government employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4935)|
| 1:22:22| and $25,000 for your fire and police would make this more reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| Starting salary is $31,000 for a policeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| So I think there's a way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| I think you can adjust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| The other thing that you can adjust is the amount of time it takes to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| And I think for your average government employee, I would recommend 65 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4958)|
| 1:22:42| These are the things that you can adjust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| And you can adjust this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| You can adjust it by, you know, if you leave it out and you write it as we've been told all along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4965)|
| 1:22:52| if we write it the way we want it, we can change it by ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| and not to be subjected into the charter where it's automatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4976)|
| 1:23:00| So I think that we could you can work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| I think you can work the details out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4985)|
| 1:23:06| But it's got to be these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| And he came tonight with one of the suggestions that I had, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4988)|
| 1:23:13| I think there's even more control that this body ought to have in regards to the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| in regards to the amount of money as it goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| So here's my plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| I'll submit it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| And I took his style and I just basically just copied it, copied the way he presented it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5003)|
| 1:23:32| And it just toggle switches some of the things we've been talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5012)|
| 1:23:40| You know, I think it's got to be affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| It's got to be competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5022)|
| 1:23:43| And it's got to be sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| And we've got to find something that will meet all three of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| And I think, you know, if we set it right, if we can't have those controls at this level through the city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5029)|
| 1:24:00| then I can't support a hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5040)|
| 1:24:06| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5048)|
| 1:24:09| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| Well, I do support the recommendation made in the new Sentinel editorial this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| the defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| And I'll tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| That really does take us to a known position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5060)|
| 1:24:25| All the defined benefit plans, no matter what you look at in terms of the charts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5065)|
| 1:24:32| we really do not know what our liability is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| Last year, the 2011, end of June 2011, our plan liability, our total liability in our current plan was $590 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5077)|
| 1:24:51| We had $468 million worth of assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5091)|
| 1:24:57| We now have $460 million worth of assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| And that was at an assumed rate of 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| We lowered that assumed rate to seven and three-eighths, and that gave us a total liability of $645 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5106)|
| 1:25:15| We still have $460 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| The difference is $185 million, which we are liable for, we the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5117)|
| 1:25:26| If you run that down to five and three-eighths percent, which is, if you look at the 20-year average of our growth in our plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5126)|
| 1:25:34| that's about what it is, that gives us a total liability of $775 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5134)|
| 1:25:42| or a difference of $305 million that the taxpayers are liable for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5142)|
| 1:25:48| If we do a defined contribution plan, we know exactly what our liability is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5148)|
| 1:25:54| It doesn't fluctuate with the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| We know every employee is going to get in the plan that's suggested, the defined contribution plan, 6% from the employee, 8% general government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5156)|
| 1:26:08| and 10% in the uniformed services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| That's either 16% or 14% for those two bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5172)|
| 1:26:18| I think that is very fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| In fact, that is a fairly rich plan, actually, whether you compare it with other governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5180)|
| 1:26:26| or certainly with the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| I was going to clarify a quick point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| The total return over the 20 years was about 7.8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5192)|
| 1:26:36| And that's the return that we were assuming over that period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| So we actually did make the return assumption over that period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| 5.6% is just the component of that total return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| So I don't really think that's an appropriate number to use for this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| That's the number I'm going to stick with because that was in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5211)|
| 1:27:00| What is the 20-year return?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| The 20-year total return was 7.8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| That includes inflation and includes backing out the expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| The 5.6% is the real return component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| That's one component of the total return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| It's not the total return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| Let me bring order back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| Councilman Saunders has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| I appreciate those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| I don't agree with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5244)|
| 1:27:28| The new GASB rule is going to suggest that we actually realize whatever the real rate of return is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5248)|
| 1:27:37| which is somewhere in the neighborhood of 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| If, in fact, that occurs, whether it's suggestion or real, I mean, whether we have to realize the liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5259)|
| 1:27:47| our total liability is going to be up around $900 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| Now, I have a great discomfort going to our taxpayers and saying, you're on the hook for whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5271)|
| 1:27:59| whether it's $130 million, $185 million, $305 million, $600 million or $400 million, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5279)|
| 1:28:08| It's an enormous number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| Even if we smooth it out over so many years, people keep saying, well, $20 million, that's just next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5290)|
| 1:28:16| That's not our total liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| That's a smoothing effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| So if you go with the defined contribution plan, if we ask the taxpayers to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5302)|
| 1:28:30| or the voters to consider that this year and they accept that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| it doesn't mean that if things get a whole lot or change a lot, and hopefully for the positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5314)|
| 1:28:39| that we can't come back in two years, four years, six years, eight years and make additional changes to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5319)|
| 1:28:44| But if we start from a higher base, the $40,000 or $25,000 or whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5324)|
| 1:28:51| we have locked ourselves in without really knowing what our liability is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| Mr. Pennington can't tell us what that real liability is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| He can make projections based on various assumptive returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5339)|
| 1:29:03| But, in fact, we really don't know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| With the defined contribution plan, you do know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| And we can tell the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| And so when we go back, and we're dealing with part of the plan here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| because we've already said to the employees that are here now that we're not going to affect you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5356)|
| 1:29:21| You are going to be on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| This is for anything going forward after some certain date, and it may be January 1st of next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5363)|
| 1:29:28| or whatever date is picked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| But I'm very uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| And, therefore, I do support the defined contribution plan straight up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5372)|
| 1:29:37| Thank you, Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| Councilman Starr, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| Yes, I'm just still confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| What is our 20-year rate of return?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| One a year, the rate of return that we would compare to the seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| and three-quarter percent assumption over the same period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| In other words, we assumed in the valuation seven and a half percent for a period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| Well, when you say what the correct number is, it depends on what you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| I'm just trying to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| Okay, here's my assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| If I have $100 and at the end of the year I have $105, then I think my rate of return is 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5411)|
| 1:30:17| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5417)|
| 1:30:18| Yes, 7.8% is the right number then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| By that analysis, 7.8% will be the 20-year return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5420)|
| 1:30:25| Well, but I still only have $105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| I don't have $107.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| In that scenario, 5% would be the real return, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| So I'm saying if that's your definition of how to define return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5436)|
| 1:30:40| if the definition is you look at the number at the end of the year compared to the beginning of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5440)|
| 1:30:45| in your scenario it's 5%, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| And if you apply that same methodology to the 20-year return of the pension plan, it would be 7.8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5448)|
| 1:30:59| That's why he's an insurer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5459)|
| 1:31:05| I'm still confused on how inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| I mean, you have how much money you have at the end of the time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| If inflation was zero in your example, then you have $5 more of spending power at the end of the year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5470)|
| 1:31:18| You could buy $5 more with the goods and services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| If inflation was 5%, then you can't buy anything more at the end of the year than the beginning of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5481)|
| 1:31:27| because everything's been inflated 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| That's what inflation is, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| So wouldn't that drive the number down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5492)|
| 1:31:38| If you count inflation in, then it seems like it would drive your number down, not up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| because your dollars, your real return is, let's just keep it simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5503)|
| 1:31:49| One year, 5% return on $100, and inflation is 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| At the end of the year, you have $105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| How does a 2% factor in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5518)|
| 1:32:02| How could you say, I mean, so you're telling me it sounds like you're saying that that's a 7% return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5522)|
| 1:32:07| because inflation is 2%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| You don't add it back in again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| You either start with the components and add them up, or you start with the total and back it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| In your example, 5% would be the total return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| And did you say 2% was inflation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5544)|
| 1:32:25| So then 3% would be the real return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5545)|
| 1:32:26| So 2% you know, 3% real return, 2% inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5546)|
| 1:32:31| That means at the end of the year, you've got a total of 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5551)|
| 1:32:35| What's the real return?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| The real return in that example is 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| You've got 2% inflation, 3% real return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| Okay, I think I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| In my example, the 20-year real return is 5.6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5565)|
| 1:32:50| Inflation was about 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| And then there's also an expense component because you want to back out the cost of expenses being paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5572)|
| 1:32:59| But it ends up netting out to about 7.8% when you add those numbers together, the total return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5579)|
| 1:33:05| I beg your pardon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5585)|
| 1:33:06| On your own report, investment return, 2011 study, historical real returns, Knoxville, 20 years, 5.6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5586)|
| 1:33:16| Market returns, 80 years, 6.23%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| Average real return, 5.91%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| It doesn't mention inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| Well, if you turn to the next page, I think you'll see where inflation is being added onto those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| No historical returns, 5.91%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| Market expectation, 4.67%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| When it comes up with a total expectation, it adds inflation back into that and subtracts out investment expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5612)|
| 1:33:39| Yeah, well, I must say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| On the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| The point is our fund is not as large as it was at the beginning of our year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5623)|
| 1:33:49| It's down by $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| Now, I understand well that we take in and we pay out $40 million plus, and we add to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5632)|
| 1:33:59| and there's a market appreciation and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| But, in fact, the total corpus is less than it was at the beginning of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| And that's what I call return, exactly what Mr. Stier was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| If I start with $100 and at the end of the year I have $95, I've had a loss, you know, better than a 5% loss, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5650)|
| 1:34:20| Or if I've made $5, at the end of the year I have $105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| And I understand income and outgoings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| With respect to everybody's time, I'll be happy to meet with you one-on-one after this and go over all these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5666)|
| 1:34:32| I mean, I've tried to put it in simple terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| I'm not sure I can make any more progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5678)|
| 1:34:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5684)|
| 1:34:45| I was actually going to ask the same line of questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5685)|
| 1:34:48| And I looked at your annual report, the full-length report that you put out as of July 1, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5688)|
| 1:34:56| And in the report and in your experience report as well, you have four columns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5696)|
| 1:35:02| I'm going to make up four dumb columns because I don't have time to write it out or project it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5702)|
| 1:35:07| But one was called the real rate of return, and that's what they were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| One was called the administrative cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| That's the cost of running the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| The third column was an inflation factor for that particular time frame, and that was in the third column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5715)|
| 1:35:21| And the fourth column had a total return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| Now, there's really a definitional problem, and maybe we can all understand what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5723)|
| 1:35:29| When you say the real rate of return, I hear Finbar saying that's what I actually earned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5729)|
| 1:35:35| You may be saying that's what I actually earned, less inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| I don't know what your definition is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| But I understand that there was something called the rate of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| You called it the real rate of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| You take out a half a percent as the cost of administering the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| That makes sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| There's an inflation factor, and that's the debate I heard what Marshall was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5750)|
| 1:35:55| before that you add back in to get a total return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| So I think it's a definitional problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| And to help us understand it, what do you call the real rate of return?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| What does that mean in your field of expertise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5764)|
| 1:36:09| Because I think that's where the confusion is coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| Is that earnings less inflation, and then you add it back at the end to get it in inflated dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5772)|
| 1:36:18| What are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5778)|
| 1:36:19| Well, the real return is the increase in buying power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5779)|
| 1:36:24| So how much increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| So you account for inflation then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5787)|
| 1:36:28| If you put inflation in, then that's the total return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| It may be easier to define total return first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| Okay, do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| That's the last part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| Let's just ignore expenses for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| Ignore benefit payments and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| The total return, if you have $105 at the end of the year and $100 at the beginning of the year, the total return is 5 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5801)|
| 1:36:48| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| That's 5 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| Now, what was inflation during the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| But he said if it was 2 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| It's 2 percent inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| And you've got less buying power, so you've got $3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| Three percent, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5818)|
| 1:36:59| Three percent real increase in your buying power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| So that 3 percent real increase would be comparable to the 5.6 percent that you see in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5822)|
| 1:37:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| And when you talk about the 7.8 percent, what does that number reflect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| Is that buying power?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| Is that simply growth in the number of dollars in the pot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| What are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| It's the total growth in the pot minus expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| Everyone understands the expense part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| That's just the cost of doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| But if I say 7.8 and I say, well, if I don't back out the expenses, then I'm talking like more 8.3 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5849)|
| 1:37:35| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| That's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5856)|
| 1:37:37| So the 7.8 that you say you're left with, that's an absolute number of earnings or that's buying power?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5857)|
| 1:37:44| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5864)|
| 1:37:45| That's the absolute total earnings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| In buying power, it might be less because inflation has reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5870)|
| 1:37:51| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5871)|
| 1:37:52| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| You got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| You know, I think the one thing I've learned in the last four workshops, and this is, you know, I'm not throwing darts at anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5879)|
| 1:38:08| but it's kind of obvious to me that we're throwing numbers all around that nobody knows what's happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5888)|
| 1:38:15| And we kind of can't get an answer on really what is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5895)|
| 1:38:21| The one thing that I do know is that if we have a defined contribution plan where we know we're going to put in so much money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5901)|
| 1:38:30| and the employee is going to put in so much money, we know what that's going to be each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5910)|
| 1:38:35| because we don't know what's going to happen in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| And we have experts sitting out here who are throwing all these numbers around that I'm not sure what they mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5919)|
| 1:38:45| You know, I'm definitely not an expert in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| But I do know that it seems to me that the hybrid plan is kind of, and I'm going to use this word, and I don't, Dr. Lyons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5928)|
| 1:38:56| I don't mean it the way it's going to sound, but to me it sounds like a cover-up of the original plan that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5936)|
| 1:39:03| And by a cover-up, what I mean is that we're going to get ourselves in the same situation in a couple of years that we're in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5943)|
| 1:39:10| Whereas if we go with a defined contribution plan where we can say we're going to put in so much money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5950)|
| 1:39:17| the employee is going to put in so much money, and then if we want to add to whatever, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5957)|
| 1:39:23| But if we lock ourselves into even something like this now, you know, what's it really going to cost us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5963)|
| 1:39:29| I mean, I look at all these charts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| I don't know the latest chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| How much is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5974)|
| 1:39:35| All I know is for sure that we're going to be putting $24.5 million into the pension plan this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5975)|
| 1:39:44| We're taking $10 million out of reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| We're putting in an additional $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| I believe these numbers are right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5990)|
| 1:39:51| I'm throwing numbers around now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| And I'm thinking to myself, now, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| We're going to be taking this money, and each year we're going to be adding more to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| because next year it's going to be more than $12.5 million, according to charts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| And I'm looking at – I'm driving on roads that have potholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6007)|
| 1:40:13| I'm walking down streets that don't have sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6013)|
| 1:40:16| I'm definitely not going to get to trees this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| We're supposed to be a green city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| I'm looking at the employees that we have, and, you know, and that's the other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6020)|
| 1:40:25| We're not the bad guys sitting up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| What we're trying to do is we're trying to come up with a solution to a real serious problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6027)|
| 1:40:33| Now, one of the things we've already said, I think, we've agreed that we're going to take care of all our existing employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6033)|
| 1:40:41| those that are vested and not vested, and those new employees coming in at a certain time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| That in itself, I think, is a huge obligation and a huge commitment that we have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6045)|
| 1:40:51| I think that what we're trying to do is we know we have that problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6051)|
| 1:40:56| and we're bleeding pretty heavily over here on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| Now what we're trying to do is to come up with a plan that is going to deal with new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6059)|
| 1:41:04| And we can sit up here, and all of us can say, yeah, we're not going to be able to hire people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| people aren't going to come, and we don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| We actually do not know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6071)|
| 1:41:13| I've talked to some other cities that are hiring people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| and talked to some other cities that are dealing with the same kind of problem that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6076)|
| 1:41:20| So, you know, we could sit here for the next I don't know how many meetings, and again, with all these numbers and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6080)|
| 1:41:27| but the bottom line is we've got a commitment this year of coming up with the $25 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6087)|
| 1:41:32| that we're having to pay to the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| We're going to have to pay a bunch of money next year, and we know that this has gone out according to all these charts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| And so it seems to me that what we ought to do from the taxpayer standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6100)|
| 1:41:45| and those folks that have talked to me is, number one, keep it simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6105)|
| 1:41:50| come up with a defined contribution plan that is fair to both the employee and to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6110)|
| 1:41:58| and then look to the future and not put something like this hybrid plan, again, on my children that live here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6118)|
| 1:42:06| and pay taxes and my grandchildren that are going to be living here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6126)|
| 1:42:09| and have them deal with a situation in 20 years that we're dealing with right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6129)|
| 1:42:14| So, you know, again, I think we ought to keep it simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| And, again, we're hearing all these numbers about what if this and what if that and what if this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6137)|
| 1:42:22| and we don't know in terms of the what ifs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| And so I just think that we need to look at something very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6145)|
| 1:42:30| I think the new Sentinel article, I think they hit a lot of good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| And so I think if there's some way that we can develop a defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6154)|
| 1:42:39| that's the one that I would certainly want to look at pretty seriously on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6159)|
| 1:42:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6163)|
| 1:42:44| Thank you, Councilman Gregg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6164)|
| 1:42:45| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6165)|
| 1:42:46| Oh, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| Vice Mayor, I've been sitting and listening to our workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| and I am very sensitive to pensions because I draw a civil service pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6171)|
| 1:43:00| And I worked for two years, two years in the military, eight years at the VA hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6180)|
| 1:43:07| and the rest of that time for the United States Postal Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| So I'm very sensitive to pensions and people who draw pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6191)|
| 1:43:17| I'm hopeful that when we get to a point where we actually vote upon something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6197)|
| 1:43:23| we'll have a balance, something where the taxpayers will not go deeply in the hole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6203)|
| 1:43:33| and we'll not have to lay off employees and cut back services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6213)|
| 1:43:39| And I think we are ahead of the game here in this city by the fact that we're doing what we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6219)|
| 1:43:47| I don't think we're at an emergency situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| We've had a task force that said it's unsustainable, but at least we are discussing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6230)|
| 1:43:56| So, therefore, we are somewhat ahead of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| But I just wanted to make that statement that I, myself, am very sensitive to pension issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6240)|
| 1:44:07| And I think I'm leaning right now towards the mayor's plan and the hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6247)|
| 1:44:15| something that I think would be good and would be good for the new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6255)|
| 1:44:21| So I just wanted to make that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6263)|
| 1:44:24| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6264)|
| 1:44:30| Well, I think kind of back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| There's no plan here today that we're going to come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| It's just going to solve our problem for the next 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| So, I mean, we can define contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| It doesn't get us any closer to solving our problems for the next 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| And the hybrid plan doesn't get us any closer to solving our problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| I mean, that issue is off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| And all that is a mute point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| We've decided we're going to close the existing plan and we're going to come up with something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| I think you've got to find something that is sustainable and that you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| There is some risk the city ought to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| And that I'm willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6305)|
| 1:45:10| But you've got to leave some of the controls with that right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| The biggest problem that our plan got us into now is that the controls are all inside the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6313)|
| 1:45:19| And you can't control any of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| You couldn't stop COLA if you wanted to, unless you go to referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| And I think that that's the really important aspect of my plan or their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6325)|
| 1:45:31| To me, the plans is my plan says you can control those costs right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| And we can decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6335)|
| 1:45:36| And it all must be related back to the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6336)|
| 1:45:41| What my company does for contributions is it's based on profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6341)|
| 1:45:47| If I have profit, we put it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| If we don't, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6349)|
| 1:45:50| And that's what I'm saying here is that if we had the money and the budget, then you'd give them a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6350)|
| 1:45:55| If you don't, you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| You control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| There's some defined benefit in what they get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| But then there's also the responsibility is to be put on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6360)|
| 1:46:04| My suggestion is you pull that blue line down and not contribute more than what they contribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6364)|
| 1:46:10| If they put in 6 percent, we put in 6 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| You don't contribute 120 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| I mean, you match it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6376)|
| 1:46:17| You've heard, you know, I think you match what they put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6377)|
| 1:46:20| And they can put in more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| They don't have to put in 6 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6382)|
| 1:46:23| You can write it and they can put in as much as they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6383)|
| 1:46:27| But I think that's how you control the, you know, lines, this blue line is you limit how much you're going to put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6387)|
| 1:46:33| And I think you match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6393)|
| 1:46:34| And I think there ought to be some differentiations between your fire and police and your general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6394)|
| 1:46:41| And they deserve a lower retirement age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| Sixty-five is not an unreasonable retirement age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| I plan on working until way past 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| I mean, I'm going to have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| But that's a, you know, that's always arguable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| But that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6417)|
| 1:46:58| Councilman Campin, were you wanting to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| Let me go to Mr. Pennington first and then I'll come back to this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6421)|
| 1:47:08| I just want to first of all say thank you for the opportunity to address the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| and thank you for the opportunity to work with the city on its pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| I've been privileged to have been associated with the plan in one way or another for about 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6436)|
| 1:47:21| And it's been a real honor to work with the folks over here in the different administrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| and most recently with Mr. Cherry and Mr. Gilbert and with several of the employees for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6446)|
| 1:47:33| I'd respectfully ask the city employees, if I say something you like, to hold your applause to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6453)|
| 1:47:37| I think the council pretty well knows what your thoughts are on this at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6457)|
| 1:47:43| But my job is not to be an advocate for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| My job is not to be an advocate for the administration, and it's not to be an advocate for the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6466)|
| 1:47:51| It's simply to look at the numbers, to run the numbers, to show you how different assumptions run out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6471)|
| 1:47:56| and at times, you know, maybe to suggest an opinion based on my experience or based on reading I've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6476)|
| 1:48:03| Over the last couple of weeks, I have reviewed probably a dozen studies that I've done for different state plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6483)|
| 1:48:09| Colorado, Minnesota, and I've got copies of those if anybody wants to look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6489)|
| 1:48:13| Gabriel, Ryder, Smith, Millman, whatever, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| I agree 100 percent with what Mr. Greaves said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| If you put a defined contribution plan in, you know how much your contribution is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| There's no question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| It's very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6506)|
| 1:48:27| And it's also very clear that nobody wants to get back into the situation that we're now in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6507)|
| 1:48:32| with an unpredictable, huge, enormous contribution facing the city that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6512)|
| 1:48:41| said to me, well, how are we going to pay for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| I don't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| But the question then becomes, is the problem the defined benefit plan or is the problem something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6525)|
| 1:48:53| And, you know, from where I'm standing today, what I will submit to you is that if the retiree liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6533)|
| 1:49:02| the people that were inactive in the defined benefit plan, if those benefits had been fully funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6542)|
| 1:49:07| and they had stayed fully funded either by immunizing or purchasing, you know, fixed income or, you know, what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6547)|
| 1:49:15| yes, that would have been relatively more expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| but then you would have had maybe $150 million of assets exposed, not $550 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6557)|
| 1:49:25| So what I'm saying is I think there's a way to have a defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6565)|
| 1:49:29| I'm right now speaking with the investment committee and the board about some de-risking options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| about how to do that exact thing with the current plan, whether or not you go with a hybrid or whether you go with a D.C. plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6574)|
| 1:49:41| You know, I think de-risking is going to become a part of whatever defined benefit plan is in the system, and I applaud that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6581)|
| 1:49:49| I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| The one thing that concerns me greatly, if a defined contribution plan was my only plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6591)|
| 1:49:57| I can say a lot of things about defined contribution, investment return expenses, turnover rates, loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6597)|
| 1:50:03| you know, not being used for retirement because of all these different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6603)|
| 1:50:07| But the number one reason that I would suggest a defined benefit plan is superior to defined contribution is what's called mortality risk sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6607)|
| 1:50:18| And what that means is if you've got, let's say, 500 people that retire, and they all have $600,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6618)|
| 1:50:25| and that's expected to last their average lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6625)|
| 1:50:29| So let's say they're 62, and on average they're expected to live to age 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6629)|
| 1:50:34| In a defined contribution plan, on average, everybody's going to have enough money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6634)|
| 1:50:39| But in reality, half those people aren't going to have enough money because they're going to outlive those assets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| and half those people are going to have more money than they need because they're going to die sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| So, and because in a defined contribution plan you're giving people $500,000 who probably never had more than $5,000 in their bank account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6649)|
| 1:50:58| their whole lives and say, here, manage this, a lot of people aren't going to do a good job managing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6658)|
| 1:51:03| So rather than half the people having enough money, maybe you have 25% of the people that really have a meaningful retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6663)|
| 1:51:10| When you accumulate the same amount of assets that if you had in a defined benefit plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6670)|
| 1:51:14| all of those people would have a guaranteed lifetime benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| And that's not to say that there's not some changes that I think are appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| I think the things you are thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| I've been working with Dr. Lyons and with the mayor to try to come up with something that has less risk for the city by, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6683)|
| 1:51:32| having this hybrid type plan, which I think is a fabulous idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| I think investing the assets more conservatively so you have less volatility is a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6696)|
| 1:51:41| A defined contribution plan can be a good retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| That's my retirement plan with my employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| I don't work for the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| I work for a private employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| We don't have an open defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| And because of the rules that apply to the private sector, defined benefit plans are very difficult to maintain in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6712)|
| 1:51:59| Same rules don't apply in the government sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| That's a whole different discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| But in any event, I applaud the mayor and the administration for the effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6723)|
| 1:52:07| I think the hybrid makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| But I think no matter what you do, you're going to give a good retirement plan to the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6729)|
| 1:52:14| And I'm just, you know, like I said, privileged to work with you guys and work with the city and everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6734)|
| 1:52:20| So thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6743)|
| 1:52:24| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| Alan, thank you also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| You are the one who brought the de-risking idea to the pension board, I believe, in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6747)|
| 1:52:32| And, of course, I have read about that, and that's part of where I've gotten some of the figures that we talked about the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6752)|
| 1:52:38| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6758)|
| 1:52:39| And I also wanted to thank the mayor and the staff, the mayor's staff, for putting all of this on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6759)|
| 1:52:46| I knew this discussion was going to be a tough discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| But I will also parrot what all those who spoke, the citizens who spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6769)|
| 1:52:57| We do have very good employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6777)|
| 1:53:00| And I believe firmly that if we put a defined contribution plan in place, that would continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6780)|
| 1:53:07| We are a very desirable place to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| As Vicky has indicated, we have about a 2% turnover, as I believe you said last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6789)|
| 1:53:16| With that, for the next couple of years, we can anticipate maybe hiring 60 or 80 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6796)|
| 1:53:23| We're a very stable place to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6803)|
| 1:53:25| And I think we have already taken off the table the people who work with us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6805)|
| 1:53:32| We're going to protect them and make sure that they get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| It's just going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6815)|
| 1:53:36| Now, at some point, we've got to address, and this is not the discussion right now, how are we going to pay for the liability that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6816)|
| 1:53:44| So that's a discussion for another day, but we will certainly have to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6828)|
| 1:53:49| Thank you, Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| Councilman Stager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6831)|
| 1:53:52| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| And, again, I'd reiterate a lot of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6834)|
| 1:53:56| We have fantastic employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6836)|
| 1:53:59| And I think that's important to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6839)|
| 1:54:00| We're not talking about our current employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| As we talk about retention, nothing we do here should affect the retention of the employees we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6843)|
| 1:54:09| But I've heard a lot of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| One is I've heard that, you know, we're going off a cliff, no one's done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6851)|
| 1:54:15| This is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| Johnson City in 2010 went to a defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6857)|
| 1:54:22| They have a 5% mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| The city does 5% and then matches up to 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6864)|
| 1:54:30| Kingsport recently changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| They do a 5% mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| The city does a 5%, and they also match up to 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| That's going into place June 30, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6878)|
| 1:54:43| Murfreesboro, population over 100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| In July of 2010, they switched to a defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6886)|
| 1:54:52| They put in 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| The city does 3%, and they match up to 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6893)|
| 1:54:57| This is Murfreesboro, not the same size as Knoxville, but let's face it, they're very close to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6897)|
| 1:55:04| So they did that knowing that those employees could move to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6904)|
| 1:55:10| So to say that there's no other cities that have done this, that we're jumping off a cliff, I think that's inaccurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6910)|
| 1:55:17| and that we're being provided misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6917)|
| 1:55:23| In terms of retention recruitment, I fully understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| This is a tool that helps with retention and recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6927)|
| 1:55:31| I do not deny that, but it comes at a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| And the problem for me is we don't know what that cost is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| It's a black box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6937)|
| 1:55:39| It may be low if the market does well, and it may be high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| But do we want a cost that's hooked to the stock market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6942)|
| 1:55:46| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6946)|
| 1:55:47| And I'd certainly agree with Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6947)|
| 1:55:50| If we make a change to a defined contribution plan, I think we certainly have to look at salaries for those new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6950)|
| 1:55:58| And sort of what's been frustrating is everything's been compared to the administration's defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6958)|
| 1:56:06| which looks very different from these three plans and looks extremely different from the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6966)|
| 1:56:12| Think about the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| They use benefits to recruit and retain as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6974)|
| 1:56:18| And if you look at the private sector, most of them hover around 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| Now, those employers, they know they could put more in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| but they know that the primary driver for retention and recruitment is salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6985)|
| 1:56:30| So they put those dollars in the salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| And so to be talking about 8% and 10%, a defined contribution plan is not, it's limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=6993)|
| 1:56:41| And looking at graphs, comparing that, you know, I think salaries would be a big part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7001)|
| 1:56:47| and that's a conversation we would have at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7007)|
| 1:56:51| The other thing you can do with a defined contribution is you have vesting schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7011)|
| 1:56:56| So the city's contribution into the plan, the employee does not have rights to that money until after a certain number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7016)|
| 1:57:05| So if it costs a lot of money to train an employee, well, if they leave, you know, less than five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7025)|
| 1:57:10| then the city would get that money back that it's put into the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7030)|
| 1:57:15| You know, right now, the numbers I got were paying 24% of payroll for fire and police pension benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7035)|
| 1:57:22| and 13% to 15% for general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7042)|
| 1:57:26| And we've got this retention and recruitment tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7046)|
| 1:57:31| I think that's a very, very expensive retention and recruitment tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7051)|
| 1:57:36| I think we could, with that 24%, you could do a lot of different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7056)|
| 1:57:40| and probably recruit and retain more employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7060)|
| 1:57:44| You know, the hybrid plans, like I said last time, it feels like a nice compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7064)|
| 1:57:48| but really what it is is a new defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7068)|
| 1:57:52| It puts the taxpayers at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| And according to the documents provided by the administration, we heard a lot about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7074)|
| 1:58:02| They said it's a big step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7082)|
| 1:58:05| Seventy percent, 70% of the risk is on the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7085)|
| 1:58:09| It's on the backs of the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7089)|
| 1:58:11| The vast majority of whom either have a 401K or have no retirement plan at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7091)|
| 1:58:18| Go around this city, talk to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7098)|
| 1:58:20| A lot of people have no retirement plan at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7100)|
| 1:58:23| So I think that should be taken into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7103)|
| 1:58:30| Think about the worst case scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| That's sort of what I like to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| In the worst case scenario with a defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7115)|
| 1:58:39| we have problems with retention and recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7119)|
| 1:58:43| We can fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7123)|
| 1:58:44| We can fix it immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| We can adjust salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7126)|
| 1:58:47| We can provide other benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| And we can do things that we know how much they cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7129)|
| 1:58:52| The worst case scenario for a defined contribution plan, well, we are living it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7132)|
| 1:58:59| We're experiencing right now with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7139)|
| 1:59:02| And if you want a short-term example, you don't have to look far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7142)|
| 1:59:06| Look at the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7146)|
| 1:59:07| They adopted a plan, I think it was in 2006 or 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7147)|
| 1:59:11| Look where they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| If you adopt a hybrid plan, we could be back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7153)|
| 1:59:17| I hope not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7157)|
| 1:59:18| I hope the market does well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7158)|
| 1:59:19| But we could be back here fixing a broken plan very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7159)|
| 1:59:24| And we've already had these discussions about Blackwell and current employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7164)|
| 1:59:28| We know that once you adopt a defined benefit plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7168)|
| 1:59:31| you're locking employees in for their tenure and for life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7171)|
| 1:59:35| It is a debt that lasts for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7175)|
| 1:59:40| A defined contribution plan is paid every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7180)|
| 1:59:45| You're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7185)|
| 1:59:46| You know how much you have, and you've paid it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| So think about those two worst case scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| And, again, if the market does well on a defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7192)|
| 1:59:56| the employees are going to have the benefit of that upswing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7196)|
| 1:59:59| So in either scenario, if the market does well, you know, really, that everyone benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7199)|
| 2:00:08| So think about the experience this community has had with these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7208)|
| 2:00:14| We've got a broken plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7214)|
| 2:00:15| It seems like everyone here is in agreement that our plan is broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7215)|
| 2:00:20| I think everyone's in agreement that the county's plan is broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7220)|
| 2:00:25| We really want to ask the community to accept another defined benefit plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7225)|
| 2:00:31| given their experience that we've gone through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7231)|
| 2:00:36| And I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| And, to me, it's just that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| We've got a big unfunded liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7240)|
| 2:00:42| We're going to be putting in $10 million of the rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7242)|
| 2:00:47| The projections are $20 million to $30 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7247)|
| 2:00:51| We're looking probably at tax increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7251)|
| 2:00:54| Now, when we go to the taxpayers for tax increases to pay for pensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7254)|
| 2:00:59| I, for one, want to be able to say, we solved the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| I don't want to be able to say, I'm not going to feel good about saying, we solved the problem 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7263)|
| 2:01:09| I want to be able to say, we solved the problem 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| The plan we put in today will never do this to the city again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7272)|
| 2:01:16| And you can't say that with a defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7276)|
| 2:01:20| These charts and graphs, there are so many assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| You assume how much someone is going to make in their employment, how long they're going to work for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7283)|
| 2:01:29| how long they're going to live, how long their beneficiaries are going to live, what the stock market is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7289)|
| 2:01:36| I mean, just think about all those assumptions, and just think about how wrong they all are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7296)|
| 2:01:43| That's what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7303)|
| 2:01:46| That's the main thing is to me is that we know this plan is broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7306)|
| 2:01:50| I don't think a 30% fix is the right answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7310)|
| 2:01:54| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7314)|
| 2:01:56| Sorry, that's an older line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7316)|
| 2:02:01| Here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7321)|
| 2:02:05| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7325)|
| 2:02:07| I think we're probably to that point to where we think that would be a reasonable request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7327)|
| 2:02:13| Do you want to put that in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7333)|
| 2:02:23| I think each of us can express our positions in terms of where we are right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7343)|
| 2:02:27| so that not only we as a group know where we're going, but also the administration will know in terms of what the direction is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7347)|
| 2:02:34| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| So, well, I mean, I think that the obvious question to me is a hybrid plan, whatever that plan ends up being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7355)|
| 2:02:45| I mean, we have lots of them as opposed to the defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7365)|
| 2:02:50| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7370)|
| 2:02:51| Yeah, and then we have another meeting scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| Yes, sir, next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7373)|
| 2:02:54| Next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7374)|
| 2:02:55| Yeah, at some point we need to come down somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| I'm sure that we give the administration time to prepare whatever so we can work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7380)|
| 2:03:04| I think we're getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7384)|
| 2:03:05| I think we're getting close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7385)|
| 2:03:07| So, I mean, is that a fair, Councilman Campbell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7387)|
| 2:03:13| Is it a fair what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| Well, is that a fair assumption that we would take a straw poll based on a hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7395)|
| 2:03:21| whatever that plan may be, as opposed to a defined contribution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7401)|
| 2:03:26| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| I mean, I think both of those still offer question marks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| I mean, whether the hybrid plan has this, this, or this, or the defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7411)|
| 2:03:36| I mean, I'm on the fence still as far as what's the best route to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7416)|
| 2:03:40| So we can do a straw poll, but, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7420)|
| 2:03:43| That's what you have to say is you're on the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| You can always pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7425)|
| 2:03:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7426)|
| 2:03:47| I think I just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| I just want to make sure that you all feel that that's a fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7429)|
| 2:03:53| What is the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| Are you in favor of a defined contribution plan, or are you in favor of a hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7435)|
| 2:04:00| regardless of its makeup, which was going to be tweaked in later events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7440)|
| 2:04:05| I mean, it's an informal poll, but I think it helps us work the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7445)|
| 2:04:11| I mean, we can't just keep meeting, meeting, meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7451)|
| 2:04:17| Councilman Walz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7457)|
| 2:04:18| I'm in favor of a hybrid plan, but I'm not in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| I'm not in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7462)|
| 2:04:23| I mean, I would vote against a hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| The really key essentials is how much control we can maintain right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7466)|
| 2:04:30| If you vote for a hybrid plan, if you put a hybrid plan out there that gives all the control back to the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7470)|
| 2:04:34| I'm going to vote against it in favor of a defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7474)|
| 2:04:37| No question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| I mean, there's no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| I mean, it's 70 percent risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7481)|
| 2:04:44| I think some of the qualifiers we can put on it can lower that risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7484)|
| 2:04:48| I think 70 is too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| But we can put in it to where, you know, we can decide what we are comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7490)|
| 2:04:56| He's comfortable with zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7496)|
| 2:04:57| I'm comfortable with probably 50 percent risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7497)|
| 2:05:00| So, I mean, if we can do that, yes, I'm in favor of a hybrid plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| but there's still a lot of details to work out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7504)|
| 2:05:06| Well, and that's my whole point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7506)|
| 2:05:08| It's a hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7508)|
| 2:05:10| To me, maybe it's too simple, but the defined contribution is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7510)|
| 2:05:15| I mean, I don't know that there's – I mean, you can mess with some percentages there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7515)|
| 2:05:20| but I don't think there's as many moving parts, if you will, obviously, to that as opposed to what you presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7520)|
| 2:05:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7526)|
| 2:05:27| Well, they've got – yeah, but how much the city's going to match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| I mean, that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| But there's still less, a lot less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7530)|
| 2:05:32| There is less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7532)|
| 2:05:33| I will say this, since you asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7533)|
| 2:05:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7537)|
| 2:05:38| That's my lie telling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7538)|
| 2:05:43| I forgot what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| But defined contribution, it still has some risk in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7545)|
| 2:05:51| I mean, you know what's – you know what you're going to contribute, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7551)|
| 2:05:55| But you're going to put employees across the table or in the same car together that are on different plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7555)|
| 2:06:01| So we're going to come for – the mayor's going to come back one year and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| well, I want to give a raise to our employees three percent across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| It's like, well, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7567)|
| 2:06:08| We've got these people over here on defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7568)|
| 2:06:11| So we're going to give them more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| And I think you create these levels when your forces – you only have 1,500 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7573)|
| 2:06:18| It's not that big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7578)|
| 2:06:20| In terms of private sector, it's not that big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7580)|
| 2:06:22| I mean, I don't think you want – the management of that is the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7582)|
| 2:06:27| And you can say we don't know what the recruiting is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7587)|
| 2:06:30| And I agree that that is an intangible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7590)|
| 2:06:33| And it's also an intangible what it does to your forces and how you manage through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7593)|
| 2:06:37| and how you're asking the management team, the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7597)|
| 2:06:40| to manage different employees sitting at the same table on different plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7600)|
| 2:06:44| I think that is very, very difficult to do, and it's very difficult to manage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7604)|
| 2:06:48| So that's an unintended consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| Not only does it reach the taxpayer, it reaches the taxpayer in other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7611)|
| 2:06:54| It reaches the taxpayer in job performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7614)|
| 2:06:56| So you've got to be really careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| You don't have that in your own businesses where you have a bunch of different plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7618)|
| 2:07:02| for different people that are doing the same job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7622)|
| 2:07:04| So I think that's something you've got to be careful about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7624)|
| 2:07:06| And I think Councilwoman Palmer brought that point very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7626)|
| 2:07:09| We've got – if you want to do the defined contribution, then you've got to look at –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7629)|
| 2:07:14| you know, you've got somebody that is a captain in the fire department that's somebody –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7634)|
| 2:07:19| a new hire that could be just about equal to a captain's pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7639)|
| 2:07:23| You know, so, I mean, it is a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7643)|
| 2:07:25| It is hard to manage, but that's what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7645)|
| 2:07:28| And so we've got a pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| I guess we've got a contingency on a lot of – you favor a hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7650)|
| 2:07:36| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7656)|
| 2:07:37| I favor a hybrid, but, you know, with some controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7657)|
| 2:07:41| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7661)|
| 2:07:42| If we have our – I just want to get clarity on our straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7662)|
| 2:07:46| That is a non-binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7666)|
| 2:07:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7667)|
| 2:07:48| That can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7668)|
| 2:07:49| There's nothing to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| But I want to ask you, we will be having another workshop next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7671)|
| 2:07:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| Do you anticipate or do we anticipate any more workshops after next Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7677)|
| 2:08:05| Let me just throw that out for discussion while we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7685)|
| 2:08:09| I think everything we're doing right now is based on uncharted waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7689)|
| 2:08:17| I mean, I would hope that we would be able to perhaps conclude next Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| but I still don't think that we're completely there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7701)|
| 2:08:25| I think we're getting there, but it's getting closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7705)|
| 2:08:28| We do have – if we get something on the ballot by November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7708)|
| 2:08:34| then we would need to conclude the workshops by when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7714)|
| 2:08:38| June 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7718)|
| 2:08:40| June 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7720)|
| 2:08:41| We've got to have it to the pension board by June 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7721)|
| 2:08:47| Someone said the 12th is when they meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| Yes, but we can deliver it by a month from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7729)|
| 2:08:54| The city attorney, Mr. Gilbert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7734)|
| 2:08:56| just reminded me that one other consideration you might want to think about in this decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7736)|
| 2:09:00| is to the extent you did decide to put everybody in a defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7740)|
| 2:09:05| then you might want to look at having some sort of disability coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7745)|
| 2:09:08| in addition to that that's currently provided in the DB plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7748)|
| 2:09:12| It's more than just a pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7752)|
| 2:09:13| It has a disability component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7755)|
| 2:09:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7756)|
| 2:09:17| Someone gets hurt on the job and cannot work, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7759)|
| 2:09:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7760)|
| 2:09:21| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7761)|
| 2:09:22| Oh, I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7762)|
| 2:09:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7763)|
| 2:09:24| Are we doing our straw poll now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7764)|
| 2:09:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7766)|
| 2:09:27| Oh, well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7767)|
| 2:09:28| I'm in favor of the hybrid plan that the mayor has put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7768)|
| 2:09:32| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7772)|
| 2:09:33| I'm in favor of the hybrid plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| I'm open to what Councilman Wallace has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7775)|
| 2:09:38| I'm certainly very supportive of what the mayor's office has presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7778)|
| 2:09:43| and I think that this group has shown a great deal of sensibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7783)|
| 2:09:47| and we all have some very similar concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7787)|
| 2:09:50| We're just taking different paths to get to the end zone, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7790)|
| 2:09:56| And I'll ditto that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7796)|
| 2:09:58| That's where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7798)|
| 2:10:00| Councilman DelBocchi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7800)|
| 2:10:01| Yes, well, I'm listening to my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| and I'm trying to get my head straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7803)|
| 2:10:07| Now you know how we feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| I swing back and forth because I think the idea of 70% risk on the taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7809)|
| 2:10:14| sounds way too much, and I hear Mr. Wallace saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7814)|
| 2:10:17| well, we can manage that by coming up with a hybrid with less risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| and that has some appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| The idea of a defined contribution with a known amount that you put on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7823)|
| 2:10:30| every year has some appeal, but I am concerned about low-income folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7830)|
| 2:10:35| maybe not having enough to retire on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| That troubles me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7837)|
| 2:10:38| That steers me halfway towards a hybrid, but I really do like the defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7838)|
| 2:10:44| I would say most people in the country, that's all they really have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7844)|
| 2:10:49| And people who call me say, look, I'm working today because the assets I accrued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7849)|
| 2:10:56| aren't as big as they wanted them to be, and 2008 was a disaster in everyone's book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7856)|
| 2:11:02| Unless you're Houdini, you lost money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| You probably lost money in 2001, 2002, because when the market goes down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7864)|
| 2:11:09| the boats all go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| When it goes up, the boats kind of float.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| That's what the vote is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7873)|
| 2:11:18| I will go with a defined contribution unless we come up with a hybrid of 50 percent risk or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7878)|
| 2:11:25| something that cuts the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7887)|
| 2:11:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7888)|
| 2:11:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7889)|
| 2:11:30| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7890)|
| 2:11:31| Yes, I'm in favor of a defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| Defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7894)|
| 2:11:35| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7895)|
| 2:11:36| Defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7896)|
| 2:11:38| So at the next meeting, what will be the council's pleasure to ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7898)|
| 2:11:42| Why don't you give them Mark Campin's e-mail address, and that will solve this whole problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7902)|
| 2:11:48| That's not funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7908)|
| 2:11:52| I think, Mayor, I think that when we talk about a defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7912)|
| 2:11:57| I think that maybe what maybe the administration, I realize they've come to us with a hybrid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7917)|
| 2:12:02| but maybe they can take into consideration that some of us are concerned about their hybrid plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7922)|
| 2:12:07| and that they could come to us with some kind of a makeup of a defined contribution plan that does take into effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7927)|
| 2:12:14| you know, the disability and things like this that you talked about that we would certainly want our employees to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7934)|
| 2:12:20| And, again, I think that, as my colleagues have said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7940)|
| 2:12:26| we are taking care of the existing employees and those that are coming in by a certain date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7946)|
| 2:12:31| and what we're looking for is to the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7951)|
| 2:12:34| And then, George, I think also we still have not solved the major bleeding problem that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7954)|
| 2:12:38| It's something that we have to ---- that's a whole separate issue that we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7958)|
| 2:12:42| But I move we adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7962)|
| 2:12:44| Well, we've got to figure out what we're doing next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7964)|
| 2:12:48| Oh, I thought we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7968)|
| 2:12:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7969)|
| 2:12:51| So what are we going to do Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7971)|
| 2:12:52| That was your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7972)|
| 2:12:53| Yeah, that's the real question on the table now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7973)|
| 2:12:58| I mean, we've still got a lot of moving parts there that I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7978)|
| 2:13:03| I guess we can have further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7983)|
| 2:13:05| Well, that concept of de-risking that Alan mentioned is an important one, and it fits in with what Mr. Wallace said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7985)|
| 2:13:12| And he makes a great point, I think, about some of the levers in whatever hybrid you come up with ought to be kept as a discretionary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=7992)|
| 2:13:25| matter because if you're in a bad situation, you may not be able to do as much cost of living or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8005)|
| 2:13:32| And that's where the risk really is coming from right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8012)|
| 2:13:36| There are lots of things happening, and we can't afford them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8016)|
| 2:13:40| And we don't want to put the next council and the next council and the next council there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8020)|
| 2:13:45| So they'll get to make decisions based on what the numbers look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| I mean, you've got to be rational about this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8028)|
| 2:13:51| We're going to run that line on that plan right there, and I'm hoping that it's going to get down to 50 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8031)|
| 2:13:57| Let me recognize Mr. Pennington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8037)|
| 2:14:01| There's really two ways, I think, that risk is created in the retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8041)|
| 2:14:07| One of the risks has to do directly with how the assets are invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8047)|
| 2:14:13| If the assets are invested relatively more conservatively, then there's less risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8053)|
| 2:14:18| If they're invested more aggressively, there's more risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8058)|
| 2:14:21| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8061)|
| 2:14:22| To the extent inactive liability was, let's call it immunized, sort of as if you had purchased annuities, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8062)|
| 2:14:32| that kind of takes that risk off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8072)|
| 2:14:34| If that had been done all along, we wouldn't be having this discussion today because we wouldn't be in the position that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8074)|
| 2:14:40| The other piece of risk is how is it shared between the city and between the employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8080)|
| 2:14:46| Because right now, on the whole, the city is taking all the risks in the defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8086)|
| 2:14:51| Under the hybrid, there is some sharing of that risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8091)|
| 2:14:57| What I wanted to point out is that at least the way the rules are right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8097)|
| 2:15:02| it's beyond the purview of the council to dictate how the assets are invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8102)|
| 2:15:08| And yet, one of the key concerns is, if you have a hybrid plan, how is the risk going to be split?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8108)|
| 2:15:16| But how much risk is there going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8116)|
| 2:15:19| So to the extent you come back and say, well, we could accept a hybrid if, with respect to the inactive liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8119)|
| 2:15:27| we knew it was going to be handled at least within these broad parameters to limit the total amount of risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8127)|
| 2:15:35| that might do just as much or more as whether you're tweaking the $40,000 to $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8135)|
| 2:15:42| I mean, that changes the risk profile a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8142)|
| 2:15:46| But a lot of the risk is the employees retire from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8146)|
| 2:15:49| They take a lifetime annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| All those retirees now have assets that are in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8151)|
| 2:15:54| So however you split the risk while they're active, a good amount of that risk is after they retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8154)|
| 2:16:00| And that's not really affected by that $40,000, $20,000, wherever you set that break point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8160)|
| 2:16:06| That's really more dictated by how are those assets going to be invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8166)|
| 2:16:11| Can I follow up on what he just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8171)|
| 2:16:13| Because, actually, Alan's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8173)|
| 2:16:17| That configuration is done by the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8177)|
| 2:16:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8181)|
| 2:16:22| And that's really not under our purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8182)|
| 2:16:23| I think at some point, quite frankly, we need to have a conversation about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8183)|
| 2:16:27| I think that wouldn't be necessarily a productive time for us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8187)|
| 2:16:31| Hey, Councilman Gray, real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8191)|
| 2:16:33| I was just going to say that you were asking what to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8193)|
| 2:16:36| Again, I go back to say that let's look at a defined contribution plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8196)|
| 2:16:41| and see what it does look like, different parts and pieces, and have them put that together, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8201)|
| 2:16:47| You know, is that enough time for you all to be able to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8207)|
| 2:16:53| It has the disability component, I guess, if nothing else, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8213)|
| 2:17:00| What additional information are you asking for beyond what you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8220)|
| 2:17:06| Whether or not we can have a plan, an example of a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8226)|
| 2:17:11| You've got the 457, obviously, but you don't have the disability part has to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8231)|
| 2:17:20| Well, as I hear it then, the disability part of it and what else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8240)|
| 2:17:27| He's saying the percentages that you would put in the pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8247)|
| 2:17:30| In other words, do you match at 6 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8250)|
| 2:17:32| Do you do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8252)|
| 2:17:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8253)|
| 2:17:34| John Sparrow said that you can put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8254)|
| 2:17:35| You have to put a certain amount in, but you can put in more and they'll match up to a higher number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8255)|
| 2:17:39| I mean, there was all those aspects you were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8259)|
| 2:17:42| What numbers would we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8262)|
| 2:17:45| So you just want to cross the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| I mean, like a, I don't know, 10 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8267)|
| 2:17:50| I mean, I've got to give them direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8270)|
| 2:17:53| In the defined contribution plan, if you say we're going to put in 8 percent and the cost is 8 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8273)|
| 2:17:57| and it's 8 percent of payroll, so, I mean, I can take the projected payroll and apply the payroll to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8277)|
| 2:18:02| But, I mean, what you've got in these projections, or maybe you don't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8282)|
| 2:18:06| but these projections that we were just looking at that Dr. Lyons was showing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8286)|
| 2:18:12| the blue line on there is an 8 percent of payroll defined contribution for the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8292)|
| 2:18:18| city government employees, and a 10 percent for the fire and police employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8298)|
| 2:18:22| So it averages out around 9 percent of payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8302)|
| 2:18:25| So if that's 9 percent, it's not, you know, if you're 8 percent, it goes down a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8305)|
| 2:18:30| You know, it's not a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8310)|
| 2:18:32| I mean, it's going to be a sort of interpolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8312)|
| 2:18:35| If you double it, it goes up twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8315)|
| 2:18:36| If you half it, it goes in half or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8316)|
| 2:18:39| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8319)|
| 2:18:41| If you had vesting schedules and a match component, does that, that would change it, would it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8321)|
| 2:18:48| Well, if it was a, are you talking about having voluntary contributions instead of mandatory contributions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8328)|
| 2:18:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8333)|
| 2:18:54| Because, I mean, I'm actually personally in favor of if we had a defined contribution plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8334)|
| 2:18:59| all the risk is on the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8339)|
| 2:19:00| I don't think it should be mandatory that they contribute to a plan that the risk is on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8340)|
| 2:19:06| So I would say there would be no, and, you know, if I had my own way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8346)|
| 2:19:09| that there would be no mandatory contribution for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8349)|
| 2:19:12| They, you know, I mean, just hypothetically, let's say that there was an 8 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8352)|
| 2:19:18| up to an 8 percent match and people could contribute up to 15 percent or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8358)|
| 2:19:22| but the city would only contribute up to 8 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8362)|
| 2:19:24| And then you hypothesize that, on average, 50 percent of the population would do the entire contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8364)|
| 2:19:32| So now you're looking at a 4 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8372)|
| 2:19:34| I mean, some people might do 6, some people might do 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8374)|
| 2:19:37| But let's say it averaged 4 or 5 percent, then you'd be looking at about half of that blue line that's on this page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8377)|
| 2:19:46| Now, you know, if you either want to give me some directions on the specifics of that, you know, I can rerun that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8386)|
| 2:19:54| But it's pretty much the vesting schedule isn't going to make a big, big difference in terms of the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8394)|
| 2:20:01| because the employees are getting all their money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8401)|
| 2:20:04| They're not getting the city money for those first 5 or 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8404)|
| 2:20:08| But, frankly, in the defined contribution projections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8408)|
| 2:20:11| I've just been applying 8 percent and 10 percent of the payroll and not factoring in the vesting schedule directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8411)|
| 2:20:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8418)|
| 2:20:19| I'm going to cut discussion off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8419)|
| 2:20:20| I mean, we've got to thank you so much, I mean, everybody, for the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8420)|
| 2:20:25| I've been trying to keep these to two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| We've still got some people to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| We've got a meeting coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8429)|
| 2:20:32| I'll sleep on it and, you know, think about what you've just got to keep in mind we've got from now until Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8432)|
| 2:20:38| for, you know, if there's going to be a major change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8438)|
| 2:20:42| or other asks that we need to be considerate of, you know, time schedules there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8442)|
| 2:20:48| Yeah, if I could say one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8448)|
| 2:20:50| I think we have two things we want to look at Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8450)|
| 2:20:52| One is this idea of how do you control the risk allocation because that matters, I think, to some folks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8452)|
| 2:20:58| The other is if there's some flexibility on costing out scenarios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8458)|
| 2:21:03| and I don't know how much time or computer time that takes, whether that can be done somewhat on the fly or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8463)|
| 2:21:10| I don't know if, for example, Alan could have three or four lines with different assumptions on one or two of those or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8470)|
| 2:21:17| just so that we can talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| But money is going to matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8479)|
| 2:21:20| The money is going to matter to this panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8480)|
| 2:21:22| I think Dr. Lyons can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8482)|
| 2:21:24| Well, we want to provide you with the information you need to make your decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8484)|
| 2:21:28| including variations that you asked about the D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8488)|
| 2:21:31| I mean, so I think Mr. Pennington said he will make himself available if you want to communicate some questions such as has come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8491)|
| 2:21:38| And I'll let you speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120503?start=8498)|
