| 0:16:57| tell us your story, what happened? Well, number one, I'm appalled that I'm back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| here, so much so that I made a couple telephone calls before this event. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| talked to Mrs. Hill about the events and how they happened and we're appalled at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1026)|
| 0:17:15| what happened. As I stood before you the last time, I talked to you about us being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| a responsible vendor, about all the training that we do. I brought all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| documentation again if you want to see it. We do adhere to the training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| that the state of Tennessee requires. We even go up and above and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| beyond that with monthly meetings, daily meetings, and I've got all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| documentation here. And as I said before, it's a willful decision by employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| that just don't care and that's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| Number two. Let me just stop you for a second. So you say you've been certified by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| state as a responsible vendor? Correct. All right, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| All right, so number two. We have reorganized our management structure, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1076)|
| 0:18:04| you will. The manager that was at that store is no longer at that store. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| put one of our district managers in that store who is a training manager, so just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| that step alone should help. Number two. I think I can't see the name, but he said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| this system should be idiot proof, and you're exactly right. We scan every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1100)|

| 0:18:33| for whatever reason a cell of alcohol is not scanned, we have a log now, we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| started this after this event, that every cell of alcohol has to be put into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| log. There will be no sale of alcohol at this location unless that ID is scanned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1122)|

| 0:18:50| To the beer board, I'd like to point out we don't get many of these, but there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1130)|
| 0:18:59| a section regarding responsible vendors and it limits the penalty to $1,000 per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1139)|
| 0:19:06| offense when they're a responsible vendor. Their license cannot be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| revoked unless they have two offenses within a 12-month period and the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| has revoked their responsible vendor certificate. So in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| particular case, since he's a responsible vendor, since I assume the state has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| revoked your responsible vendor status, any punishment in this case is limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1164)|

| 0:19:34| questions? Commissioner Schoenmaker. Thank you, Madam Chair. So, Mr. Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1174)|
| 0:19:41| Director, they've had two offenses in the last, what was it, 62 or 65 days? Within two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1181)|
| 0:19:49| months we had two events. So it's not been more than 12 months? No, it hasn't been. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1189)|
| 0:19:56| less than? It's two violations within a 12-month period and then only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| after the State Alcoholic Beverage Commission revokes the permittee status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| as a responsible vendor. So those two steps have to happen before you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| consider revocation of this license. Okay, so how does the Alcohol Beverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1210)|
| 0:20:18| Commission revoke a license then in this case? Do they have to be reported because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| of this incident? I would assume so. I've never had any dealings with that, so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| don't know, but I presume if they became aware of it and felt it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1226)|
| 0:20:33| egregious enough, they would consider that. Okay. Well, and your company has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| always been first-class on everything that they do, and I know you're very, very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| disappointed. Very. And of course, obviously, we're disappointed because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| it's a back-to-back offense, basically. So, but we'll follow what the rules are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1247)|

| 0:21:11| fined before for these previous incidences, so it's just $1,000 for each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1271)|
| 0:21:18| offense as it comes up. So you're limited today to $1,000 based on the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1278)|

| 0:23:26| it, last time I was here, I was very, very frustrated because it was a willful decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| by an employee that wasn't as invested in our business as we were. Because we do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1410)|
| 0:23:37| right training, and we can prove that we do the right training, this kind of protects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| me a little bit because we are doing the right training. Who's at fault here? Yes, Ken Jo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1423)|

| 0:23:56| was in there. And we didn't train her to do that. We trained her to scan it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1436)|
| 0:24:03| Well, I appreciate that you haven't done extra effort and gone through it. It's just an interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| we haven't had this before, and I haven't seen this in six years, so this is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| pretty interesting. Maybe it does help long-term, but I think every employer is always at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1450)|
| 0:24:17| risk of an employee doing something really stupid, no matter what it is, whether it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| a beer permit, or a health violation in the kitchen, or anything else in between. So thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1460)|

| 0:24:29| Okay, now, there we go. I'm sorry. We're having technical issues. To follow up with Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1469)|
| 0:24:40| Jay, what's the criteria to become a responsible vendor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| All of the criteria, I would hesitate to say right here, but it has to do with the training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| standards that the state has set out, and to have a program that implements that, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| teaches that, that tests that, and you pass the test, you prove that you know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| When did you become a responsible vendor? What year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1501)|
| 0:25:10| Well, the certificate that I hold here in front of me has an effective date of 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| with an expiration of 2024, but it's at least five, six years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| Okay, so this was something you kind of perceived as a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| Honestly, it really came about when we got our wine license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| Thank you. And I do want to say, although I'm sad to see you here again, that I do want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| to applaud your efforts in taking those measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| We take it seriously. I mean, it's our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| Well, that's what we hope that everyone would do, is really take it seriously. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1535)|
| 0:25:42| No other questions? I want to speak to Commissioner Frazier also, that you've been down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1542)|
| 0:25:50| but you really are taking responsibility, and we appreciate you doing the training and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| that kind of stuff, and we know it's hard right now with employees, but I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| that you reach out to your district commissioner, and we can see your frustration that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| here again, so I just, I appreciate that. With no other questions, I will turn this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| over to Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| Thank you, and I do appreciate the conversation that we had. I, too, hear your frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| I might also note to commissioners that they've had their license since 1993, so I think this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| also indicates just some changing trends we've seen collectively in the difficulty with being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1583)|
| 0:26:31| able to hire people that are as invested in your business as you wish they would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1591)|
| 0:26:38| I do applaud your effort. I think bringing in a training manager and placing them in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| that store is extraordinary, given how old that store is and how long it's been around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1603)|
| 0:26:50| She wasn't that happy, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| Well, it's what it is, you know, and you don't want to close, and quite frankly, this business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1612)|
| 0:27:02| is located in the community of Solway. There's not a lot of businesses down there, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| would not be good for the community either, although it's certainly not good that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| selling beer, but you get that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| Right, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| Anyway, following the advice of Director Moyers, you will be fined $1,000 for this third violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1636)|
| 0:27:27| and I do think I did make you aware that it takes three years for prior violations to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1647)|
| 0:27:34| roll off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| One other thing we did, I failed to mention this, we do our own beer stings internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| We tripled the frequency at that store, so just know that we did that too. I forgot about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| Oh, good to know, good to know. All right, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1664)|

| 0:30:05| to do that and get a beer permit. It's also very discouraging because the young lady sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=1805)|

| 0:34:08| Now, you said this was a military license, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2048)|

| 0:34:17| And for you, too, sir, can you explain to me why you did not, did you know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2057)|

| 0:34:36| Well, it sounded like she sold it, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2076)|

| 0:36:32| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| It's kind of ironic because we've been watching for this location to open, to reopen after the remodeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2193)|
| 0:36:40| It's been going on for months and months and months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2200)|

| 0:36:49| And I was like, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| And so I was going to give them a hard time about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| But anyways, we're just glad they're open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| I'm sorry that they're missing an opportunity for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| Hopefully they'll be here next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| On the military ID, I just Googled them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| I don't see what the date of birth is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| Where is the date of birth on the military ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| If I'm not mistaken, it's on the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| Not on the front of the ID like a normal ID would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| And then there's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| I mean, I have one, but mine's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| And I know of three different military IDs just off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| Actually, four, now that I think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| So which one of the four IDs is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| Because each one's orientated differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| I think the young man is in the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| Is it a CAC ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| I'm not sure, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| It was the other detective that went with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| Because...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| I would prefer if we do these in the future that we don't use military IDs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| because of these kind of situation, we don't even know what kind of ID it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| And it's a little uneasy for me thinking about it like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| It is issued by the government, so it's technically...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| Yeah, I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2286)|

| 0:38:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2289)|

| 0:38:16| It's a little difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| On the back, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2299)|

| 0:38:21| You have a dependent ID, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| Which is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2303)|

| 0:38:25| But they're different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| Each one's different because I don't think mine has it on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| But I'll check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| I guess it's per branch, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2310)|

| 0:38:57| They're all...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| There's like five, four at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240221-beer-board?start=2339)|
