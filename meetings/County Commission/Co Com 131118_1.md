| 2:55:51| I also want to point out that what's listed on my expense account doesn't even cover everything that I've gone to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10551)|
| 2:55:58| on my own time and on my own dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10558)|
| 2:56:01| I also would like to point out that whenever possible, I've carpooled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10561)|
| 2:56:04| I have applied for scholarships and grants to attend conferences to keep the cost down as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10564)|
| 2:56:13| Same thing with the economic summit on women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10573)|
| 2:56:15| It's always on the fourth Monday of every October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10575)|
| 2:56:19| It always coincides with this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10579)|
| 2:56:21| I always register, and half the time I've had to cancel because there's been something here on the agenda that's needed my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10581)|
| 2:56:29| So I've never missed something where I was going to be an important vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10589)|
| 2:56:34| And anyone who thinks that the only part of being a commissioner is sitting here in the seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10594)|
| 2:56:39| I would say is probably not doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10599)|
| 2:56:42| One thing I do want to point out about the 2012 FY is that I do have, Larry, some travel for you, $418.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10602)|
| 2:56:51| Point of order, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10611)|
| 2:56:53| We've killed this dog enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10613)|
| 2:56:55| Let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10615)|
| 2:56:56| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10616)|
| 2:56:57| He has made this is the end of it, but he has made he directed his comments toward her, and I'm going to let her respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10617)|
| 2:57:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10623)|
| 2:57:06| In 2012, you took two round trip trips, round trip driving trips one day to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10626)|
| 2:57:15| and charged the county $416 for driving there and back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10635)|
| 2:57:21| Hey, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10641)|
| 2:57:25| Yeah, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10645)|
| 2:57:26| Now, we're done making accusations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10646)|
| 2:57:28| We get the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10648)|
| 2:57:30| I just turned in the travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10650)|
| 2:57:32| Mr. Smith, we're done with travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10652)|
| 2:57:36| We're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10656)|
| 2:57:38| No, just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10658)|
| 2:57:40| In regards to going to Nashville, myself and the mayor went to Nashville earlier last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10660)|
| 2:57:49| to discuss with the governor about the forensic center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10669)|
| 2:57:55| Chris and I experimented, and we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10675)|
| 2:57:59| There is a state contract for enterprise rental car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10679)|
| 2:58:02| And so we took a --there were six of us going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10682)|
| 2:58:06| We would have taken two cars round trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10686)|
| 2:58:08| It would have been about $500 roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10688)|
| 2:58:11| We rented through Jolie, and there's a representative at Enterprise Rental Car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10691)|
| 2:58:18| We rented a car, all six of us rented actually a van, drove down and back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10698)|
| 2:58:22| With gas and rental, it was $100 for the six to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10702)|
| 2:58:25| So I would advise you to, if you are going to Nashville, a close trip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10705)|
| 2:58:31| that's probably the most economical way you can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10711)|
| 2:58:33| If you were by yourself in a mid-sized car, you could do it for $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10713)|
| 2:58:37| That's why everything should be cleared through the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10717)|
| 2:58:39| That way you can do things, can be coordinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10719)|
| 2:58:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10722)|
| 2:58:43| So, but going forward, the mayor and I have made commitments that we'll probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10723)|
| 2:58:47| during the legislative session, be down a couple of times a month in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10727)|
| 2:58:51| And you guys are more than welcome to join us if your schedule allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10731)|
| 2:58:54| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10734)|
| 2:58:56| Discussion regarding the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10736)|
| 2:58:57| Are we going to turn that over to the Rules Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10737)|
| 2:58:59| Is that where we left it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10739)|
| 2:59:00| Because I'm not going to do a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10740)|
| 2:59:01| Mike, I'll let you do that, and we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10741)|
| 2:59:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10744)|
| 2:59:05| This discussion needs to be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10745)|
| 2:59:07| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10747)|
| 2:59:08| Discussion regarding the IIA recommendation to the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10748)|
| 2:59:13| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10753)|
| 2:59:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10755)|
| 2:59:16| At the Audit Committee meeting the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10756)|
| 2:59:18| we discussed the fact that the Audit Committee is made up of five individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10758)|
| 2:59:24| three sitting commissioners appointed by commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10764)|
| 2:59:28| and two citizen members of which currently we only have one citizen member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10768)|
| 2:59:35| because of the resignation of one sitting citizen member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10775)|
| 2:59:41| And it was just what this is here for today is to see if there is any progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10781)|
| 2:59:48| in refilling the empty seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10788)|
| 2:59:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10791)|
| 2:59:52| They have sent myself and I forwarded to the law department a letter requesting some things about notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10792)|
| 2:59:59| and notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10799)|
| 3:00:00| So I think I need to have a meeting with the director of that organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10800)|
| 3:00:05| because I think there are some things that they're asking us to do that are not unnecessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10805)|
| 3:00:11| but we already do, and they just need to understand our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10811)|
| 3:00:15| Good assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10815)|
| 3:00:18| That's where we're at with that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10818)|
| 3:00:19| Let's adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10819)|
| 3:00:20| It's 4.55 or 4.54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10820)|
| 3:00:24| How long is the next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10824)|
| 3:00:27| Commissioner Rawls, can we do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10827)|
| 3:00:28| There's one more Audit Committee discussion, and it's probably going to take more than five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10828)|
| 3:00:32| We're going to adjourn until 5 o'clock for zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10832)|
| 3:01:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10862)|
| 3:01:10| It's 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10870)|
| 3:01:11| Let's call the zoning meetings to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10871)|

| 3:03:19| I'd like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=10999)|
| 3:03:20| I'd ask for one unit per acre on this zoning, and they had recommended .6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11000)|
| 3:03:24| The .6 is not going to work for me, so I would like not to have a vote on the .6 if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11004)|
| 3:03:31| I need .8 units, which would get me at least five units, which is one more unit than what was recommended by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11011)|
| 3:03:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11018)|

| 3:03:48| And so you're asking for .8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11028)|
| 3:03:52| I'm asking for .8, which would give me a little over five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11032)|
| 3:03:54| I need five total units versus four, which is what MPC had recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11034)|
| 3:04:00| It's seven acres, so I'm looking to put five total units on the seven acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11040)|
| 3:04:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11045)|

| 3:04:12| Yeah, the .6 resulted from our staff analysis of the slope on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11052)|
| 3:04:20| It does have some steep topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11060)|
| 3:04:22| It's got a flat part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11062)|
| 3:04:24| The flat part is more on the southern part of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11064)|
| 3:04:27| but this is right at the edge of where the property goes down to Melton Hill Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11067)|
| 3:04:33| And, you know, it's essentially pretty much kind of a cliff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11073)|
| 3:04:39| The staff recommended .6, which would allow him, under plan residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11079)|
| 3:04:44| to give us a plan right at four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11084)|
| 3:04:50| The five units would be, as he's mentioned, be right at .8 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11090)|
| 3:04:55| We felt like the one dwelling unit per acre, even though this is in a rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11095)|
| 3:05:01| that was we felt like it was really not consistent with the pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11101)|
| 3:05:05| If you look at your map, you see the lots in front of the subject property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11105)|
| 3:05:09| that are actually in front of West Gallagher Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11109)|
| 3:05:12| Those are much larger lots than what could be accommodated at the full one unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11112)|
| 3:05:19| which would be seven dwellings on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11119)|
| 3:05:21| So MPC followed staff recommendation at .6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11121)|
| 3:05:26| Again, it was based on the analysis of the slope constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11126)|
| 3:05:33| And it's four units, five units, or essentially seven units, pretty much your choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11133)|
| 3:05:42| Has there a site plan yet been turned in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11142)|
| 3:05:46| If you'll allow me, I think he was looking at different strategies on how to develop the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11146)|
| 3:05:52| He has turned in a plat that is to be on or was scheduled to be on our December agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11152)|
| 3:05:59| at developing five lots under the agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11159)|
| 3:06:03| Each of the lots has over an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11163)|
| 3:06:05| plus you have what would be an easement connecting Gallagher Ferry to the five lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11165)|
| 3:06:14| But that would be under the agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11174)|
| 3:06:17| And pretty much the entire site would be taken up, potentially can be taken up by development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11177)|
| 3:06:24| to be going to the edge of what I refer to as the very steep back part of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11184)|
| 3:06:30| So I don't want to speak for Rusty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11190)|
| 3:06:32| I think he indicated to me he would prefer planned residential zoning at some density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11192)|
| 3:06:39| He mentioned five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11199)|
| 3:06:41| So I think he was just trying to make sure he had options there that he could choose from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11201)|
| 3:06:47| in terms of development of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11207)|
| 3:06:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11210)|
| 3:06:51| I guess if I could say, obviously from the plat that we've turned in for the December meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11211)|
| 3:06:55| I can get my five units under ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11215)|
| 3:06:57| What it's going to do is push me to build on the slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11217)|
| 3:07:00| If I can get the PR five units, it allows me to stay on the flat spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11220)|
| 3:07:04| because the setbacks are reduced and obviously the lot size is reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11224)|
| 3:07:07| So I think it's beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11227)|
| 3:07:09| If the county's stand is to keep us off the slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11229)|
| 3:07:12| the PR will keep me off the slopes and help me on my setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11232)|
| 3:07:17| So I think it's advantageous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11237)|
| 3:07:19| I don't know if that agrees or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11239)|
| 3:07:23| Does the MPC, I mean, is there going to be a big difference in the .6 and the .8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11243)|
| 3:07:29| I mean, I know it's MPC staffs going by guidelines that they have to follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11249)|
| 3:07:33| but if we don't, he can go and do it on ag and kill the slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11253)|
| 3:07:38| I don't know what my boss who's sitting to my right is going to shake his head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11258)|
| 3:07:43| I would think it's not that much of a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11263)|
| 3:07:47| You know, it's closer to the four units that we recommended for the site versus seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11267)|
| 3:07:53| And as the primary thing, we still have the plan residential where we can work with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11273)|
| 3:07:59| to figure out the best place to locate those units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11279)|
| 3:08:03| Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11283)|
| 3:08:04| The staff recommendation was guided, on one hand, by the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11284)|
| 3:08:09| and ridgetop recommendations, but also by the lot pattern of those adjacent lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11289)|
| 3:08:14| There just so happened to be four lots that go across that southern boundary of his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11294)|
| 3:08:23| So that's how we got to roughly four units on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11303)|
| 3:08:27| So the .6 gives him four units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11307)|
| 3:08:29| The .8 gives him five units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11309)|
| 3:08:31| So, you know, it's not a big impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11311)|
| 3:08:34| And, frankly, the planned residential gives him the flexibility to minimize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11314)|
| 3:08:39| And it gives you the flexibility to approve the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11319)|
| 3:08:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11321)|
| 3:08:42| I move the motion that we approve the .8 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11322)|
| 3:08:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11326)|
| 3:08:48| What is the condition that's in there, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11328)|
| 3:08:51| What's the condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11331)|
| 3:08:52| Our standard condition is that there be no disturbance to the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11332)|
| 3:08:56| until there's been a development plan approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11336)|
| 3:08:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11338)|
| 3:08:59| I want to go with .8 with the same condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11339)|
| 3:09:02| And I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11342)|
| 3:09:04| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11344)|
| 3:09:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11345)|
| 3:09:06| So what we have before us in the package shows four lots with two behind it up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11346)|
| 3:09:18| Now, what you have in the package in terms of what MPC recommended would result in that property having four units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11358)|
| 3:09:29| They could be lots, but four units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11369)|
| 3:09:31| Well, I see something that really has, like, seven units on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11371)|
| 3:09:35| That's his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11375)|
| 3:09:36| That's his request at one dwelling unit per acre, under ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11376)|
| 3:09:41| But what we're voting on now is it's going to be planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11381)|
| 3:09:45| He's going to spot five houses, and you all have to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11385)|
| 3:09:50| And it's going to be off the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11390)|
| 3:09:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11392)|
| 3:09:53| And it's going to be off the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11393)|
| 3:09:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11394)|
| 3:09:58| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11398)|
| 3:10:01| The motion on the floor is .8 with .8 dwelling units per acre with the condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11401)|
| 3:10:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11408)|

| 3:11:03| Discussion regarding the Audit Committee and Criminal Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11463)|
| 3:11:09| I guess we need to adjourn the zonings and then we'll go back to the discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11469)|
| 3:11:20| We don't have to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11480)|
| 3:11:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11481)|
| 3:11:23| Any discussion on the audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11483)|
| 3:11:27| I think it was the Criminal Court Clerk's Office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11487)|
| 3:11:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11489)|
| 3:11:30| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11490)|
| 3:11:33| Unfortunately, I don't remember all the details on our three options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11493)|
| 3:11:38| so I'm going to be counting on Ed and Dave to help me with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11498)|
| 3:11:42| We talked about three different possibilities of looking into what's been going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11502)|
| 3:11:49| with the Criminal Court Clerk's Office and decided that we needed to bring it before the full commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11509)|
| 3:11:56| and see if there was consensus on how they would like us to proceed once we have a new internal auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11516)|
| 3:12:02| which today we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11522)|
| 3:12:04| So I imagine this will be one of the first things that we ask her to look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11524)|
| 3:12:09| Ed and Dave, you all are going to need to help me out with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11529)|
| 3:12:13| I know that one of them was an audit of strictly financials within the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11533)|
| 3:12:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11542)|
| 3:12:23| Fees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11543)|
| 3:12:25| One that dealt with the procedures on how communications are made between the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11545)|
| 3:12:38| and the clerk's office and the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11558)|
| 3:12:41| and where are there problems there, trying to get to the bottom of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11561)|
| 3:12:47| And the third one, and is David Buch here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11567)|
| 3:12:52| So, David, I hate to put you on the spot, but you were there for that discussion as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11572)|
| 3:12:56| And one of them had more of a legal edge to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11576)|
| 3:13:02| So, Ed, you've got your light on, so I'm going to let you take over, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11582)|
| 3:13:06| I would suggest that we look at, again, recall, we don't have any authority over this office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11586)|
| 3:13:15| but people would be very reluctant to say, no, I don't want an audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11595)|
| 3:13:20| because then it looks like, why don't they want an audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11600)|
| 3:13:24| So I don't think that will be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11604)|
| 3:13:26| But I would suggest we have some type of a operations paper flow data processing type audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11606)|
| 3:13:36| and I'll throw the data processing computerization phrase in there, and that might enable this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11616)|
| 3:13:43| I don't want to put my hands in money that I shouldn't be having my hands in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11623)|
| 3:13:48| but that $130,000 plus that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11628)|
| 3:13:51| The technology fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11631)|
| 3:13:52| The technology fee, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11632)|
| 3:13:54| It appears there may be a technology problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11634)|
| 3:13:57| I'm not an auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11637)|
| 3:13:58| I'm not an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11638)|
| 3:13:59| I don't know what the problems are, but it appears to be a paper flow problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11639)|
| 3:14:05| Here, a cash flow problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11645)|
| 3:14:06| This appears to be a paper flow problem and a lack of computerization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11646)|
| 3:14:11| And by putting that, calling it a technology audit or a data processing audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11651)|
| 3:14:15| I would speculate that those funds could be used for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11655)|
| 3:14:20| Obviously, Ms. McCroskey, I think it's at her discretion how those dollars are spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11660)|
| 3:14:26| and so she would need to cooperate with that, and I haven't had discussion with her on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11666)|
| 3:14:33| so I'm sort of just shooting from the hip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11673)|
| 3:14:35| And I think that would be a good idea to explore something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11675)|
| 3:14:39| and it looks like there would be a source of funding for it, and it would be a specialized audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11679)|
| 3:14:46| I doubt the lady we hired today would be qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11686)|
| 3:14:51| I doubt pewing companies qualified for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11691)|
| 3:14:53| I think that they would be able to recommend someone that would have the background to do something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11693)|
| 3:14:59| Or the lady may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11699)|
| 3:15:00| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11700)|
| 3:15:01| There is a company that did a previous audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11701)|
| 3:15:07| or consulted for the county in the earlier mid-90s that dealt with the justice system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11707)|
| 3:15:16| and efficiencies or lack of efficiencies in the justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11716)|
| 3:15:20| But I think that that would be something that we would probably consult with that type of company again to discuss that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11720)|
| 3:15:27| and to see if there's anything that they see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11727)|
| 3:15:29| Because I think they do criminal courts in state and local governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11729)|
| 3:15:35| and so that may be something that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11735)|
| 3:15:37| But the new auditor won't start for at least four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11737)|
| 3:15:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11740)|
| 3:15:42| I think we'll find out the best practice on that and then try to move forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11742)|
| 3:15:48| It may even be called an efficiency audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11748)|
| 3:15:50| I mean, there's different ways we can call it what we want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11750)|
| 3:15:53| but the important thing is to get a different set of eyes in there that are experts on moving this paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11753)|
| 3:15:59| and getting it into the what's the acronym, JAMIS or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11759)|
| 3:16:03| JEMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11763)|
| 3:16:04| JEMS, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11764)|
| 3:16:05| Justice Information Management System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11765)|
| 3:16:07| And so these SNFUs that we keep reading about are stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11767)|
| 3:16:13| I agree, and I think calling it an efficiency audit is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11773)|
| 3:16:18| And, Brad, your suggestion, that's I think exactly the kind of group we would need to consult with on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11778)|
| 3:16:25| because my concern is not so much about the dollars and cents in the office but the flow of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11785)|
| 3:16:33| If one person is in jail one day longer than they need to be, then that's a disgrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11793)|
| 3:16:39| I don't think there's a – the dollars have disappeared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11799)|
| 3:16:42| I don't think that's an issue at all like maybe trustee years ago or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11802)|
| 3:16:48| But I think it's just – I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11808)|
| 3:16:50| The biggest tragedy is someone being incarcerated unjustly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11810)|
| 3:16:54| And then, secondly, we have to look out for the liability of the last county taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11814)|
| 3:16:57| If somebody does a day extra in jail that they shouldn't have, we're going to be seeing some lawsuits potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11817)|
| 3:17:05| David, is there anything you would like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11825)|
| 3:17:10| What I would suggest is this has already been evaluated five times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11830)|
| 3:17:17| There are five reports already on the JEMS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11837)|
| 3:17:21| And these were done by experts in the performance area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11841)|
| 3:17:25| I would suggest that – and these – Dick Moran has those down in his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11845)|
| 3:17:31| And I would urge all the commissioners to get with Dick, talk with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11851)|
| 3:17:40| And you don't need to notice a meeting if you're talking with Dick about the system, what his analysis of it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11860)|
| 3:17:49| And I think you'll find everything that we found so far is in the transfer of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11869)|
| 3:17:55| because you've got the judges with paper warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11875)|
| 3:17:58| You've got the clerk that's got this entering this in the JEMS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11878)|
| 3:18:04| Then you've got the sheriff out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11884)|
| 3:18:06| And all he does, he's really not part of this because what happens is he –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11886)|
| 3:18:13| he arrests somebody out in the field or stops them and runs their license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11893)|
| 3:18:18| or their name through the JEMS system and he finds that there's an attachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11898)|
| 3:18:23| If there's an attachment out, for whatever reason, he's got no choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11903)|
| 3:18:28| He's got to bring that person in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11908)|
| 3:18:31| So the question is, and this is what Dick can explain much better than I can sitting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11911)|
| 3:18:37| and I think if you start with those reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11917)|
| 3:18:39| then you've got a good basis to go on what you want to do as far as a performance audit of the entire system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11919)|
| 3:18:47| But the JEMS system should work if it's like everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11927)|
| 3:18:54| What you put in the system is very important to what comes out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11934)|
| 3:18:59| Could I make a suggestion then, Brad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11939)|
| 3:19:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11941)|
| 3:19:02| The audit committee is not scheduled to meet again until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11942)|
| 3:19:06| And this group will meet again before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11946)|
| 3:19:09| So could I suggest that we all try to get together with Dick Moran as we can individually and talk with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11949)|
| 3:19:16| and think it over and then in our December commission meeting reach a consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11956)|
| 3:19:22| on how we would like to direct the audit committee to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11962)|
| 3:19:27| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11967)|
| 3:19:28| Mr. Law Director, do you have a statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11968)|
| 3:19:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11971)|
| 3:19:32| I'm not really going to go into details because, as you know, what happens inside my office stays inside my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11972)|
| 3:19:38| But I have had several meetings with the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11978)|
| 3:19:40| I've had several meetings with the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11980)|
| 3:19:43| I've had several meetings with the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11983)|
| 3:19:45| I've had several meetings with the IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11985)|
| 3:19:50| I think a lot of the issues have been the root causes have been identified as to some of the seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11990)|
| 3:19:57| or more issues that were brought to the press' attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=11997)|
| 3:20:02| I think the judges are dealing with some of the issues right now that may resolve some of the problems of recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12002)|
| 3:20:10| And that's the real issue we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12010)|
| 3:20:13| And a lot of things are a matter of timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12013)|
| 3:20:17| Timing means a charge, a dismissal, a violation of probation, a VOP, and an attachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12017)|
| 3:20:29| And sometimes they will happen where they're not dismissed, even though they should be dismissed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12029)|
| 3:20:35| and it's just a matter of timing and how can we cure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12035)|
| 3:20:39| And so there's a lot of issues that's outside the clerk's control, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12039)|
| 3:20:45| It has to do, you know, even with the DA's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12045)|
| 3:20:47| It's a lot more complex than I'm just failing to write down something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12047)|
| 3:20:54| So I guess what I'm saying is that I think that after you talk to Mr. Moran and the electronic system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12054)|
| 3:21:04| and the judges are working on their end of it, I think there may be some solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12064)|
| 3:21:09| Also, there have been like four of these type of audits in different phases that have occurred that the chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12069)|
| 3:21:18| Anders, has mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12078)|
| 3:21:19| And I think that her department has had somewhere in the neighborhood of two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12079)|
| 3:21:22| or three outside financial audits in the past 12 to 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12082)|
| 3:21:27| And everything's been a clean bill of health on the financial side, as Commissioner Shouse has discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12087)|
| 3:21:32| So I think things are moving is what I'm just trying to let you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12092)|
| 3:21:38| that things are being looked at and addressed and the issues are not just located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12098)|
| 3:21:45| It's a systematic issue, not just a departmental issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12105)|
| 3:21:49| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12109)|
| 3:21:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12111)|
| 3:21:52| So from a financial point of view or an audit committee point of view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12112)|
| 3:21:58| or the new internal auditor a month away situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12118)|
| 3:22:07| what we're talking about right now is not related to any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12127)|
| 3:22:11| This information flow, this does the system work, or the judge is trying to fix the system of information flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12131)|
| 3:22:21| It's not an audit committee thing then, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12141)|
| 3:22:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12143)|
| 3:22:24| Am I hearing that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12144)|
| 3:22:25| Not currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12145)|
| 3:22:27| I mean, we could ask her in three to six months after implementation of these new processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12147)|
| 3:22:32| to go check and see how they're working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12152)|
| 3:22:34| But right now, no, that's not an audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12154)|
| 3:22:36| I don't know that there's a function that the audit team could find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12156)|
| 3:22:40| Well, and the audit committee work that's going on right now is the closeout of the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12160)|
| 3:22:50| Within between now, well, maybe right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12170)|
| 3:22:53| there is the preliminary findings coming out about the consolidated county stuff ending fiscal year back in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12173)|
| 3:23:04| So that's talking about dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12184)|
| 3:23:06| What we're talking about right now is relates to this particular elected official is not then financial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12186)|
| 3:23:13| It's a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12193)|
| 3:23:15| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12195)|
| 3:23:16| You know, the only thing, and I've been a little bit on the outside, not being on the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12196)|
| 3:23:20| and not obviously being involved in some of these discussions in the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12200)|
| 3:23:26| if we indeed have had four or five, as David mentioned, audits that the IT has there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12206)|
| 3:23:34| I think we need to look at these very carefully and see do we really need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12214)|
| 3:23:39| We may be able to draw our conclusions without spending more money for someone to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12219)|
| 3:23:44| and do more consulting work because ultimately our goal is to have an office up there that when things happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12224)|
| 3:23:51| it gets recorded and we don't have any of these so-called errors that have caused some improper incarceration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12231)|
| 3:23:59| And I think we all agree on that, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12239)|
| 3:24:03| I just think we don't need to be jumping right again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12243)|
| 3:24:05| and get another consultant to do something that's already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12245)|
| 3:24:11| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12251)|
| 3:24:13| Any new discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12253)|
| 3:24:15| Announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12255)|
| 3:24:17| Meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131118?start=12257)|
