| 0:01:10| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| First item on the agenda for this public hearing is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=71)|
| 0:01:13| I know as of yesterday afternoon or this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=73)|
| 0:01:15| we had not received any requests to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=75)|
| 0:01:21| So, at this point, we'll move into discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=81)|
| 0:01:25| If commissioners have any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=85)|
| 0:01:27| I know Mr. Caldwell and Ms. Bode are here from the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=87)|
| 0:01:32| There's a couple of other department heads in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=92)|
| 0:01:35| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=95)|
| 0:01:38| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=98)|
| 0:01:42| I'll recognize Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=102)|
| 0:01:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| We are discussing budget, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| I'm on the Fire and Rescue Committee, and we've been meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| We're starting to get emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| We've been meeting for four months on funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=115)|
| 0:01:59| Tonight we're going to approve $605,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| But we're trying to come up with a funding model for Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| CARDS, and the Rescue Squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| And it's not an easy – believe me, this has not been an easy task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| So, I'm going to get Perry to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| Perry's – hello, Perry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| I told you I was going to call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=137)|
| 0:02:19| I'm right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| We met yesterday and come up with two models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=140)|
| 0:02:24| And these two models, they're not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| Just like we said yesterday, you could do 100 variables in these models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| So, the model that was recommended takes a huge cut to the Rescue Squad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=153)|
| 0:02:44| but that's still debatable because it's got to come before the whole committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| So, if you or whatever you need to add, Perry, to help explain what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| But it is a work in progress, believe me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| Yeah, it's Perry Banchoff, Knox County Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| We've been kind of exploring this and working with this committee for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=179)|
| 0:03:05| It's – what we came up with yesterday is, like you said, not a perfect model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| It takes into account several different attributes of response times and population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| and coverage areas and all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| So, I think so far it's the best model we've come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| But, yeah, it doesn't favor the Rescue Squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=203)|
| 0:03:30| So, it's – like I say, it is a work in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| We meet with the full committee next Wednesday to see how they all want to take it from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=214)|
| 0:03:41| But that's just kind of a slight update of how that's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| If there's anything else you'd like to hear about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| But it's not a perfect solution and it's not going to make everybody happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| And that's just not impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| So, that's kind of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| You're going to hear more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| Thank you, Perry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| Any other commissioners have questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| If not, the chair will entertain a motion to adjourn this public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| I have a motion to adjourn to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| Public hearing is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220601-public-budget-hearing?start=264)|
