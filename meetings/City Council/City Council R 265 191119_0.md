| 0:02:56| on their 100-year anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| I don't see a number to the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=178)|

| 0:03:07| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| You all should have that resolution in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| That motion to honor the NAACP is added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| Anything else to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| Any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| So there's no consent items, so we'll move on to the Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| It's always nice to start off a Mayor's Report by recognizing quality work by exemplary people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=211)|
| 0:03:38| So tonight, it's my pleasure to introduce the City's 2019 Employee of the Year and the finalists for that award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=218)|
| 0:03:48| As I told our employees last month at the Mayor's Employee Appreciation Picnic at Caswell Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=228)|
| 0:03:55| it takes a dedicated team to make a city work, much less work as well as Knoxville does, thanks to our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=235)|
| 0:04:02| Our employees lay the groundwork for our city to achieve goals, large and small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| And every day for the past eight years, I have been impressed with and grateful for the know-how, the creativity, and the work ethic of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=246)|
| 0:04:16| Together, we're making a difference in the lives of all city residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| And I'll explain briefly the Employee of the Year Award and how that person is selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=261)|
| 0:04:27| So this is an employee-led initiative designed by our City Ambassadors Group to recognize people in non-uniformed departments who are doing a superior job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=267)|
| 0:04:38| So the Police and Fire Departments already have long-established employee recognition programs, and a few of our other departments did as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=278)|
| 0:04:45| But there were a lot of departments that didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| So our City Ambassadors created this program for the non-uniformed bodies, where each of the general government departments could nominate one front-line employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=288)|
| 0:04:57| It can't be a Director or a Deputy Director for Employee of the Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| This year's finalists are really a stellar group, and I'm going to call their names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| I'd like for them to come forward as I call your names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| Where is everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| Are they all around back there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| Okay, well, come on forward to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| Joe Collins, who's with Public Grounds Maintenance and Public Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=318)|

| 0:05:24| Derby Romero de Poppenbrock, our City Court Assistant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| Elaine Frank in the Office of Special Events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=330)|

| 0:05:50| Russ Richard, Survey Project Manager in Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| And Rodney Wilson, Heavy Shop Fleet Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=356)|
| 0:06:04| So these were the finalists who were recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| I want to first give them a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=369)|
| 0:06:18| And then from this group of finalists, the City Ambassadors selected an overall Employee of the Year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| and that is Russ Richard, Survey Project Manager for the Civil Engineering Division of the Engineering Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=384)|
| 0:06:31| So let's give all of them another round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=391)|
| 0:06:48| So thank you all again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| We can't honor you enough, really, for all that you do, but we appreciate your work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| and thank you for coming tonight so we could honor you here in front of City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=414)|
| 0:07:04| So there are some important upcoming events I want to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| First, this Thursday afternoon we'll be cutting a ribbon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| and officially dedicating the new Augusta Avenue entrance to Fort Dickerson Park and the Augusta Quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| The ribbon cutting will be at 3.30 p.m. on Thursday, November 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| and that is at 550 Augusta Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| We're especially thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| We're going to have all the different partners and people who participated there, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| but we're also especially thankful for Aslan Foundation's vision and partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| Aslan Foundation funded the design work for the Augusta Avenue entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| as well as providing $330,000 toward its construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| Then later that day at 5.30 p.m. on Thursday, November 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| the City will be hosting a public meeting along with the Clayton Family Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| to discuss the topic of the Knoxville Science Museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| That museum will be held here in the small assembly room of the City-County Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| So representatives of Clayton Family Foundation and Barbara McMurray Architects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| will present three sets of concept plans defining the vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| for a proposed $100 million Interactive Educational Science and Discovery Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=500)|
| 0:08:26| and Council will recall when we talked and voted on that previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| The Clayton Family Foundation will be building the state-of-the-art facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| near the Civic Auditorium and Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| So they'll be presenting some of the concept plans that they are working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| as they come to their final plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| They want feedback from the community, so we invite you to come and provide that feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| So next I want to talk about Christmas in the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| The festivities kick off this coming Friday, November 22nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| with Christmas at Chilhowee from 6 to 9 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| Now this is a little bit of a change from our normal schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| Usually this happens later in December, but we are doing it earlier this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| due to the arrival of the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| The so-called People's Tree is a 60-foot blue spruce that is touring the nation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| before it decorates the lawn of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| So it will be in Knoxville at Chilhowee Park on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| So we'll have our annual Christmas at Chilhowee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| We'll do it on this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=572)|

| 0:26:24| Those are ordinances on second reading, so typically council has asked all their questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| during the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1589)|

| 0:27:39| I was going to ask Mr. Mills to kind of give the overview to Council on what the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| Councilmembers, to my understanding, this is the first appeal that we've had with regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| to a decision by the Urban Forester to deny a permit to cut down or substantially prune| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1671)|
| 0:27:58| a tree that's located on historical property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| The code section that's involved here is 14-35, and if you'll permit me, I'll read a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| of parts from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| Subsection A, no living tree within the city with a trunk diameter of 20 inches or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| at one foot above the ground, which is located within 150 feet of any building built in or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1696)|
| 0:28:23| before the year 1860, shall be cut or otherwise substantially altered by pruning, trimming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| or otherwise cutting more than 20% of the woody area of such tree without first obtaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| a permit from the city horticulturalist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| Subsection B, permits as noted in subsection A of this section shall be issued only upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| a satisfactory showing that the tree in question is not of such historical or botanical importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| that the public interest would be served through the preservation of such tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| There was a request made for a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| That request was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| Under subsection C, the appeal for that denial goes to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| It is a de novo appeal, meaning it is a fresh hearing without any kind of presumption with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1743)|
| 0:29:09| regard to the correctness of the decision of the Urban Forester, and Council has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1749)|
| 0:29:17| authority to uphold the denial of the permit, to order the permit be issued, or to order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| a permit be issued with such other altered conditions as Council may approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1763)|
| 0:29:29| So that is the standard, and I don't know if Mr. Krause is here to discuss the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| He's here if Council has any questions of him during the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1775)|
| 0:29:43| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Mr. Mills, can you give us a little background of why this was put in place, if you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| I do not, although I will point out that this section has been in the Code for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| It is part of the general tree protection section of the Code, Chapter 14 of the Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1796)|
| 0:30:03| which essentially establishes standards for protection of trees both on public property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| and in some situations on private property, and these have historical value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| It puts the burden on the party requesting the permit in this particular case to make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1813)|
| 0:30:21| showing that the permit should be issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| Mr. Frost, do you know any more than what we've already heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| No, I don't, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| When I first heard about it, I did not know this ordinance actually existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| I think Mr. Bryce would like to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| Actually, Vice Mayor Saunders, it's my understanding that under Mayor Ashe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| as part of our requirements to be a Tree City USA, you had to have a tree board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| you had to have a tree protection ordinance, and Casey, what's the other requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| A certain amount of dollars put in per capita for trees, and so an ordinance was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| and my understanding was this was integrated at that time, and it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| Ron, I'm not sure if you've got the year it was adopted, but I believe it was during Mr. Ashe's term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| It does not show in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| It only lists the codification date of 1962, so I believe that would be correct, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| I did some research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| It was 1989 it was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| Any other questions before we let the folks from Blount Mansion speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1883)|

| 0:31:40| As you know, Blount Mansion is the only National Historic Landmark in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| the home of a Constitution signer and our territorial governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| but we are also Knoxville's only public garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| Our gardens have been tended by the Garden Club of Knoxville since 1934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| In 1972, the Knoxville Garden Study Club, which is an auxiliary of the Garden Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| commissioned Edith Henderson, who is a pioneering female landscape architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| to design a beautiful parterre garden behind the Craighead Jackson House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| This is a circa 1818 structure that is adjacent to Blount Mansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| It called for a mix of trees, and over the ensuing decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| the magnolia trees that were in the design have grown too large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| and have choked out the other trees in the garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| We discovered this when we set out to restore the original garden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| so that people can enjoy it again as part of what we offer the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| We noticed that the roots of the tree had started to disrupt the bricks in the walkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| but more alarmingly, our experts have told us that the tree is actually beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| to threaten the historical integrity of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| We love our trees. We don't like taking them down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| but in this case, we find ourselves in a peculiar circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| simply because of the age of the house and the girth of the tree, as you've heard in this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| The tree is just a few months older than I am, and I don't like to think I'm historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| I believe in your packets, we brought some letters of support from Knox Heritage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| attesting to the significance of the building and how the tree threatens it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| from Johnson and Galleon to speak structurally to what it might be doing to the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| and also from two Daughters of the American Revolution chapters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| who have committed $500 each to plant up to 20 new trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| to replace this tree and the other smaller overgrown magnolias| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| that we need to take down to restore Edith Henderson's design to the Cricket Jackson House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| Thank you, sir. Did you want to speak, Mr. Hearns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| I mean, Mr. Hearns, right? I had it right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| As he said, thank you so much for hearing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| Quite simply, as he said, we don't really want to take the tree down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| but it's necessary in order to be able to complete this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| Blount Mansion has a long history of preservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| and so it's not a decision that we made lightly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| but it's the only way that we can see forward to being able to replant the garden as it's intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| and also to fix the hardscape of the garden and to protect the trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| or excuse me, to protect the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| Thank you. Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| Well, I was just going to ask you, Mr. Hearns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| you started with to complete your project was your first reason for needing to take the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| But you followed up with your third point of being to protect the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| because I think that being one of the only reasons that to me has merit to why this would need to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2055)|
| 0:34:24| we would have to make an exception to the ordinance that's in place that qualifies us to be a Tree City USA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2064)|
| 0:34:32| I would like to ask Mr. Krause if he could comment on that status and this particular request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2072)|
| 0:34:41| and maybe also comment on would you plant this tree next to a structure like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2081)|
| 0:34:51| Sure. Casey Krause, urban forester for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| To your last question, would I plant this next to a structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| I think the distance this particular tree is from the structure is probably suitable in most situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2100)|
| 0:35:10| There are some limitations on root growth for this particular tree to grow, most notably to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2110)|
| 0:35:18| There are a lot of remedies that can be employed as well to deter roots from getting into the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2118)|
| 0:35:25| And in my experience, oftentimes the issue with structural is there are defects with the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2125)|
| 0:35:34| and then roots take advantage of the opportunity where there is moisture and oxygen present in those cracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2134)|
| 0:35:41| They go for it. They travel to the moisture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| Yes, exactly. To speak on this, obviously my job is to protect trees when all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2144)|
| 0:35:53| I never really get involved with the trees on private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| but for this particular situation when it's brought forward to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| the intent was to bring back the design of a tree, a design from back in 1972.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2160)|
| 0:36:09| We are now looking at the age of a design next to the age of the tree, which are in a sense about the same age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2169)|
| 0:36:17| If not, the tree is actually older than the design in itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| because it most likely was five to six years older when the time it was planted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| So you believe, and I don't know if the folks from Plum Mansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| you believe that the tree was there prior to the design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| Well, if you look back at actually some of the documents that I got today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| the picture from 1972, you can actually look at the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| This one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Those trees are about six to seven foot tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| I would say they're five or six years older at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| Obviously transplanted at that point in time, so they grew offsite at another location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| So you start aging trees at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| The age of the tree would actually predate the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| But the tree was installed as part of this landscape design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| Yes, and that's where I was saying at that point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| you are looking at an age of a design next to the age of the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| So when I have to look at it from a historical standpoint, that's what I was looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| And I will say on top of the sheer fact that the tree is 20 inches in diameter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2247)|
| 0:37:36| I think many people in this room would say that that is not a historical tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| And my problem was trying to look at what was the intent of this ordinance to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2262)|
| 0:37:50| And essentially I think it outlines it that the historical aspect is not so much the size or the age of the tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2270)|
| 0:38:00| but the proximity of that tree next to a building that is historic in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| So that's where I had to, from this standpoint, say that a tree that is 20 inches diameter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2286)|
| 0:38:16| no, it's not historical in the sense that the tree is not from 1860, but it's next to a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2296)|
| 0:38:23| And with as little information I have for this code, I had to go with what the code says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2303)|
| 0:38:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| I do want to clarify, this picture here on the bottom of the packet, on first blush, when I looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| I thought this was maybe a foundation of a structure, but it's actually the retaining wall for the road in the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2318)|
| 0:38:45| So when you look at the picture, it looks like the tree is right next to a structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| But then when I look at the top picture of the tree, how far is the tree away from the house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| I would say 25 to 40 feet, somewhere in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2336)|
| 0:39:04| So that's not unreasonable for a tree of that size to be planted that close to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| That's not unreasonable for a tree of that size to be planted that close to a structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2352)|
| 0:39:19| We've got trees in downtown that are twice that size that are closer to buildings than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| I mean, we have that in my neighborhood as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| The houses are 100-plus years old, and the trees are that same distance and that same size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2367)|
| 0:39:33| So I'm just trying to factor it all in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| So suffice it to say that when the tree was planted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| I don't think that anyone could have anticipated the rate of growth or the roots and how they've taken form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2384)|
| 0:39:51| And we do see indication here that it is interfering and destroying some of the pathway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2391)|
| 0:39:59| the bricks that are in the pathway as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2399)|
| 0:40:05| Given the fact that you've indicated this is not a historical tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| but we know factually that this house is historical and predates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| we know that there are also some, I think, hindsight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| This tree probably would have been planted maybe a little bit further away from the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| I think that's probably the first argument that I would have come to the table with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| Also, we understand that it is this tree, the size of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| in addition to the rooting problem is drowning out the ability for anything else to grow in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2434)|
| 0:40:41| That was originally designed to be a garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| So I just wanted to make sure that we're clear on those facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| And so I think my first concern would be potential for any structural things with those roots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2447)|
| 0:40:53| I think any of us who live in older homes or neighborhoods have at some point encountered ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| or our neighbors root damage to piping and foundation at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| And so thank you all for your expertise and your insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| And those are all of my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| Casey, give us the specific name of this tree, the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| It's a southern magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| And as a southern magnolia, is that typically found in urban settings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| It's found throughout the greater Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| In urban settings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| Downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Yeah, which is unique about this particular species.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| It is one of the largest southern magnolias that we actually have in the downtown area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| which when it came to the cross, does it have any botanical significance as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| It's not just historical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| It's also if it has botanical significance that was also of consideration for this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2509)|
| 0:41:56| So are the roots causing visual damage to the house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| Can you tell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| So with my assessment, and I did allow Blunt Mansion to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| and I had not gotten any information from them as far as any type of damage to the roots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| The information I got from them is that it was potentially going to cause issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2534)|
| 0:42:20| I did a level one assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| I did not go into detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| But what I did allow them to do is if they wanted to provide, get a certified arborist on their own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| to supply me with that type of information that the tree was going to cause damage to the foundation or was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2548)|
| 0:42:35| that I would reconsider my choice on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| Did y'all do that, Michael?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| Have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| Have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| Would that tree, would it, do you think its roots would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| is it a type of tree that would cause damage to structures nearby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| Is it that type of tree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| In my experience, roots are all, they're going after two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| It's water and oxygen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| And if there's water and oxygen in any particular foundation, any tree is going to go that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| I don't care if it's a dogwood all the way up to an oak tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| There's nothing you can do to stop that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| There are remedies that you can put in play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| What would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| You could put in root deterrent mats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| We employ this all the time in downtown areas as far as putting in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2596)|
| 0:43:22| essentially mats and barriers that reduce the likelihood of moisture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| from going into a foundation or into a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2607)|
| 0:43:33| That's probably the most feasible option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| Is that practical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| You could root prune on a yearly matter if you needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| Is that practical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| Is it practical to put a root barrier or to put a-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| Put a root barrier now on a-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| Oh, yeah, it's very, I mean, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| Is it practical to trim roots once a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| That's the, I would say, a little bit less practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| Less practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| And do you judge it based on what you think the value of that tree is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| Do you put a monetary value on it as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| I mean, any monetary value, I mean, you would have to look at a couple different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| Yeah, I could go out there and do a tree appraisal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| but typically that's done in a situation where there's some kind of negligence that goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| Let's say, for instance, somebody removed a public tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| and I had to go out and figure out the value of that particular tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| For this matter, I had to look at it from a public standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| What is that value to the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| And you can, there's a lot of research out there as far as large mature trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| The more tree cover that we have in a defined area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| the better it is for social benefits, environmental benefits, and economic benefits as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| So I have to weigh those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| Now, when I looked at it from the standpoint of the public, as I do with all public trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| this one's particular, this particular tree's on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| I had to look at it to see, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| is this tree causing any safety or health-related issues for the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| And I don't see that being the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| Mr. Kraussman, Roberta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| I think, Mr. Kraussman, I'm considering this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| that the issue of structural damage to the building I think is really what my focus is at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2718)|
| 0:45:28| So I heard what you said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| You haven't done a full inspection of it to the level of knowing for sure there is or isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| I don't know if the, Mr. Jordan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| I don't know if you want to say anything about the damage that you're noticing in the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| I'll let Mr. Burns speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| Well, the two main concerns structurally that I have are the potential of the tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| given its height and size and weight, falling potentially as a multi-trunk tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| If it were to split, you've got a very large chunk of the tree heading straight for the back of the house to land on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| The other, from the root side of things, is as the roots have spread out through the garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| it's heading for the bridge, it's heading for the back door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| it's heading into the garden itself, disrupting the pathways and the irrigation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2768)|
| 0:46:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| So what I heard you say is potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| I didn't hear you say you have damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| There's potential for damage in the fact that it could fall over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| or that the roots could penetrate and damage the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| When you see the way the roots are and heading for the back porch and heading for the back door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| I can only assume that they're heading under and heading for the foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| That's my thought process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| Mr. Krause, so hearing those issues, I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| It's a large tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| I had a not nearly as big tree in my front yard where it split and had to lose one limb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| But my house is not nearly as old or historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| So, you know, is there something that can be done to look at addressing the potential damage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| that they're talking about with this particular tree, or do you see any danger there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| I think that, you know, if a structural engineer of some sort would come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| and tell me that there was significant structural defects to the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| I would say then, yeah, there's a good opportunity the roots would be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| But I guess my argument against that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| would we not want to just go ahead and address the structural issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| and eliminate that opportunity for the roots to go there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| Well, what I'm asking about first, I want to get to the roots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| but what I'm asking about first is the first issue they discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| which was the tree falling on the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| Do you see a risk there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| Is there something that can be done to mitigate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| I mean, that's, again, I did a Level 1 risk assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| I did not see anything that showed that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| which is essentially for a Level 1 risk assessment is a walk around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| You can do more advanced, a Level 2 or a Level 3, getting more advanced, more techniques.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| And looking at that, looking at the root system and there's a lot of options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| and that's where I was saying that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| I would give them an opportunity to get their certified arborist out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| to do a more thorough inspection to see if there was a high level of risk associated with this tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| There's risk to every single tree out there in the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2900)|
| 0:48:27| It's that threshold of risk that we have to try and mitigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| Now, as far as it splitting off and possibly splitting in half or coming up from the roots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| you know, that's something where a more thorough inspection would probably need to be warranted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2916)|
| 0:48:42| but I did not see anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| And that inspection has not been done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| The inspection you're talking about has not been done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| I don't have any information on a more advanced tree risk assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| And the root issue could be dealt with by you have some techniques, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| you could deal with to deal with the root issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| Yeah, there's a lot of options as far as trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| I mean, the best option is just fix your foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| but there's always options as far as, you know, cushion to put in there as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| to try and deter roots from going into a foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| Councilwoman McKenzie, did you want to jump in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| I'd like to direct this question to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| So if this appeal were to be approved, what does that actually mean as it relates to Blunton Mansion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| Would they then go down the path of getting these additional inspections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| So if you could please give us some clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| If the permit is approved, then the tree can be taken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| If the appeal is approved, then they can take the tree down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| If the appeal is approved, then the permit is issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| I'd like to ask the lawyers, if the appeal is denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| what is their recourse if they were to come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| Because I have a couple of questions, but what I'm hearing you guys say is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| you want to remove the tree because it didn't perform as anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| in the renowned landscape architect's design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| not because it's threatening the house, which I'm very aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| I had a tree fall on my house last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| I'm not even done with the repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| And that's because we knew it was going to fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| and I ignored all wise comments to tell me to take it down because I was like, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| So I'm paying the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| But please tell me what happens if we deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| What is their recourse to come back with expert opinion if it were to be threatening the structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| If you want to give Blunt Mansion the opportunity to go consult with an arborist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| as Mr. Krause has suggested, I would suggest you would not deny tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| that you would postpone the matter to allow them, them being Blunt Mansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| to have the opportunity to find an arborist, to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| for them to have the opportunity, the arborist, to consult with Mr. Krause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| and give him more information because, I mean, respectfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| what Blunt Mansion has submitted is a design issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| It doesn't get into the standards that Mr. Krause is charged with applying to the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3069)|
| 0:51:20| And, Mr. Krause, the reason this ordinance is in place is for us to be a tree city USA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| Could you briefly touch on the importance of our treescape and why we would have trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| and why we would need to have such an ordinance to try and preserve trees that are large?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3090)|
| 0:51:37| Sure. I mean, I'm constantly trying to preach as much as I can the importance of tree cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3097)|
| 0:51:46| I think that when you start to look back at a lot of the old ways of looking at trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| it was for landscaping purposes or for beautification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| But this day and age, a lot of that has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| We now know that there's a lot of social benefits associated with trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| such as education, crime, a lot of economic benefits associated with trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3123)|
| 0:52:15| People tend to go shop in tree-lined streets as opposed to those that don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| And then we can always get into the vast environmental benefits as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3139)|
| 0:52:25| going from air quality to reduction in stormwater and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3145)|
| 0:52:31| So there's a tremendous amount of benefits associated with trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| And what that all goes back to is the more tree cover, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| And that's what all of those benefits are directly correlated back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| I think one of my concerns is I'm hearing colleagues say it's not a historic tree, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| But if a new tree is planted, it'll be maybe three to six years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| And this tree, if it were, if you guesstimate based on Mr. Krause's expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| that it was maybe six when it was planted, it's been there for 47 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| This tree is over 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| That sets us 50 years back in achieving that treescape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| which addresses heat islands and other things from all the surrounding concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| And without it threatening the structure as being the rationale for the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| I have a hard time supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| Mr. Krause, it's a southern magnolia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| Is that native to Tennessee and Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| It is not native to East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| It is native to the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| So it's a non-native tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| And is the Blount Mansion's plan to replace it with other trees after it's removed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3224)|
| 0:53:51| You know, this certainly puts us between a rock and a hard place or a rock and a tree, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| You know, we all love trees and obviously appreciate the Blount Mansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| I'm supporting the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| I think they haven't done this willy-nilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| They're trying to bring people into it to show off the garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| That tree has really overtaken that garden, which is an important part of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3252)|
| 0:54:18| This is staff that answers to a board that's looking to preserve, you know, I guess the oldest building in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3258)|
| 0:54:29| So, you know, I think we have to trust them at some level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| It's a non-native tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| You know, the whole thing with being next to a historic building, presumably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| then it was sort of the same age as the building it's next to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| That's not the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| It's going to be replaced by other trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| So, you know, I think it's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| I think it's fantastic we've had this much discussion about trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| And I certainly agree with all the benefits of trees and shade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| And, you know, I love them myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| But I would move to support the appeal of the Blount Mansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| Did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| Okay, so there is a motion to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| Motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3323)|
| 0:55:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| Two nos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| Who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| Councilman Roberto and Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| So your appeal passes 7-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| I also want to, you know, what we recognize here is that you have a staff person who has an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| who's got the obligation to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| But that's why it is at the discretion of council to decide if there are other factors to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| So thank you, Casey, for doing your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| And thank you to Blount Mansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| Be careful what you plant because you might have to come back if you want to cut it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| You don't know who will be sitting up here in 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| 11A is the resolution authorizing the mayor, subject to the city's successful closing of its property acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| a property from Metro HMA to execute all documents necessary to convey certain real property located at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3374)|
| 0:56:22| 1705 St. Mary Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, known as the Magdalen Clark Tower property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| to Knoxville's Community Development Corporation for purposes of redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| and to approve KCDC's subsequent transfer of this property to Lincoln Memorial University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| in order to develop the site for a future nursing school, business school, and criminal justice school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3397)|
| 0:56:43| A motion we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| 11B is the resolution authorizing the mayor to accept the proposal from HM Insurance Group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3417)|
| 0:57:03| for stop-loss insurance for the city's self-insured medical plan and prescription drug plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| I just wanted to ask Ms. Fitzgerald if I know there was quite an increase in the insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3431)|
| 0:57:20| and is that anticipated to be kind of a one-time with that potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| or there's no way of knowing what happens from year to year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| There's no way to know what happens from year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| We can't really predict our claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| As of today, I got a new report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| We have 10 large claimants over 125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| The average is 272,000, whereas last year at this time it was 170,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| And last year we only had four large claimants over 125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| So the tough thing, too, is the property and casualty market is just a really hard market right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3471)|
| 0:57:58| and so stop-loss insurance is part of that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| So even if we would have had the exact same year we would have had last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| I still would have anticipated an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| Maybe not as big?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| Correct, just not as big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| The increase from Blue Cross Blue Shield was a 40% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| And this is something that we pay into because we're self-insured?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| The city is self-insured?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| We would not have this if we were not self-insured?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| If we were fully insured, we would pay premiums to an insurance company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| Because we're self-insured, we want to mitigate our risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| And so that's what the specific deductible is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| So we would pay claims up to the specific deductible for every employee on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| And the benefits of being self-insured as an entity is the savings to the employees in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3522)|
| 0:58:51| In the city, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| Because the premiums the employees pay are lower being self-insured than they might be if you were fully insured?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3534)|
| 0:59:01| When you're fully insured, the insurance company gets the benefit or the risk, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3541)|
| 0:59:07| So if you have a really good year from an insurance company's perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| then the rates would be in such a way that we pay them every month and our premium would be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3551)|
| 0:59:18| And then at the end of that 12-month period, if our loss ratio were under 80%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| then the insurance company makes 20% or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| We would prefer to own the risk so that we can manage our claims better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| This is why we have a robust wellness program in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| why we have an on-site clinic with biometric screenings for our My Health members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| because we want to help people be healthier and then hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| So a very big emphasis on prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| And I will note that our rates have stayed the same for six years in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3590)|
| 0:59:56| Thank you for the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3598)|
| 0:59:59| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3600)|
| 1:00:01| Just a quick follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| I really appreciate everything that you do to keep these costs down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| because I know this is a huge part of the city's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| What proportion of the increase in these sort of catastrophic medical expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| is related to prescription drugs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| Is it all medical procedures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| It's all medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| It's all medical procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| The largest claim that we have just hit $920,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| One claimant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| And that's medical procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| No prescription drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| That's a great question, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| Because prescription drug costs are also, is there a stop-loss coverage for that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3632)|
| 1:00:38| We do include RX in our stop-loss, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3651)|
| 1:00:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| Director Fitzgerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| 11C is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute all documents on behalf of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| necessary to acquire in fee simple property located at 2626 and 2634 Ley Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3660)|

| 1:01:11| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3674)|

| 1:01:17| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| 11D is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an agreement with WSP USA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3678)|
| 1:01:25| to design the Broadway Accelerated Bus Corridor for an amount not to exceed $185,788.20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3685)|
| 1:01:32| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| Council, you have a revised amendment or a proposed revision before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| So I'm going to ask our Deputy Law Director to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| Council members, there was a typo in both the resolution and the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| The amount that was listed on the contract was $185,788.20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3710)|
| 1:01:57| That is the City's 20% match for the cost of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| The actual amount is $928,941.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| The amended documents that you have there reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| That amount is the amount of the contract along with the City match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3729)|
| 1:02:15| So we have the first motion to approve and second to approve the resolution before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3735)|
| 1:02:23| I need a motion to amend it to add the not to exceed $928,941.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3743)|
| 1:02:30| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| Councilwoman Ryder, do you want to speak to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| Yeah, I just wanted to ask Director Hagerman to comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| There's been lots of conversation about this for well more than my two years up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3757)|
| 1:02:43| among folks along Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| We had conversations with Cat about this, Broadway Corridor Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| Can you tell us, this is for the design phase, what is the timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3772)|
| 1:02:59| which are always more than people anticipate them to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| The timeline would be a shot in the dark at this point, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3786)|
| 1:03:12| How about a long ballpark shot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| Five years, less than five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| Well, I'd say two years for the design process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| And at that point, we will have a good idea of how much it's actually going to cost to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3801)|
| 1:03:28| Part of the issue here is that the goal posts keep moving, the rules keep changing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3808)|
| 1:03:35| so we don't know exactly what the final cost, final scope is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| So that's why we're just doing the design part first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| so we can get a good handle on what we can do for the resources available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3825)|
| 1:03:52| and whether to ask whether we'd get enough additional value out of asking for more money to make that worthwhile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3832)|
| 1:04:02| And the idea is to make transit more enticing or more reasonable by having an accelerated route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3842)|
| 1:04:13| versus buses that stop at every stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| Well, it's not so much a through route as it is schedule reliability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| It's signals that see a bus coming, give them a little bit of extra green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3862)|
| 1:04:30| if there is congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| We're looking at the possibility of key jump lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| which would allow a bus to basically bypass the stacked up traffic at an intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3875)|
| 1:04:44| That's very much dependent on the amount of space that we have to work with at those places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3884)|
| 1:04:51| where it would have a lot of value to do the key jump process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| But we're also looking at enhanced shelters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| and the shelters would have more live information about how the buses are operating on the corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3901)|
| 1:05:08| when the next one is, that sort of thing, what the schedule is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3908)|
| 1:05:14| So yeah, make it more enticing, but also just make it more reliable and more consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| Well, if it was reliable and consistent, folks would want to ride the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| And they would sit and people would burn less fuel sitting at lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| My concern with this, I just want to voice this for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| is this has been something we've been discussing for I think a minimum of three plus years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| and there are many factors that go into from federal, state, and otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| that make things like this take quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| If the study goes and identifies places where there would be a place for a bus to pull off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3945)|
| 1:05:50| to make that traffic passing possible, that is what we're talking about here that we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| If the study identifies a place where a pull-off could be built along the side of Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3955)|
| 1:06:02| that is at that moment in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| That doesn't mean that that parcel, maybe that parcel is unbuilt and available at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| And as we go down the road, three, five years down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| that parcel may get built up by someone, and it's no longer available as a pull-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| And at this point in time, one of the concerns that come out of Broadway Corridor Task Force is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| there are unbuilt parcels along the Broadway Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| and we don't have a strategy to, say, land bank it to say let's make that available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3986)|
| 1:06:32| And so that's just one of the concerns the community has had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| You make a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| You say this is how the bus could operate and make this accelerated route work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| and then somebody builds $20 million of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| And we're not going to come along then and say, well, now we're going to put a bus pull-off there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| So, you know, these things take time, but those are the components that make it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4009)|
| 1:06:55| can we execute this multiple years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| So those are the concerns that come out of Broadway Corridor Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| We spent a lot of time talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| I'm happy to vote for it, and I hope we see this happen in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| First, we're voting on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4031)|

| 1:10:13| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4213)|

| 1:10:16| Her voice is giving out on her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| So I want to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| We've got some people assigned to speak about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| I want to first ask Dr. Lyons to give us an overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| and then for Gerald Green to give,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| because they've both been actively involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| I'll give you a quick background on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| and some of the logic as to why this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| excuse me, this resolution is something that we support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| In the email I sent you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| I appended the Mayor's statement that she made to the Growth Policy Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| when it meant elaborating the reasons that Mayor O'Hara was supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4248)|
| 1:10:55| Back in 1998,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| the state legislature embarked on a pretty ambitious effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| to deal with growth all over the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| and they passed what was known as Public Chapter 1101| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| that led to a very involved series of meetings all over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| which dealt with two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| One was the ability of cities to annex, cities and towns to annex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4275)|
| 1:11:20| I think it's safe to say that was the primary consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| It was not the only consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| They also dealt with the designation of rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| The city of Knoxville, Farragut, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| had representatives to an original committee trying to hammer out two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| The first was what was called the urban growth boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| and within the urban growth boundary, cities can annex by ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| You may figure, say, what's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| Well, that's something we don't do anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| because it's subsequently been ruled moot basically by state legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| The second was to define areas that were rural in designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| and set the building standards and the development standards within that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| I was in my previous professional life in a position to observe all this very closely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4323)|
| 1:12:08| and I think it's safe to say that the city of Knoxville was heavily engaged with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| on where that urban growth boundary would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| and it involved a very complex set of negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| The discussions about where the rural boundary would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| was mostly held among the constituents outside the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4342)|
| 1:12:27| and there was healthy discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| and I think the arrival at that boundary certainly made an awful lot of sense in the year 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4349)|
| 1:12:36| Well, putting out a couple of points of the legislation, in order for that to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4356)|
| 1:12:42| we had a very complex amendment process which involved the appointment of another growth policy committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4362)|
| 1:12:51| their meeting, proposing changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| and having those changes in any aspect of that plan approved by the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4373)|
| 1:12:59| Knox County, and the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| Partially for that reason, we haven't had any amendment, any convening of that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| between the years 2000 and almost the end of 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| and I think that largely speaks to the point that this is very difficult to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| Mayor Jacobs earlier this year convened the growth policy committee at the request of the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4398)|
| 1:13:25| to revisit the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| As I say, the urban boundary part is irrelevant now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| It doesn't matter. It has no significance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| That committee met and considered an amendment that was proposed by Mayor Jacobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4416)|
| 1:13:43| which basically would remove the rural designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| that part of the rural designation that required all land use changes that were made to go before all three bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4427)|
| 1:13:54| For any change that was going to happen far outside the city limits of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| still would have to be voted on by Knoxville City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| and for that matter by the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| The growth policy committee voted in favor, overwhelmingly, unanimously, in fact, in favor of that amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4446)|
| 1:14:15| and now it is headed toward the three bodies that have to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| The Knox County Commission has approved it in the last couple months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| and the town of Farragut is going to consider it later, and it's before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| So why do we support this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| I think you obviously, a lot of folks have raised some very meaningful questions that we need to address about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4470)|
| 1:14:37| One, the process that we have amounts to a state mandate, state overlay over the land use process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4477)|
| 1:14:45| We have argued against state preemption on all kinds of areas where our argument is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4485)|
| 1:14:51| let the effective body with responsibility for that area make the decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4491)|
| 1:14:57| In this case, we have a process where we have the city of Knoxville and the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| involved making decisions about areas outside their border.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| Another reason we support it is the existing land use regulations stay in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4507)|
| 1:15:14| This is not now open season with development wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| The existing limits that were established within the rural boundaries do remain in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| They would have to be changed, and the appropriate position for that would be through a development of a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4523)|
| 1:15:30| and consideration under normal order, as you might say, by the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4530)|
| 1:15:36| and through the metropolitan, excuse me, Knox County planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| And that process would have to be engaged before any land use could be changed from its present status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4540)|
| 1:15:51| We also support this because this is, we think, very important as a matter of principle beyond just the preemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4551)|
| 1:15:59| There is a sort of a democratic theory preemption of whether one makes decisions about areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4559)|
| 1:16:04| where they don't have any constituents, which would be the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4564)|
| 1:16:09| And it also shows a basic respect for the political process to be engaged in by the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4569)|
| 1:16:16| in the same manner that land use decisions are made all over Knox County aside from in these two areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| So it applies a consistency to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| We know the concerns are very real that people have, and they're very much outcome oriented concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| but we think this, and we share those, and we're all Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| We all have representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| When that process is engaged, I would encourage everybody to participate in that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| and not to take the position that we don't trust that process, which I've heard enunciated in certain occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4599)|
| 1:16:48| We've heard it suggested, and I think there's a good case that's made that we want to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| that we should just delay this until there's a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| and then see whether that sector plan meets basically the city's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| I think a better route, and I'm going to turn this over to Gerald Green here in a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| is to say that, to move away from the city having basically a veto over what's Knox County business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4627)|
| 1:17:15| into participating in that plan, which, as Mr. Green will tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| that he wants that sector plan should involve the city and the county as it's prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| To me, that is a much more viable and respectful way for our colleagues in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4645)|
| 1:17:31| Before I toss it over to Mr. Green, I also want to say that a lot of this has our degree of respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4651)|
| 1:17:38| for our sister legislative body, the Knox County Commission, and their ability to function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| and not basically say we want to take away certain prerogatives from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4663)|
| 1:17:49| One last argument, I think, or position I want to call an argument that is valid that we need to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4669)|
| 1:17:55| is this will have impact, what happens here does have impact on the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4675)|
| 1:18:01| Well, it most certainly does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| Zoning all over the county does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| Every decision that county commission makes, many of them will have some sort of impact on the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4685)|
| 1:18:10| Virtually every decision we make has impact on people who live outside the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4690)|
| 1:18:16| By that criteria, we would be hamstrung and both bodies would be pretty hamstrung| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| in getting approval of the sister body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| The land use is, in all other areas, land use is a function of and a responsibility of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4705)|
| 1:18:32| outside the city's responsibility of the Knox County Commission, and we think we should respect that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| and participate toward the same goals that we share, which is we want to minimize sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4717)|
| 1:18:44| Everything we stood for in the city, we would hope that is represented in this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| and I think we should be active in pursuing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| I think we share the same outcome concerns that many of the people who expressed concerns to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4730)|
| 1:18:56| It's just a matter of how we get there and what's the appropriate role of city government under this 1101| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4736)|
| 1:19:02| and where we are on this legislation right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| So, Mr. Green, I will toss it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4745)|
| 1:19:06| First, let me say thank you, Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| I think that's an excellent overview of framing the issues as we see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| Where you refer to sector plan, I believe you mean general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| Okay, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| Gerald Green, Knoxville, Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| I'll try not to repeat anything Dr. Lyons said, but I want to emphasize a couple of points he made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4760)|
| 1:19:26| One, that the growth policy plan in place was started being developed in the late 1990s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4766)|
| 1:19:32| was adopted around 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| We are living in the county by rules that were made almost 20 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| that are no longer applicable, that were frozen in time 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| The mandate under the growth policy plan was to be revisited every three to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| It has not been revisited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| Those locked in place mandates from 20 years ago are restricting the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4791)|
| 1:19:56| and the development opportunities in what's now designated as the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| With the approach that the county has agreed to take, and that's to update its general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4801)|
| 1:20:07| and I'll speak to that a bit more fully in a few minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| we will revisit those rules and actually put in standards that look forward instead of looking backward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4811)|
| 1:20:17| In terms of any amendment in the rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| a change subsequent to the adoption of this amendment to the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4820)|
| 1:20:26| there's still the legislative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| Any change would have to be approved by the appropriate legislative body for doing those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4828)|
| 1:20:34| That's the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| The city of Knoxville would no longer have purview over those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| and I'll just reinforce by agreeing with Dr. Lyons' statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4839)|
| 1:20:44| about the inappropriateness of one legislative body having a say over an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4844)|
| 1:20:52| in which none of its constituents live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| Finally, with regard to the general plan update, we have been discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| we, Knoxville and Knox County planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| have been discussing with both the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| and the Knox County Mayor's Office the budget and the schedule for updating that general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4864)|
| 1:21:10| We are committed to starting work on the first steps of that next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| and really working hard in the beginning of the new year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| in order to have that effort fully underway by the middle of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| There's a lot of background work in terms of scope of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| preparing an RFQ, retaining consultants, pulling together the full budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4886)|
| 1:21:31| but that is a process, because it's a countywide general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| that the city of Knoxville needs an opportunity and needs to take the responsibility to participate in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4895)|
| 1:21:41| I'll be on my list of topics to discuss with the Mayor-Elect in Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| That's one of the first items to discuss that, and you'll hear that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| We need this step to start the process of really looking ahead for all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4911)|
| 1:21:58| When I say all of Knox County, I mean Knox County outside the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| and Knox County including the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| This is a critical first step to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| I'd be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| Do you all have any questions of them now, or do you want to go ahead and hear from the speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4931)|
| 1:22:17| First person here to speak in favor is Jennifer Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4937)|
| 1:22:32| Here with her aide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| Jennifer, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| Jennifer Roach, Knoxville Area Association of Realtors, 609 Wise Garber Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4958)|
| 1:22:42| Some of my notes are in crayon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| Working mothers work, and we're here and so are our kids sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| Yep, we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| We're here to speak on behalf of the Knoxville Association of Realtors in favor of this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4971)|
| 1:22:57| I think Dr. Lyons and Gerald Green really articulated a lot of the points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4977)|
| 1:23:04| We would make even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| Ours is really for the creativity and innovation of development and future-looking development in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4986)|
| 1:23:14| The microphone is very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| The growth policy plan is really an impediment to the types of development and housing choice that we need in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=4996)|
| 1:23:22| The rural designation, aside from being moot with forest annexation no longer being available to cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5002)|
| 1:23:29| really puts a damper on the type of cluster development or mixed-use type development we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5009)|
| 1:23:35| I've heard arguments to keep the growth policy plan in place as it is, that it would preserve green space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| when actually we think if we take it out of there and remove that impediment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| and allow Knox County a little bit more flexibility in how they do their general plans and other plans in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| that they could do some things where they could cluster development on flat land and preserve slopes and hillsides untouched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5029)|
| 1:23:56| Rather than in these rural designated areas, you're going to have large lots, large houses, very expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5036)|
| 1:24:03| not a lot of housing choice, and you're going to have low density across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| That's not good for the tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| That's the most inefficient use of land we could find from a financial standpoint or an economic or housing needs standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5049)|
| 1:24:16| There's other arguments that we need the growth policy plan in place to take care of infrastructure needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| It hasn't had any teeth in the last 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| It hasn't done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5064)|
| 1:24:25| It hasn't made infrastructure needs happen where they need to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| There are other plans and things in place that we still need to be pushing for those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5068)|
| 1:24:34| but the growth policy plan has no teeth to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| It hasn't in 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| I don't think it's going to in the next 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5078)|
| 1:24:43| A lot of what was mentioned was making sure the city still has a seat at the table to make sure what's going to happen with development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5083)|
| 1:24:50| out in the county or maybe at the city county line and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| There's still the Knox County Commission in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| Every resident has the ability to vote for them and to go and testify and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5097)|
| 1:25:03| The entire planning process is still in place with Knoxville, Knox County planning and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5103)|
| 1:25:08| All the legislative bodies, authorities over the developments are still in place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5108)|
| 1:25:15| We hope you support this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| It really would take away some impediments and provide an opportunity for Knox County to move their development more into the future of the housing choices that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5117)|
| 1:25:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| Thank you, Ms. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| Now to speak against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5130)|
| 1:25:31| First is Lisa Starbuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| Ms. Starbuck, you know the routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| State your name and address and the timer's up above my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| Lisa Starbuck, 6233 Baberly Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| Thank you, Mayor Rojero and council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| I am here today speaking on behalf of the Knox County Planning Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5150)|
| 1:25:55| a coalition of citizens and community groups, representatives that advocate effective planning for future growth in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5155)|
| 1:26:05| We request that you vote to deny Resolution 11J, the Growth Policy Plan Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5165)|
| 1:26:13| We have spent hundreds of hours researching and evaluating every aspect of the Knoxville, Knox County, and Farragut Growth Policy Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5173)|
| 1:26:22| and how it applies to the city, county, and town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5182)|
| 1:26:26| Our group of volunteers have no agenda, no personal interest, and receive no financial or professional gain from our efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5186)|
| 1:26:36| We simply want what is best for all current and future citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5196)|
| 1:26:42| Mayor Jacobs' call to reconvene the Growth Plan Coordinating Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5202)|
| 1:26:47| presented an incredible opportunity for all municipalities to come together and plan for cooperative managed growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5207)|
| 1:26:56| but this opportunity was lost on a lack of misunderstanding of the growth plan and the proposed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5216)|
| 1:27:05| Understandably so, because land use and planning processes are incredibly complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5225)|
| 1:27:12| KCPA would like to thank Mayor Rojero for her thoughtful comments and questions in the Coordinating Committee's final meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5232)|
| 1:27:22| It's obvious that you understand this domain, Mayor Rojero, and made an effort to educate your peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5242)|
| 1:27:31| So here we are, and we would like to empower City Council with some of the information that you need to make a well-informed decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5251)|
| 1:27:41| This proposed amendment was presented as a means to encourage creative mixed use of rural areas by removing density and use restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5261)|
| 1:27:51| In short, literally tearing down farmland fences and putting up hundreds of homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5271)|
| 1:27:57| without ensuring that utilities, water, and other services are economically in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5277)|
| 1:28:03| fragmenting development, and introducing sprawl, which affects you directly and your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5283)|
| 1:28:12| This will open up northeast Knox County, east Knox County, south Knox County, and northwest Knox County to sprawl and substantial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5292)|
| 1:28:21| Sprawl hurts the city in many different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| Development of greenfield instead of infill means higher costs for taxpayers because of increased infrastructure needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5304)|
| 1:28:31| Sprawl development means more cars driving more miles, thus more traffic delays, pollution, longer commutes, and safety risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5311)|
| 1:28:39| Decades of traffic data shows that building on or expanding roads to serve new or existing sprawl only increases congestion through induced demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5319)|
| 1:28:49| Sprawl housing is less affordable because living further from work means you use more of your monthly budget for transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5329)|
| 1:28:57| We have already seen how county development affects the city's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| The city's proposed Washington Pike re-widening project is estimated at $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5342)|
| 1:29:08| More development in the northeast will mean Tazewell Pike and Millartown Pike expansions, which aren't even in the mobility plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5348)|
| 1:29:16| The city taxpayers are going to pay to widen city roads that mostly benefit county residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5356)|
| 1:29:22| The city and county will feel the financial impacts of more stormwater runoff, especially on tributaries to White Creek and First Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5362)|
| 1:29:30| Flooding will get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| The city has already spent millions of dollars on First Creek flood mitigation and can expect to spend millions more because of sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5372)|
| 1:29:41| The city residents can expect more flooding of their homes and businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| Sprawl causes the loss of agricultural lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5386)|
| 1:29:50| If the growth plan doesn't include protections for agricultural lands, there will be fewer local farmers for the downtown farmer's market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5390)|
| 1:29:58| Sprawl impacts our schools, especially in the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| When asked about the road forward, we have been told there will be a revamp of the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5402)|
| 1:30:07| but that's a vague, unfunded promise the county commission did not fund or did not put a timeline on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5407)|
| 1:30:14| There are no guarantees that the strong language in protections in the growth plan for the rural areas would be added to the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5414)|
| 1:30:23| This amendment does not improve coordination with local government, schools, utilities, and services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5423)|
| 1:30:29| While you could view this amendment as wanting to stay in the city's lane, you should also view this as taking down the guardrails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5429)|
| 1:30:37| lane stops, and other barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| Growth creates challenges, or in other words, obstacles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| Will the county swerve into your lane as they try to avoid these obstacles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5443)|
| 1:30:48| How safe does council feel from unplanned transportation and stormwater projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5448)|
| 1:30:53| As both a city and county taxpayer, how safe do you feel from unanticipated budget pressures caused by growth with no offsetting revenue to the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5453)|
| 1:31:05| The rules have been set this way for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| If the county wants to change the rules, they should give something up at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| like an improved general plan that actually implements smart growth and discharges sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| Sorry, but do you need this included, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| But you don't have that in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| If you vote to approve this amendment, you are choosing to remove one of the only ways the city can minimize the impacts and costs from unrestricted development in the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5480)|
| 1:31:30| On behalf of KCPA, I ask you to please deny this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5494)|
| 1:31:35| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5495)|
| 1:31:36| Okay, next is Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5496)|
| 1:31:40| Please state your name and address for the record, and keep an eye on the timer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5500)|
| 1:31:45| Okay, we're back at five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5505)|
| 1:31:46| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| Members of Council, the point of the growth policy plan is to foster smart growth, and this is fundamental to the concept of sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5511)|
| 1:32:03| The growth policy plan is uniquely designed to engage Knox County, the city of Knoxville, the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5523)|
| 1:32:11| in the discussions and decisions regarding development of the Knox County areas designated rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5531)|
| 1:32:18| Those rural designated areas are the most remote, green, undeveloped areas of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5538)|
| 1:32:26| They're not contiguous to city boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| They're well beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| This amendment removes Knoxville from that discussion, and once Knoxville is out, there is no going back, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5552)|
| 1:32:41| Knoxville is out forever from that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5561)|
| 1:32:46| The amendment removes Knoxville by deleting the standards for the areas designated rural from the growth policy plan, so it deletes the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5566)|
| 1:32:58| Removing Knoxville from the deliberation of rural area development does not benefit Knoxville or its taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5578)|
| 1:33:06| Development of rural areas, the extension of sprawl, affects all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5586)|
| 1:33:11| We all pay the cost of expensive infrastructure, school, utility, stormwater, road improvements, air pollution, population shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5591)|
| 1:33:20| Those are the results of sprawl, and they cost all of us, both city taxpayers and county taxpayers, so city taxpayers get to pay twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5600)|
| 1:33:31| Why remove Knoxville forever from these important discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5611)|
| 1:33:38| To be clear, I recognize that there is a need to amend the growth policy plan, but there is a better amendment than the one before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5618)|
| 1:33:50| Changes to the growth policy plan can be accomplished through the growth committee discussions, including the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5630)|
| 1:34:00| Focused on redrawing the planned growth areas where Knox County is expected to have concentrated, intense development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5640)|
| 1:34:11| So by redrawing the planned areas, by expanding the planned growth areas, reducing where reasonable, where smart, the existing rural areas that have the restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5651)|
| 1:34:26| In other words, get out the Sharpie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| So, these would be focused, community-wide discussions, addressing the long-term needs, not the short-term whims,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5669)|
| 1:34:42| and addressing both the benefits and the costs to all parties, and it would include Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5682)|
| 1:34:50| What this is about is protecting Knoxville's assets and limiting its liabilities, limiting its exposures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5690)|
| 1:34:58| For all these reasons, let's try something else first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5698)|
| 1:35:04| This is like the nuclear option, we're out, we're gone, forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5704)|
| 1:35:09| Let's try something first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| It's the Sharpie plan. Get out the Sharpie, put reasonable people together, redraw the lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5712)|
| 1:35:19| Let's get the costs and the benefits of moving the lines, of reducing where necessary, where reasonable, the rural boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5719)|
| 1:35:32| Again, I was on council when the plan was put together and adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| And yes, it takes committed people working hard and working together to come up with a plan that will be adopted by all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5738)|
| 1:35:50| But putting this off, for instance, on the general plan is not something I would encourage for one reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5750)|
| 1:36:00| As you will remember, hillside development, that's in the general plan, and what did we find out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5760)|
| 1:36:07| If those policies aren't codified, they can't be enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5767)|
| 1:36:11| So putting nice words in the general plan gets you nothing but heartbreak down the road when someone says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5771)|
| 1:36:17| why aren't we enforcing those nice words?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| Those nice words have to be codified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| So, again, in the name of smart growth, in the name of protecting our assets and limiting our liabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5784)|
| 1:36:34| protecting the people of the city of Knoxville, I ask that you deny this amendment, go back to the drawing board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5794)|
| 1:36:40| come up with a better way with the Sharpie to make things work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| Council, that's the end of the speakers. Open for discussion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5807)|
| 1:36:53| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| So I think about Fountain City and Alice Bell Spring Hill and the mall area over on the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5815)|
| 1:37:05| When I knocked doors when I was campaigning in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| the number one complaint that I get there, and still today, is traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5829)|
| 1:37:16| And for the council members, I hope you guys remember when the Office of Neighborhoods came and presented to us about traffic calming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5836)|
| 1:37:22| and I said, yay, 4th District is winning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| We have the most applications for traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| We have the most cut-through traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| And some of those were implemented, and the speed humps went in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5851)|
| 1:37:36| And the complaints came from people in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| They were outside the city limits, and they demanded that I have those traffic humps removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5859)|
| 1:37:45| because they slowed them down as they cut through people's neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5865)|
| 1:37:49| Cut-through traffic is a huge problem in Fountain City, and I have conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5869)|
| 1:37:54| Representative Dunn and I have met with Director Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5874)|
| 1:37:59| I've had multiple meetings and complaints and calls from folks in that area, and it is about traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5879)|
| 1:38:05| You have Tazewell and Jacksboro that are two-lane roads handling all the traffic from multiple counties away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5885)|
| 1:38:13| And people want the roads widened, and they want traffic circles, and they want traffic signals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5893)|
| 1:38:21| Recently I got a request of why can't we have a traffic signal there on Tazewell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5901)|
| 1:38:26| and the conversation was about how much it costs and what it takes to get one and why we can't have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| When we talk about how to deal with Jacksboro, how it backs up at Tazewell, that intersection is a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5911)|
| 1:38:39| The only way to deal with these traffic problems, which are not people living within the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5919)|
| 1:38:45| is to take away property and right-of-way and solve those problems, and that in itself is a huge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5925)|
| 1:38:51| Who gets to lose their property and their business so we can solve a traffic problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| that is caused by the folks out in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| You know, we work with those folks, we love those folks, we like them, and that's great that they live out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5938)|
| 1:39:04| but we're the ones, it spills down to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| I've gone to meetings with the 2nd District County Commissioner about the flooding waters that hit the neighborhoods there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5947)|
| 1:39:17| and we have an interesting issue there because we're at the boundary of the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5957)|
| 1:39:22| and the county has different standards for flood water than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| And their answer was to try and, they got me, the only representative from the city that was dumb enough to show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5966)|
| 1:39:34| to try and say that it was somehow our fault and we needed to spend the money to fix, to remedy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5974)|
| 1:39:40| the water coming at us from the development that happened across the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| And the other issue is, sorry, I'm losing my train of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5985)|
| 1:39:54| When you talk about we have a public process and we can voice our opinions, let me tell you how that went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=5994)|
| 1:40:01| I don't think I'm a fancy or special person, but I'm a council rep, so apparently that carries some clout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6001)|
| 1:40:06| And I showed up in, I believe, July 2018 to a county commission meeting and stayed until about midnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6006)|
| 1:40:15| and I was there to support 2nd District Commission Rep, who was opposed to redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6015)|
| 1:40:22| where the property's in the county, but as soon as you leave that property in the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6022)|
| 1:40:26| and by the way, I believe it's on you guys' agenda coming up very soon again for another rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6026)|
| 1:40:32| Everyone in the area is opposed to it for traffic and flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6032)|
| 1:40:37| And so that's my area, and when you leave the development that was asking for the rezone to do higher density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6037)|
| 1:40:44| or to do development at all, you're hitting the city streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| So any improvements to the streets and widening is out of our pocketbook, out of our tax coffers, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6047)|
| 1:40:53| So you get a development in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| We don't get any of the revenues from the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| And I'm there to oppose it, and I was recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6060)|
| 1:41:05| Commissioner Smith was there. I was recognized as being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| Commissioner Carringer recognized that I was there in opposition to support her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| And another commissioner from another district, who voted against her wishes and against our voices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6072)|
| 1:41:19| said, this is the city's problem to figure out the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6079)|
| 1:41:24| That's not our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| So you can sit here and say that we have a voice because we can show up to the public meetings and we can be in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6086)|
| 1:41:33| But then when you're going to get shot down by somebody who's not even in their district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6093)|
| 1:41:38| who can sit there and say, well, that's the city's problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| Make them dig into their pocketbook to solve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| There was the schools issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| There weren't schools to support those extra kids necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| The school that the elementary school would be zoned for was maxed out in both directions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6108)|
| 1:41:53| so you'd have the discussion of which way it was going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| So I don't think this is the right direction to go for these reasons, and I don't support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6116)|
| 1:42:02| There may be something else better to do at the time, but I cannot do this to my constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6122)|
| 1:42:06| and say you have to keep going on these two-lane roads with no voice in the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| And my voice was to show up at that county commission meeting, and I was shot down and ignored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6132)|
| 1:42:17| and told the city should pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6140)|
| 1:42:21| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| So, Gerald, Ms. Malone referenced that there might be other amendments or other suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6142)|
| 1:42:29| Is there anything better than removing this altogether?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6149)|
| 1:42:38| I don't think anybody wants to, from a city standpoint, remove our voice, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6158)|
| 1:42:46| In my opinion, the best route is a comprehensive update of the county general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6166)|
| 1:42:52| and that's where the city has its voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| Going through that route, I think Ms. Malone is correct that a plan is policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6174)|
| 1:43:00| and then our next step would be working together to codify those policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6180)|
| 1:43:05| with development standards in the county and possibly some changes in the city's development standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6185)|
| 1:43:11| So what does that process look like to develop the general plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| What we've mapped out so far in the schedule is the scope of work, the RFQ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6194)|
| 1:43:25| making the RFQ available, soliciting responses, evaluating those responses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6205)|
| 1:43:31| and selecting a consultant, again, by hopefully before the middle of the next calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6211)|
| 1:43:39| That would be an outside-of-the-market, outside-of-Knoxville consultant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6219)|
| 1:43:44| Likely, and likely will be a team, because what we're anticipating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6224)|
| 1:43:49| we also will be updating the county's transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| So this will be the first time that we really look closely at land development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| and transportation at the same time, and as linked as those are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| I think it will be a great opportunity to address some of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6240)|
| 1:44:04| Councilmember Ryder had about how development impacts our transportation network and looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6244)|
| 1:44:09| That process will likely be a year to a year and a half to update those plans and then to codify them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6249)|
| 1:44:15| And where we're receiving, we received some growth pressures close to the city limits all around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6255)|
| 1:44:24| and is starting to move a bit to the north, but Hardin Valley is the apex of the growth challenges in the county now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6264)|
| 1:44:33| and we just completed, in fact, this evening, prior to this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6273)|
| 1:44:39| the council approved a Hardin Valley mobility plan where we're looking at transportation improvements in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6279)|
| 1:44:45| So we are trying to address these problems as they come up in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| and as allocating funds to transportation improvements where the growth necessitates those improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6289)|
| 1:44:56| And there are those locations where the impact of any development doesn't stay within those artificial political boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6296)|
| 1:45:05| They seep over those boundaries, and there is a need for cooperation in addressing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6305)|
| 1:45:10| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6310)|
| 1:45:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6311)|
| 1:45:12| Councilwoman Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| I'm going to try to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| I apologize because I am really losing my voice, but a few questions, Gerald, for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6315)|
| 1:45:23| So is there already some discussion going on with the county and commission and the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6323)|
| 1:45:32| Is there a definite plan for the growth plan update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6332)|
| 1:45:41| Yes, and nearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6341)|
| 1:45:43| And yes, in answer to the first question, there are discussions with the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6343)|
| 1:45:48| and the county mayor's office with regard to schedule and budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| And when the cost, we've developed cost estimates, have contacted consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6351)|
| 1:45:57| letting them know that there will be an RFQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6357)|
| 1:46:00| Those that are looking at national publications have come rank highly for doing this type of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6360)|
| 1:46:06| There has been no, other than the verbal commitment, there's been no vote to allocate the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6366)|
| 1:46:11| but there is a verbal commitment to allocate the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| even to the point of allocating going into this year's county budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| and allocating some funds for the preliminary work of developing the scope of work, the RFQs, the initial outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6378)|
| 1:46:28| On the transportation plan aspect of it, there is a definite allocation of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6388)|
| 1:46:34| The $500,000 of that cost was approved by the TPO executive committee last month, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6394)|
| 1:46:43| I'll look at the mayor because she voted for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6403)|
| 1:46:47| And the county has committed a $150,000 match to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| So that money is assured, and that would be over, well over half, probably three-quarters of the total cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6410)|
| 1:46:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6417)|
| 1:46:58| So I really, the concerns that are being expressed really resonate with me around this concern about sprawl| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6418)|
| 1:47:07| and the effect on our environment and traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| So I share those concerns and have worked on those issues for the 20 years that I've worked in public health prior to coming on city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6432)|
| 1:47:24| But I guess what I've seen happen in our development patterns with this growth policy plan in place is continued sprawl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6444)|
| 1:47:36| development of rural land, strain on our infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6456)|
| 1:47:40| So can you explain how keeping the growth policy plan in place, I guess I'm trying to reconcile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6460)|
| 1:47:47| If what I'm hearing is that this is a stopgap for sprawl, but what I'm seeing is sprawl is continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6467)|
| 1:47:55| Well, the short answer to your question, can I explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6478)|
| 1:47:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6479)|
| 1:48:00| Because you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| With the growth plan in place, what we see is sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| What we need is an engaged community, the county and the city, to address the development patterns that we have in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6484)|
| 1:48:14| sometimes inside the city limits and sometimes outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| And what we need is developers who will step up to the plate and try something different, to be quite honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6497)|
| 1:48:22| And we're putting tools in place that provide the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| And we do have some developers that are looking at another way of developing property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6506)|
| 1:48:33| And there are limitations in the current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6513)|
| 1:48:36| There are some limitations in our current code, and we need to address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6520)|
| 1:48:41| So just a comment, and I'm supporting this, and I don't support sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6521)|
| 1:48:47| I fight against sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| I'll be talking with my county commissioner about this, because I do think it's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6529)|
| 1:48:53| I am a county taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| I am a county voter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6535)|
| 1:48:56| I live in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6536)|
| 1:48:57| I have a voice in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| So I think it's important that all of us express that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6539)|
| 1:49:03| We're in a situation, I feel, and I think that legislative bodies are often in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6543)|
| 1:49:09| where decisions that are made by other legislative bodies directly impact us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6549)|
| 1:49:16| It directly impacts our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| It directly impacts our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| We make those decisions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| We just passed the largest, you know, change in our zoning ordinance in the past 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6563)|
| 1:49:30| And thank goodness, sorry, Commissioner Smith, you're in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6570)|
| 1:49:34| I mean, thank goodness the county did not have to pass that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6574)|
| 1:49:39| That was not, and honestly, I didn't hear from any county commissioners on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6579)|
| 1:49:44| I didn't get pressure from the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| or from that legislative body on a vote that will impact the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6586)|
| 1:49:54| Those speed bumps that you were talking about, I think that was a great example, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6594)|
| 1:50:02| You get a lot of complaints from county residents about that, but they don't get to vote on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| because they live outside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| And sorry, but thank goodness they don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| because if they did, you might not get those speed bump humps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| So I think there are these tensions that are constantly going to happen between legislative bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6617)|
| 1:50:24| and I think we can resolve them by, you know, saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6624)|
| 1:50:30| we refuse to cooperate and we're just going to push forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| Or we could say, you know what, we're going to let your legislative body make plans about your land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6634)|
| 1:50:43| but we're still going to participate in the process by appointing planning commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6643)|
| 1:50:48| and by voting in county elections and by talking and cooperating with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6648)|
| 1:50:53| to make sure that we're moving forward together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| So that's about as much as my voice can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| I respect everybody's opinion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| This is a hard one, but I just wanted to explain why I'm voting in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6660)|
| 1:51:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| Dr. Lyons, if we could interject here for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| I just want to add one point I think that might have gotten a little lost in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6669)|
| 1:51:13| The areas we're speaking of are fairly far away from the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| The vast majority of the county, which is when we're talking about sprawl and some of the concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6677)|
| 1:51:22| is not affected by these rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6682)|
| 1:51:26| To the west end of the county, the Hardin Valley area, and the far east for the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6686)|
| 1:51:32| there's nothing south, for instance, of which I'm aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6692)|
| 1:51:35| Or if there is, it's minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| So I think we wouldn't want to be perceiving as if it was affecting all the county land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6697)|
| 1:51:42| outside the city limits proximate to the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| It's much more likely to cause some of the incidents that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6705)|
| 1:51:48| And conversely, the sprawl that we're speaking of is taking place in all these unaffected areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6708)|
| 1:51:54| So it's a much bigger, broader discussion that I think you outlined very well, Councilman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6714)|
| 1:52:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6720)|
| 1:52:01| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6721)|
| 1:52:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6722)|
| 1:52:03| I also want to recognize that Commissioner Smith is here and thank him for visiting with us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6723)|
| 1:52:09| I'm not sure if there's any other commissioners that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6729)|
| 1:52:13| I have a great deal of respect for what County Commission does and Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6733)|
| 1:52:18| You know, I used to be a Knox County Election Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6738)|
| 1:52:21| So in that small role, I played a part in the county as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6741)|
| 1:52:31| Several items that we've talked about I kind of underlined as we were having this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6751)|
| 1:52:37| And that was about trusting the process and about the impact that would occur in these rural areas we're discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6757)|
| 1:52:49| will have an impact on all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| So I went back and reviewed the state statute that put all this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6771)|
| 1:52:56| And in that, it talks about the county, the town of Farragut, and the city of Knoxville all working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6776)|
| 1:53:04| And I think the reason is because we're all impacted by what happens here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6784)|
| 1:53:08| And so trusting the process, I understand the arguments have been very well stated by my colleagues and by the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6788)|
| 1:53:18| But I think in trusting the process, we have to trust the system that was put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6798)|
| 1:53:23| And so knowing that there's an impact, knowing that there's a process in place for us to discuss this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6803)|
| 1:53:31| to work on it together because it impacts all of us, I just can't support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6811)|
| 1:53:40| Thank you. Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6820)|
| 1:53:42| So when I hear Director Green, you say that there's something in the works with the general plan that might happen next summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6822)|
| 1:53:53| six months plus down the road, that's what you summarized a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6833)|
| 1:53:58| I think my concern is removing ourselves from this process is like putting the cart before the horse because that's not happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6838)|
| 1:54:09| And when we discuss recode as an example, that was not supposed to take nearly as long as it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6849)|
| 1:54:15| And what if the same happens with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| And I'm just not comfortable supporting this before that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| before some alternative or substitute way for us to have a seat at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6860)|
| 1:54:27| or to make sure that some of the things like things that aren't codified like slope and hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6867)|
| 1:54:34| once we remove ourselves from this partnership, we don't get to have a say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| It's not about telling other people what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| It's about being able to be there and voice our concerns about the traffic that we are going, we will get impacted by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6881)|
| 1:54:50| First of all, I'll address the update of the city zoning ordinance taking longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6890)|
| 1:54:56| The consultants and the staff delivered it on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| I didn't place any blame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| I very much value the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6901)|
| 1:55:04| I didn't point fingers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| It's when you, you know, everybody's voice wants to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| It takes a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| Also with regard to what happens in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6911)|
| 1:55:14| the county commission has approved zoning in excess of the density recommended by the, mandated by the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6914)|
| 1:55:22| Nothing happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6922)|
| 1:55:23| What we will do, we'll actually remove a binder that doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6923)|
| 1:55:30| And with the commitment to do a general plan so that we can look at how the county should grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6930)|
| 1:55:35| So I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6935)|
| 1:55:39| That process is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| What process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6942)|
| 1:55:43| You just said the commitment to do a general plan that does work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6943)|
| 1:55:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6946)|
| 1:55:47| It's coming down the pike, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6947)|
| 1:55:48| We have one that doesn't work now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| So again, this is the opportunity to put something in place that will work, that we have a commitment to, that there's a follow-up, that there's implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6950)|
| 1:55:59| Right now we have a general plan that doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6959)|
| 1:56:02| We have a growth policy plan that doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| The county law director has opined on many occasions that the county growth plan is no longer valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6965)|
| 1:56:12| And the county commission takes that advice and votes to approve densities in excess of the, in the rural area in excess of that mandated by the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6972)|
| 1:56:22| So what we have now is totally ineffectual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6982)|
| 1:56:24| This puts us on the track to do something that will benefit the citizens of all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6984)|
| 1:56:33| Well, I will say I looked at the map for the growth plan that's indicated in this, and a huge portion of it is in that northeast sector of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=6993)|
| 1:56:46| And Jacksboro, Tazewell, Washington Pike, and Millard Town and I-640 and I-40 will be incredibly impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7006)|
| 1:56:55| And I've just not, without that general plan process even started and finalized, I don't feel, I feel it's the cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7015)|
| 1:57:03| I don't believe that we're ready to give up the seat at the table at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7027)|
| 1:57:08| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| I think this is another rock in a hard place, hard magnolia tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7031)|
| 1:57:16| But I agree with Councilmember Welch that, you know, I tend to fall in supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7036)|
| 1:57:23| I'm certainly, again, sprawling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| I think one of the really great things about Knoxville, the rural parts of Knox County, you know, east and south and north, and I certainly love them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7045)|
| 1:57:36| But, you know, they're not in the city, so for this body to have sort of preemption over that, I don't think that's the right tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7056)|
| 1:57:44| And we talk about having a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| Well, what this does is saying we've got actually more than a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| We can stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| And I just don't think that's the right setup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| I mean, we're in a metropolitan area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7073)|
| 1:57:56| You know, when we get business in here, well, where do those people work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7076)|
| 1:58:01| A lot of them live and work outside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| A lot of them live and work outside of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| I can't tell you the number of people in my office who live in Blount County or Anderson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7086)|
| 1:58:10| And we've got to be able to work with those partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7090)|
| 1:58:14| I think the best thing the city can do is really, you know, be a leader in terms of smart growth and give examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7094)|
| 1:58:22| I think we're doing that, what we've done downtown, and, you know, show we can do a downtown Burlington and a downtown Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7102)|
| 1:58:29| and show people can live and use public transportation and be that example in the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7109)|
| 1:58:36| And by doing that, hopefully we provide a model for, you know, outside the city and for other counties in the region in our metropolitan area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7116)|
| 1:58:45| So it is a difficult one, and I certainly have the concerns about sprawl and know that it impacts us, but I am supportive of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7125)|
| 1:58:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| This has been a really good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| I want to say I could argue both sides of this personally because I understand both sides of it, as you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7141)|
| 1:59:10| What really, I guess, pushed or tipped the balance, as Councilwoman Welch often says, for me, is some of those same points that Dr. Lyons made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7150)|
| 1:59:21| You know, I sat on that committee with the others and reviewed this and heard from the planning group who's spoken tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7161)|
| 1:59:29| and they've done a tremendous amount of work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| And number one, we have always been strong advocates of local decision making, you know, that we should be in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7171)|
| 1:59:39| I hate when the state comes in and preempts us, and even when we do things like our pilots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7179)|
| 1:59:47| we have to go to county commission to ask for their support, you know, because it affects their tax dollars as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7187)|
| 1:59:54| because ultimately, you know, it's something that's affecting our redevelopment program and it's the work that we've put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7194)|
| 2:00:00| So that's one thing, just the whole idea of the state originally preempting us, telling us what we had to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7200)|
| 2:00:08| and really a lot of it was about the annexations and all in the past, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7208)|
| 2:00:14| And also, as has been said, it puts the city of Knoxville in the position of voting on the regulation of land well outside our boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7214)|
| 2:00:23| And yes, we do understand about the traffic and all, but why are people coming in here from out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7223)|
| 2:00:28| They're coming in to either spend their money at the stores, to go to our recreation activities, to work in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7228)|
| 2:00:38| We need an expanding workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| So even though they're coming in for a reason, it's not just all a cost to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7240)|
| 2:00:45| There's a benefit to us as well in terms of people coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| So I think it's both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7248)|
| 2:00:49| We have to keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| So ultimately, I think that it is true, and I've talked to Mayor Jacobs about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7251)|
| 2:00:58| that if the county, and I've expressed it publicly at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7258)|
| 2:01:02| if the county does not get a handle of this, if they use just to be a free-for-all for whatever development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7262)|
| 2:01:09| any particular developer or realtor or developer or landowner wants to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7269)|
| 2:01:15| then they're going to be in, I won't say the words I actually used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7275)|
| 2:01:19| but they're going to be in really a bad situation because they won't be able to afford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7279)|
| 2:01:25| they won't be able to put schools, they won't be able to afford the roads, the schools, the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7285)|
| 2:01:31| because we know residential development, sprawl residential development does not pay for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7291)|
| 2:01:39| And all of us are subsidizing when that happens as county taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7299)|
| 2:01:44| But I also know that I heard Mayor Jacobs say the words smart growth, which I've never heard, or rarely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7304)|
| 2:01:51| I've never heard a county mayor say that, and rarely from county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7311)|
| 2:01:56| So I think he understands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7316)|
| 2:02:00| And they don't raise their taxes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| They don't raise taxes very often out in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7323)|
| 2:02:06| It's been many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7326)|
| 2:02:08| So this commission and this county mayor has to face the fact that if you let sprawl continue like it has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7328)|
| 2:02:18| where it's allowed now, and you open up rural areas to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7338)|
| 2:02:23| you're going to be in a worse situation than they are right now in terms of being able to pay for the amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7343)|
| 2:02:29| the infrastructure, the education, you know, the needs of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7349)|
| 2:02:35| So they have a pretty big burden on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7355)|
| 2:02:38| And as county taxpayers, I think we all have a responsibility to be a part of that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7358)|
| 2:02:47| And even as a city and as a city council, I think we should be part of that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7367)|
| 2:02:53| But I don't think that we need to be in a position of voting on that future plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7373)|
| 2:03:01| I think that's the prerogative of the legislative body and the elected officials who are responsible for those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7381)|
| 2:03:13| who would typically vote on the rezoning or on the plan for their own area that they are responsible for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7393)|
| 2:03:19| any more than we want them voting on stuff that we're responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7399)|
| 2:03:23| And so I think it's, on one hand, we could say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7403)|
| 2:03:27| we're not going to opt to get out of this until you prove that you can develop a general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7407)|
| 2:03:33| and that is acceptable to us and address these concerns we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| That's one thing we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7417)|
| 2:03:39| On the other hand, we could say, this is how we feel, these are the issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7419)|
| 2:03:44| and we are going to allow the legislative body and the administration who is ultimately responsible for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7424)|
| 2:03:52| by law, that's their responsibility to vote on those rezonings and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7432)|
| 2:03:57| we're going to give you the authority, we're going to opt out of what was given to us a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7437)|
| 2:04:02| And I fall on that ladder, that we should not just trust County Commission and the County Administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7442)|
| 2:04:14| but be actively engaged in those discussions, the next administration, the next council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7454)|
| 2:04:20| and vote to approve this, knowing that Gerald and the planning staff are on top of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7460)|
| 2:04:29| they've been working, I know he was very much a part of all these discussions that we had as a policy committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7469)|
| 2:04:35| growth policy committee, and that he will continue to raise these issues as well as this council being able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7475)|
| 2:04:45| It's not perfect either way, but that's the reason why we brought this to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7485)|
| 2:04:50| I voted for it at the growth policy committee, and that's why we're bringing it to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7490)|
| 2:04:58| So, Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7498)|
| 2:05:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7501)|
| 2:05:02| I don't believe that keeping this going implies that there's a lack of trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7502)|
| 2:05:09| I think that the city and the county's fate is tied together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7509)|
| 2:05:13| So, having more people at the table just gives more opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7513)|
| 2:05:17| So, it's something that I want to stay in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7517)|
| 2:05:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7522)|
| 2:05:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7523)|
| 2:05:24| So, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| I think we probably need to do a roll call on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7526)|

| 2:05:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7551)|
| 2:05:52| Okay, the motion passes five to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7552)|
| 2:05:56| Again, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7556)|
| 2:05:58| Really good discussion, and we'll move forward working with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7558)|
| 2:06:05| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7565)|
| 2:06:09| 11K is the resolution, amending resolution number R-326-2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7569)|

| 2:06:35| the public purposes of the board as defined in Tennessee Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7595)|

| 2:06:43| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7603)|
| 2:06:44| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7604)|
| 2:06:45| Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7605)|
| 2:06:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7606)|
| 2:06:47| Is there a representative here from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7607)|
| 2:06:51| Is Johnny Miller here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7611)|
| 2:06:54| Oh, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7614)|
| 2:06:55| Mr. Miller, yeah, here you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7615)|
| 2:06:59| Please state your name and address for the record, Mr. Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7619)|
| 2:07:05| Johnny Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7625)|
| 2:07:06| We're at 1919 Tennessee Avenue is where our plan is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| Thanks, Mr. Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7630)|
| 2:07:11| I just had a couple of questions about the number of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7631)|
| 2:07:15| There's reference to the number of projects that will be created through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7635)|
| 2:07:21| but how many jobs are you estimating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7641)|
| 2:07:24| and what kind of salary or hourly wage would you anticipate those jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7644)|
| 2:07:30| Right now we have 340 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7650)|
| 2:07:34| The average wage, good wage, is $26 an hour with benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7654)|
| 2:07:40| And we also have contractors and a fabrication shop on our site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7660)|
| 2:07:45| so each day we have over 300 people working on our site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7665)|
| 2:07:49| We do also have trucks coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7669)|
| 2:07:52| We have probably over 100 trucks delivering material and steel to our site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7672)|
| 2:07:57| Those are also jobs we're affecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| And we send parts constantly to local machine shops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| and use local supplies for hoses, bearings, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7682)|
| 2:08:06| because we spend a lot of maintenance dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7686)|
| 2:08:08| because we're a heavy equipment manufacturing plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7690)|
| 2:08:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7691)|
| 2:08:12| So one of the things that's referenced in the materials that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7692)|
| 2:08:15| is the additional projects that will be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7695)|
| 2:08:19| Will there be additional jobs in addition to the 240-ish positions that you currently employ?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7699)|
| 2:08:27| With the five-year plan, we're planning on adding nine jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7707)|
| 2:08:32| but we want to sustain our competitive position, and we want to improve it eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7712)|
| 2:08:37| So we do want to sustain the market share we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7717)|
| 2:08:41| and we believe when this is over there will be an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7721)|
| 2:08:44| to try to get more market share from our own plants outside of our state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| and from other steel mills outside of our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7727)|
| 2:08:52| But the current plan is to add nine jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7732)|
| 2:08:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7741)|
| 2:09:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7743)|
| 2:09:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7745)|
| 2:09:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7746)|
| 2:09:07| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7747)|
| 2:09:08| Thank you, Mr. Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7748)|
| 2:09:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7749)|

| 2:09:54| to be redeveloped as a small-scale manufacturing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7794)|
| 2:09:57| or artist maker space for a sales price of $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7797)|
| 2:10:01| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7801)|
| 2:10:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7802)|
| 2:10:03| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7803)|
| 2:10:04| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7804)|
| 2:10:06| So, Dawn, our packet said that you had two proposals on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7806)|
| 2:10:11| and I just kind of wanted to know what the other proposal was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7811)|
| 2:10:14| and sometimes we get that information, sometimes we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7814)|
| 2:10:17| But, I mean, you're selling it quite a bit below appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| I can make arguments why we can't sell it for appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| I can make an argument why it's worth more, but I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7824)|
| 2:10:29| But I just kind of wanted to know when it's centered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| and we're selling it quite a bit less than appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7834)|
| 2:10:35| I'm Michelle Foster, Director, Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7835)|
| 2:10:38| This project here has a lot of history to it, if you don't mind me saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7838)|
| 2:10:43| Going back to where we first did the Magnolia Avenue presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7843)|
| 2:10:47| when we had design plans out in the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7847)|
| 2:10:50| there was a concern for small businesses and the lack thereof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7850)|
| 2:10:53| or maybe future displacement based on what the streetscape project would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7853)|
| 2:11:01| We kept a pulse on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| Back in 2017, I believe, Smart Growth America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7863)|
| 2:11:06| we applied for technical assistance to help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7866)|
| 2:11:09| to kind of keep a pulse on the small business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| and the maker community, Knoxville being an Etsy maker city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7872)|
| 2:11:17| We won that grant and had the Smart Growth America technical team come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7877)|
| 2:11:22| and have discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| I think you were part of that discussions and workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7885)|
| 2:11:28| to create opportunities for small businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| and we wanted that focus to be on the Magnolia Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7891)|
| 2:11:33| the warehouse district in that area there to help spur economic vitality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7893)|
| 2:11:40| and economic development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| When we did that, it gave us the opportunity to look at a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7903)|
| 2:11:47| that sat vacant and blighted that was owned by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7907)|
| 2:11:52| That recommendation then led forth this opportunity to take a city-owned property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7912)|
| 2:11:58| and try to put it back into reuse for the maker community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7918)|
| 2:12:03| Again, supporting Mary Harrell's initiative to build a strong community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7923)|
| 2:12:08| and support maker community and create jobs in the area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7928)|
| 2:12:13| So that set the stage for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| With that, we went through several proposals, but what we did first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7936)|
| 2:12:21| we partnered with the Knoxville Entrepreneur Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| I think Jim Biggs may still be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7944)|
| 2:12:26| Not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7946)|
| 2:12:27| He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7947)|
| 2:12:28| And also Lisa Duncan, also the Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7948)|
| 2:12:31| because being a CDFI and dealing with small business loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7951)|
| 2:12:34| we wanted to involve them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7954)|
| 2:12:36| and, of course, our community development department as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7956)|
| 2:12:39| So we partnered with them, and with the Entrepreneur Center's help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7959)|
| 2:12:44| we created this grand open house at the site where 60 to 70 makers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7964)|
| 2:12:51| and participants showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7971)|
| 2:12:53| We gave them a tour of the building to create this great synergy along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7973)|
| 2:13:00| with developers that were there, and we gave them a tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7980)|
| 2:13:03| We gave them some background on this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| So that kind of set the stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7986)|
| 2:13:10| We went through several RFP processes over this three-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7990)|
| 2:13:15| and I think I have the dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7995)|
| 2:13:18| We had one back in ‑‑ our first one was July 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=7998)|
| 2:13:23| We had no responses from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| Plenty of makers, but no developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8005)|
| 2:13:27| And then second, we put out a second RFP January 2019 with no response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8007)|
| 2:13:35| and then we kept pushing it out because we kept hearing from makers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8015)|
| 2:13:40| that we really want to see something happen to this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8020)|
| 2:13:44| so we were not going to give up and have that public building sit there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8024)|
| 2:13:48| bringing no tax dollars to the tax row, sit there empty and blighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8028)|
| 2:13:52| and not keep pursuing the opportunity for makers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8032)|
| 2:13:55| So that's when we put out the third RFP and got two proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8035)|
| 2:14:00| one which was with Dewhurst Properties with a purchase price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8040)|
| 2:14:05| and the other with Hatcher Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| Mr. Hill, his objective was to create ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8047)|
| 2:14:14| he had a letter of interest with Finish Point Custom Cavendish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8054)|
| 2:14:20| which is a local business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8060)|
| 2:14:23| They're also located on, I believe, Western and University,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8063)|
| 2:14:29| and this would have been a second‑place business for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| And then Mr. Dewhurst had a proposal for 19 studio spaces for makers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8072)|
| 2:14:38| which was the initiative, and of course with the evaluation committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8078)|
| 2:14:42| was a better proposal based on what we were looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8082)|
| 2:14:44| in supporting Mary Harrell's initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8084)|
| 2:14:47| So that's why we selected that proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8087)|
| 2:14:51| I hope that gets you what you were asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8091)|
| 2:14:54| And so his proposal was for how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8094)|
| 2:14:59| He had a purchase price of $175,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8099)|
| 2:15:02| but it was for just a business extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8102)|
| 2:15:06| a second business, locally owned business in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8106)|
| 2:15:10| not supporting makers and not ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8110)|
| 2:15:14| and it was ‑‑ I guess it didn't meet the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8114)|
| 2:15:17| by the evaluation team very highly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8117)|
| 2:15:20| even though we did understand it would have been a new business in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8120)|
| 2:15:24| Small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8124)|
| 2:15:25| Small business in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8125)|
| 2:15:26| Higher price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8126)|
| 2:15:28| So why give him three years to do the construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8128)|
| 2:15:32| We were negotiating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8132)|
| 2:15:35| And $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8135)|
| 2:15:36| I mean, he discounted the price very significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8136)|
| 2:15:38| He gets three years to do the construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8138)|
| 2:15:41| but he has a 10‑year restriction on the use of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8141)|
| 2:15:44| He has a 10‑year restriction on the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8144)|
| 2:15:46| And we went back and forth on that, but that's just how negotiations go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8146)|
| 2:15:50| We were trying to get the best effort with Mr. Dewhurst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8150)|
| 2:15:55| And he's here if you wanted to talk to David Dewhurst and Mark Hines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| but we wanted to get the best deal and negotiation for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8159)|
| 2:16:02| knowing that we were going to get makerspace out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8162)|
| 2:16:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8169)|
| 2:16:10| So it's 10 years from now or 10 years from the end of his construction period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8170)|
| 2:16:14| Ten years from the closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| I think he has two years, three years of construction, and then he ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8177)|
| 2:16:21| That's 10 years from closing, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8181)|
| 2:16:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8185)|
| 2:16:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8189)|
| 2:16:31| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8191)|
| 2:16:33| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8193)|
| 2:16:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8194)|
| 2:16:35| Director Foster, you know, the only question I had gotten on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8195)|
| 2:16:40| was about whether this was an open process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8200)|
| 2:16:43| And so I think you've already addressed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| But just for the record, I want to ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| It was an open process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8208)|
| 2:16:49| Very open process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8209)|
| 2:16:50| We went through our procurement services through our purchasing department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8210)|
| 2:16:53| and we, as I mentioned before, we had three RFP proposals out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8213)|
| 2:16:59| and went through the steps with the deadlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8219)|
| 2:17:02| And also, even though we had the open house with the makers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8222)|
| 2:17:06| those that had missed the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8226)|
| 2:17:08| there was an ample opportunity to just call the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8228)|
| 2:17:11| call the purchasing department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8231)|
| 2:17:13| Penny Owens was there with the keys to go out on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8233)|
| 2:17:16| to let interested buyers explore the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8236)|
| 2:17:19| and tour the building on their own at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8239)|
| 2:17:22| We made as much availability as we could with the calls that came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8242)|
| 2:17:29| to tour the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8249)|
| 2:17:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8250)|
| 2:17:31| And then can you give us a little bit of a discussion about the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8251)|
| 2:17:35| that was used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8255)|
| 2:17:37| So based on the criteria base, we had each proposal had to have a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8257)|
| 2:17:44| based on a point total, then financial capacity, qualifications and experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8264)|
| 2:17:50| and then a proposed development timeline for construction and then build out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8270)|
| 2:17:56| And then, of course, a property purchase price was also added for a total of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8276)|
| 2:18:01| I think you had to add up to 100 points for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8281)|
| 2:18:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8284)|
| 2:18:05| And let Mr. Evans, our Deputy Director of Finance, discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8285)|
| 2:18:11| Boyce Evans, Deputy Director of Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8291)|
| 2:18:13| Yeah, the evaluation criteria were the same for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8293)|
| 2:18:18| You had 40 points for the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8298)|
| 2:18:21| Financial capacity was 18 points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8301)|
| 2:18:26| Qualification and experience, 20 points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8306)|
| 2:18:28| Proposed development timeline, 10 points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8308)|
| 2:18:31| And the purchase price was 10 points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8311)|
| 2:18:35| And essentially what you came down to was roughly a 4.7-point difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8315)|
| 2:18:40| between Dewhurst Properties and Hatcher Hill on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8320)|
| 2:18:46| And, you know, in requests for proposals where you are developing property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8326)|
| 2:18:57| the most important, just like the Supreme Court site over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8337)|
| 2:19:02| the most important thing, since we own it, is oftentimes the development plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8342)|
| 2:19:10| That's why, I mean, the point spread worked out on the price such that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8350)|
| 2:19:19| Hatcher Hill maxed out on the 10 points there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8359)|
| 2:19:23| as opposed to I think it was 5.7 points that Dewhurst got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8363)|
| 2:19:28| But on the development plan itself, which had the most points with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8368)|
| 2:19:34| Dewhurst got 39 points as opposed to Hatcher Hill's 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8374)|
| 2:19:39| And these criteria were in place, clearly stated in the request for proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8379)|
| 2:19:46| and it more or less got what we wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8386)|
| 2:19:53| which is the development of the property in the way that we want it to be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8393)|
| 2:19:57| to support the maker community and the economic development of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8397)|
| 2:20:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8402)|
| 2:20:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8403)|
| 2:20:04| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| Oh, well, I turned mine on and off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8406)|
| 2:20:08| so I don't know if I'm in line in front of Councilwoman McKenzie or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8408)|
| 2:20:13| Boyce, before you sit down, can you just elaborate for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8413)|
| 2:20:19| So, to be clear, listening to the point spread,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8419)|
| 2:20:22| 40 points for development, 18 points for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8422)|
| 2:20:25| I've already forgotten what the 18 points was for, 20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8425)|
| 2:20:28| Financial capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8428)|
| 2:20:29| Financial capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8429)|
| 2:20:32| And then 20 points for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8432)|
| 2:20:35| 20 points qualification experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8437)|
| 2:20:38| And then 10 points for timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8438)|
| 2:20:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8440)|
| 2:20:41| So, basically, where the bulk of the emphasis, the 40-point emphasis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8441)|
| 2:20:46| was on what we wanted, what the RFP wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8446)|
| 2:20:50| Yes, ma'am, what we wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8450)|
| 2:20:52| Which was not market value or a small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8452)|
| 2:20:55| It was makers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| That was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8459)|
| 2:21:01| It was proposed use geared toward the maker community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8461)|
| 2:21:07| versus the other proposal from Hatcher Hill for offices in a showroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8467)|
| 2:21:13| I mean, that's what it came down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8473)|
| 2:21:17| That's what we wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8477)|
| 2:21:21| And the timeline of allowing it to be a makerspace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8481)|
| 2:21:24| and become is hinged at 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8484)|
| 2:21:28| That was not part of the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8488)|
| 2:21:30| That was part of the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8490)|
| 2:21:32| Ms. Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8492)|
| 2:21:34| Oftentimes we have a reversionary clause in them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8494)|
| 2:21:36| but I don't know if it was in this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8496)|
| 2:21:40| The 10 years for it to be a makerspace and go to any use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8500)|
| 2:21:45| Part of the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8505)|
| 2:21:46| That was part of the RFP or the RFQ?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8506)|
| 2:21:49| Part of the agreement when we sat down with Mr. Duhart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8509)|
| 2:21:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8512)|
| 2:21:53| So that came later in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8515)|
| 2:21:56| I will say, in a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8516)|
| 2:21:58| I feel like we're stuck between a rock and a magnolia again here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8518)|
| 2:22:03| Marshall's joke of the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8523)|
| 2:22:08| I have to respect the process, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8528)|
| 2:22:10| because we don't, as council, get to set the RFQ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8530)|
| 2:22:14| and the emphasis was not on getting money out of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8534)|
| 2:22:18| but getting a particular use out of it to settle the requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8538)|
| 2:22:23| or the categorization that we're an Etsy makers city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8543)|
| 2:22:28| If I could just intervene here for a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8548)|
| 2:22:30| before I call on the other two council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8550)|
| 2:22:32| We are known, and I don't get involved in procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8552)|
| 2:22:37| I don't get involved in the selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8557)|
| 2:22:39| That's set up through our procurement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8559)|
| 2:22:43| through our purchasing department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8563)|
| 2:22:45| and through our offices who are managing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8565)|
| 2:22:47| But the purpose was, and as she said, this was the third attempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8567)|
| 2:22:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8570)|
| 2:22:51| And after the second attempt, and it wasn't successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8571)|
| 2:22:54| I know we had a discussion about it, and I said, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| we are known as the maker city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8577)|
| 2:22:59| We have a very active maker community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8579)|
| 2:23:02| We have been purposeful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8582)|
| 2:23:04| and many of you have gone to different activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| We established the Mayor's Maker Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8586)|
| 2:23:09| We have KEC and Jim Biggs and his team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8589)|
| 2:23:12| who work actively with the maker community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8592)|
| 2:23:15| And in places, and I've gone around the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8595)|
| 2:23:18| in my mayor trips and conferences and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8598)|
| 2:23:22| and the Kauffman Foundation, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8602)|
| 2:23:24| who has held a conference here in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8604)|
| 2:23:26| they're actively promoting entrepreneurship and makers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8606)|
| 2:23:30| And so we had a city-owned building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8610)|
| 2:23:34| that we had the opportunity to create a makerspace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8614)|
| 2:23:41| And so that was our goal, to create a makerspace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8621)|
| 2:23:44| to help build this maker community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8624)|
| 2:23:46| A lot of our smaller, you know, startups and such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8626)|
| 2:23:51| who have a hard time finding other space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8631)|
| 2:23:55| And so that was the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| And so it wasn't to have the highest return on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8637)|
| 2:24:00| because if that was the goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8640)|
| 2:24:02| we would have written a different RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8642)|
| 2:24:04| You know, we would have just put it on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8644)|
| 2:24:06| We probably wouldn't even have an RFP, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8646)|
| 2:24:08| But we do RFPs because there's something special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8648)|
| 2:24:11| There's a certain way that we want this property developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8651)|
| 2:24:14| to meet a larger goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8654)|
| 2:24:16| And so that is why we are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8656)|
| 2:24:21| because the committee decided that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| based on the goal that we had set for that space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8663)|
| 2:24:26| and our commitment to the maker community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8666)|
| 2:24:28| this was a more responsive bid or proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8668)|
| 2:24:33| Nothing against the other one that came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8673)|
| 2:24:36| but it wasn't as responsive as what we were looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8676)|
| 2:24:40| And that's why this is the proposal before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8680)|
| 2:24:43| And just to clarify, it was never put on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8683)|
| 2:24:46| It was always put out the three times for RFQ or P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8686)|
| 2:24:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8690)|
| 2:24:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8691)|
| 2:24:52| When we were looking, she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8692)|
| 2:24:53| supporting small businesses in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8693)|
| 2:24:55| creating a maker space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| seeing what other communities had done that was progressive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8697)|
| 2:25:00| in terms of supporting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| we knew that we had an opportunity because we own this space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8702)|
| 2:25:05| and that was the purpose of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| not to get the most return on the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| but to get future returns by helping the maker community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8709)|
| 2:25:14| and these individual businesses grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8714)|
| 2:25:17| Voting against this does not approve the alternative proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8717)|
| 2:25:21| It would just start the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8721)|
| 2:25:24| Again, the only proposal is the one in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8724)|
| 2:25:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8729)|
| 2:25:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8730)|
| 2:25:31| Thanks for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8731)|
| 2:25:32| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8732)|
| 2:25:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8733)|
| 2:25:34| So just some clarification on the objective and the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8734)|
| 2:25:37| So if the goal was we really wanted to have an emphasis on maker space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8737)|
| 2:25:41| that was what our goal was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| Should Mr. Hill's proposal have just been disqualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8743)|
| 2:25:47| because it really didn't fit in the scope of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8747)|
| 2:25:50| I guess I'm just kind of wondering why his even went through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8750)|
| 2:25:55| Well, I guess you could argue that that is one business that makes things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8755)|
| 2:26:01| So he has a maker business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8761)|
| 2:26:03| So I wouldn't say it would be disqualified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8763)|
| 2:26:06| but I guess in weighing and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8766)|
| 2:26:08| because I wasn't there in the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8768)|
| 2:26:11| he's got one maker versus 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8771)|
| 2:26:14| Occasionally we do put out a request for proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8774)|
| 2:26:18| where it will have some pass-fail criteria up front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8778)|
| 2:26:22| where if you don't pass certain things you get put in the leave it alone pile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8782)|
| 2:26:28| This wasn't one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8788)|
| 2:26:30| So if you don't put that pass-fail criteria in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8790)|
| 2:26:33| you're pretty much obligated to go ahead and evaluate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8793)|
| 2:26:36| And, frankly, he did good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8796)|
| 2:26:39| Their proposal was good in a lot of the areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8799)|
| 2:26:42| If we hadn't had that other proposal, I don't know where we might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8802)|
| 2:26:49| And so in the process, when you put in your RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8809)|
| 2:26:52| you are to just put in your bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8812)|
| 2:26:55| So it is not advertised that the $100,000 is the threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8815)|
| 2:27:00| for what we want to sell the property for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8820)|
| 2:27:02| The RFP just requires the applicant to put in a bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8822)|
| 2:27:06| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8826)|
| 2:27:08| They submit a proposal, and in that proposal they do have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8828)|
| 2:27:12| and they did have to in this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8832)|
| 2:27:14| say what their purchase price of the property was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8834)|
| 2:27:17| And that was evaluated relative to the other purchase price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8837)|
| 2:27:21| that were received by the National Institute of Government Purchasing's formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8841)|
| 2:27:26| where you compare the two prices to one another and have a point spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8846)|
| 2:27:31| And then they were basically graded on all the other factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8851)|
| 2:27:37| And then my other question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8857)|
| 2:27:39| so on the agreed upon 10-year commitment, does that 10-year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8859)|
| 2:27:44| and I think this question was asked earlier and I kind of missed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8864)|
| 2:27:47| does that 10-year agreement slash commitment start at the date of closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8867)|
| 2:27:52| or does it start after all of the construction is completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8872)|
| 2:27:58| and the property is ready to be leased out or used for the maker space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8878)|
| 2:28:15| It says redevelopment of the property shall commence within 12 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8895)|
| 2:28:18| following the conveyance of the property to the purchaser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8898)|
| 2:28:24| Pull your microphone closer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8904)|
| 2:28:27| It says redevelopment of the property shall commence within 12 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8907)|
| 2:28:30| following the conveyance of the property to the purchaser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8910)|
| 2:28:34| after you complete the years of construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8914)|
| 2:28:38| And the years of construction, did I hear someone say that it was up to three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8918)|
| 2:28:41| Up to three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8921)|
| 2:28:43| And so with that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8923)|
| 2:28:45| and hopefully it wouldn't take that long for this project to be completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8925)|
| 2:28:49| but there's the potential that three of those 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8929)|
| 2:28:52| could go to just the construction phase of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8932)|
| 2:28:55| which actually wouldn't give us 10 years with the initial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8935)|
| 2:29:00| and meeting the goal that we had for the maker space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8940)|
| 2:29:11| I just think the three years sounds like a really long amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8951)|
| 2:29:15| I want to ask Mr. Dewhurst to come forward and talk about the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8955)|
| 2:29:19| So I'm confused here, Donna Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8959)|
| 2:29:22| You're still looking for when the 10-year starts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8962)|
| 2:29:24| Chances are a lot of times when a CO or a certificate of occupancy starts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8964)|
| 2:29:30| we'll probably start the clock when the building, the 10-year would count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8970)|
| 2:29:35| We could probably look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| It says closing date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8977)|
| 2:29:39| It's very specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8979)|
| 2:29:40| It says closing date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8980)|
| 2:29:42| Restriction period means the 10 consecutive years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8982)|
| 2:29:44| immediately following the closing date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8984)|
| 2:29:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8987)|
| 2:29:48| It's pretty clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8988)|
| 2:29:52| So with that said, and I don't know if this is already just cut and dry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8992)|
| 2:29:55| and the ink is dried on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8995)|
| 2:29:57| but I would ask if there's any way that we could extend that commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=8997)|
| 2:30:02| to 15 years or 13 years to give us a little bit more capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9002)|
| 2:30:07| given the construction phase of this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9007)|
| 2:30:11| Mr. Dewhurst, you may want to speak to what the scope of that construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9011)|
| 2:30:15| looks like and why it could potentially take up to three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9015)|
| 2:30:26| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9026)|
| 2:30:27| David Dewhurst, 133 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9027)|
| 2:30:30| First of all, let me say, I wasn't even, I guess, fully aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9030)|
| 2:30:35| Three years, I'm not sure why that particular date got in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9035)|
| 2:30:40| This is not a large building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9040)|
| 2:30:41| It's not going to take three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9041)|
| 2:30:44| We do plan on starting with it expeditiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9044)|
| 2:30:48| It is, these days, getting a permit from the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9048)|
| 2:30:52| is not the easiest thing in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9052)|
| 2:30:54| It takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9054)|
| 2:30:57| I can tell you right now we're restoring the facade of a building on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9057)|
| 2:31:04| That is taking probably four to five times longer than we anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9064)|
| 2:31:08| because of the structural conditions of this 125-year-old brick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9068)|
| 2:31:13| that we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9073)|
| 2:31:15| You run into things a lot of times that are unknown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9075)|
| 2:31:18| when you talk about restoring an old building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9078)|
| 2:31:21| This building is not nearly as old as the ones that we're used to dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9081)|
| 2:31:25| We don't anticipate there being significant problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9085)|
| 2:31:30| I'm extraordinarily confident that we'll have this done well before three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9090)|
| 2:31:36| If it takes that long, I'll be personally sort of embarrassed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9096)|
| 2:31:40| that we can't get it done faster than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9100)|
| 2:31:42| I'm happy to actually shorten that time period if that's helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9102)|
| 2:31:46| because we don't want the building to sit there in its current condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9106)|
| 2:31:50| any longer than it needs to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9110)|
| 2:31:53| So I'm happy to accelerate that time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9113)|
| 2:31:56| Would you be agreeable to consider extending the commitment date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9116)|
| 2:32:03| When you refer to the commitment date, you refer to the 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9123)|
| 2:32:06| The 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9126)|
| 2:32:08| Let me tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9128)|
| 2:32:09| Anytime you get into a building that we're dedicating a use, in this case, to makers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9129)|
| 2:32:18| These are very non-capitalized kind of start-ups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9138)|
| 2:32:21| It's very small little start-ups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9141)|
| 2:32:23| It's pretty difficult to plan ahead and say that this concept is, by God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9143)|
| 2:32:27| solid for the next decade plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9147)|
| 2:32:31| I will tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9151)|
| 2:32:33| It's funny, I'm sitting here with Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9153)|
| 2:32:34| Tim's my partner on a couple projects downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9154)|
| 2:32:36| and we ended up competing on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9156)|
| 2:32:39| I didn't know this until tonight, but Tim had a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9159)|
| 2:32:43| it sounds like a capitalized tenant to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9163)|
| 2:32:48| Undoubtedly, if that's what the city had called for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9168)|
| 2:32:51| and had we gone out and solicited one, I probably would have offered more money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9171)|
| 2:32:57| and the restriction period would have been very different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9177)|
| 2:32:59| for a concept of a single tenant for a building like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9179)|
| 2:33:03| We're talking about, you know, 19 different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9183)|
| 2:33:08| I talked to Mr. Barker yesterday about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9188)|
| 2:33:11| I called him, you know, these pretty creative cats we're putting in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9191)|
| 2:33:16| There's a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9196)|
| 2:33:17| They're not paying a whole lot for this space, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265191119?start=9197)|
