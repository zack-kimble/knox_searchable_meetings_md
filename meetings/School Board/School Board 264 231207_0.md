| 0:18:43| Thank you, Madam Chair. I just want to say thank you to Gary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| for, I had a couple requests for changes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| I'm glad that they accepted the change to 90 business days for giving us notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| whether they're moving or not, or if that were to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| One thing I do want to bring up that they were not in agreeance with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| that maybe Mr. Myers could provide some clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| Going back to Section 2.33, Cost for Special Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1152)|
| 0:19:20| where we were talking about where in that process that they assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| responsibility, and this, the last line of the first paragraph says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| the Charter School's financial obligation begins once a student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| has an IEP, and it seemed kind of like in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| conversation on Monday that their responsibility is, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| financial responsibility is before that, so I had requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| that the potential change would be the Charter School's financial obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| begins once a student has been suspected of needing student supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| and or special education interventions, and they were not in agreement to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| change. Mr. Myers, could you speak again to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| kind of like what that process is, like when they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| when they're suspected, like what they will have to pay for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| I think maybe I didn't understand, like where the Charter School's financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| obligation really does start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| Sure, thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Ms. Byk, for the question. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| Mr. Duplan and I actually talked about this subsection of the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| as it is specific to special education, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| I think to help clear some of this up, so once a student is suspected of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| having an educational disability, that student and family then have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| protections afforded to them under those procedural rights and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| safeguards. That's very different than actually receiving the special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| education services, right? So the cost that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| encumbered based on a particular special education service doesn't actually start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| until the child is identified as having that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| having that educational disability. So that is, I think, why that language is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| that way and Mr. Duplan can, if I haven't done a good job explaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| that, Mr. Duplan can weigh in, but it's my understanding based on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| way this subsection is designed that what they're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| basically what they're saying is once we've identified that the student does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| in fact qualify for special education services, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| the Charter School would be responsible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| the financial obligation to deliver those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| This specifically says IEP, so I was a little confused on if students have 504s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| Is there a cost when students have 504s to the district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1283)|
| 0:21:30| So if a Charter School student has a 504 plan, there would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| no specific cost associated with that to the district. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| section 504 of the ADA does not have a funding element, which is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| pretty significant difference between that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1304)|

| 0:22:09| there would be no specific cost to our district to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| help them implement a 504 plan. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1332)|
| 0:22:21| Is there any other discussion? And just for a point of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| since Ms. Christy made the motion on this, Ms. Christy, will you clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| which version you're moving to approve? The 11.3 version and the 12.6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1348)|

| 0:22:37| mean the the 12.6 version. Okay, I just wanted to clarify that for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1357)|
| 0:22:43| Okay, so if we do not have any more discussion on this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| Ms. Coatney, will you do a roll call vote, please? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| Dr. Bettler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1374)|

| 0:23:15| Dr. Bettler, would you like to change your pass vote? Ms. Byke, would you like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| to change yours? Madam Chair, that's five yes votes, one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1398)|

| 0:23:54| Hi, everyone. My name is Janiyah Holland. I'm sure some of you might know my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| You've seen my email. You've seen the news article this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| So I'm here today to discuss the incident that happened at West Haven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| Elementary when my four-year-old child was placed in a storage closet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| for breaking pencils and crayons. Don't know who's aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1451)|
| 0:24:18| Haven't heard from anyone when I sent the message out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| majority of these people sitting up here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| Since then, we have put a behavior plan in place for him to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| be positive reinforcements, and he was also placed in a pack room Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| I have now had to withdraw my son and get him evaluated by Helen Ross-McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| as he is traumatized. Nobody can give me answers. Nobody can tell me why he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| placed in there other than breaking pencils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| Nobody has documentation. Nobody can tell me how many times he has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| been placed in there. I reached out to multiple people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| Your assistant superintendent reached out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| Student Success Choice has not reached out to me. I didn't need anyone to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| contact with Beth Lackey because I had already contacted her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| She has said in the meeting nothing has been done, but she has said in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| meeting. Also, so I received a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| functional behavior assessment that stated my son was not going to get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| behavior plan because his actions were attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| seeking. After parent liaison called West Haven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| Elementary, they emailed me a behavior draft a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| hours before our meeting. When I asked what changed, she told me it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| was a typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| I have one minute left. I'm going to leave that if anyone has any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1541)|
| 0:25:58| Thank you, Ms. Holland. Stacey Reese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| If you'll state your name, county of residence, and then you'll have three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| minutes. Thank you. I'm Dr. Stacey Reese. I live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1566)|

| 0:26:16| I was quite shocked during last month's public forum when I heard a member of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| Moms for Liberty claim to have spoken with a quote very supportive board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| member, as this group has been labeled an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| extremist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center and has consistently vilified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| and maligned educators and public education nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| I would ask if they have children in public schools because I'm perplexed as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| to why people whose children haven't been in public schools want to influence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| policy and have oversight of them. Complaints based on passages read out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| of context ignore the literary value of a book as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| and only support the importance of reading more and not less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| On Common Sense Media, one parent reviewed The Perks of Being a Wallflower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| the book in question from last month. As quote, one of the best books I've ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| read. It taught me a lot of important things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| about life and has a lot of beautiful quotes. My favorite is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| we accept the love that we deserve. Another parent wrote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| this book identifies with teenagers because it is relevant to what kids face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| today. It does not compromise the reader's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| judgment. Instead, it instills a sense of self| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| based on choice. Flagging books with mature content to avoid controversy may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| be well-intentioned. However, red flags don't provide any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| meaningful information about a book's literary or educational value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| Rather than evaluating the work as a whole, a red flag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| reduces complex literary works to a few isolated and quote, objectionable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| elements. In 1982, the United States Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| in the Island Trees School District versus Pico case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| decided that local school boards may not remove books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| from school library shelves simply because they dislike the ideas contained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| in those books. Teachers and librarians are college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| educated professionals who are trained to select materials for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| their educational value. The people I work with are compassionate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| knowledgeable, professional, and ethical. You wouldn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| hired us if we weren't. I'm also the parent of a little boy who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| will attend Knox County Schools and I believe that I absolutely have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| liberty to weigh in on things pertaining to my own child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| That's where my influence ends. I would never have the audacity to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| to influence others to make unilateral decisions for all children based on my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| beliefs and value system. The majority of our community does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1709)|

| 0:28:36| and no one group has any right to impose their views| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| on others or demand that an educational program reflect their personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| preferences. Content-based objections that lead to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-231207?start=1723)|
