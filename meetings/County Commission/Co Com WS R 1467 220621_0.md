| 0:02:50| number 55, number 56 through 59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=170)|
| 0:03:00| I'd like to ask for a motion to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| Motion to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| Motion by Commissioner Smith. Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=186)|
| 0:03:07| Second by Commissioner Boesler. All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| And the agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| Sorry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Clerk Nisbet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| Okay, these are honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| Item number 2 is R-22-6-102 is honoring Commissioner Carson Daly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=206)|
| 0:03:33| for winning the Keep Knoxville Beautiful Delicious Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=213)|
| 0:03:40| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| I know it's highly unusual to honor a sitting commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| but this is something that's been a passion of Carson's probably before he even came on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| It's an individual award that he's won, not as a commissioner, but as an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| So if anybody else wants to sign on, I'd be happy to have them sign on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| but I make a motion to move forward to the regular meeting without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| I'll sign on as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| I will too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| At this time, I'd like to move full commission to sign off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=251)|
| 0:04:20| Have a proper first and a proper second to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| Presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| This is presentation of rural metro monthly report by Jeff Bagwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=272)|
| 0:04:44| Mr. Chairman, commissioners, thanks for allowing me to speak early this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| I'll be out of town next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=289)|

| 0:04:52| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| Rural Metro Fire 160 North Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| Knoxville, if you didn't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| Our monthly report for May, 822 medical first responder calls, 82 car crashes, 28 residential structure fires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=298)|
| 0:05:08| 87 false alarms, 22 hazardous conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| There, it's up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| I could read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| Assignments are lift assist and 233 car fires, brush fires, or rubbish fires for a total of 1,485 for the total of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=316)|
| 0:05:27| We responded to properties valued at just over 1.59 million for the month of May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| and had a property loss of just shy of $40,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| which means we saved an average of 97% of the valued property with an average response time of four minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=336)|
| 0:05:43| and 50% of the reported fires were contained to the room of origin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| These numbers are more like what we're used to seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| Station 30 in Halls, Commissioner Schoonmaker, had an unusually off month last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| and they are now in second place responding to 151 emergencies, but Farragut Station 41 responded to 179.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=357)|
| 0:06:06| So they take first place, which is unusual in our world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| The North Battalion, however, remained the busiest at 471 emergencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| and the busiest hours were between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| Through our partnership with Knox County, we added three new educational videos to the YouTube library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| We had 279,409 views for the month, representing 15,000 hours of program time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=383)|
| 0:06:30| and logging just over 3.1 million impressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| We also added 493 new subscribers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| In addition, we had 31 in-person events that had approximately 1,800 contacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| So total contacts via all conduits was approximately 281,249.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=403)|
| 0:06:50| May was a good month for us in terms of recognizing our people for their life-saving efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| Several of our team, as you know, were recognized in Nashville at this year's Star of Life Awards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| as well as several were recognized here locally as well, including at this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| I can't tell you how rewarding it is to meet the people you've had a chance to change the course of their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=425)|
| 0:07:11| We recognize, however, that this is a team effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| All pre-hospital workers, dispatchers, firefighters, police, EMS personnel, everybody has a part in saving that person's life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=434)|
| 0:07:24| and it is never just the actions of one individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| We're just grateful to be part of that team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| As I discussed last month, summer is upon us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| We have seen an unusually high number of water rescues in the last month since we met last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=453)|
| 0:07:40| Boaters like to put in on the French Broad River, and they float down unknowing that TVA is discharging a lot of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=460)|
| 0:07:48| Next thing you know, their kayaks have capsized, and now they call us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| So we've had a huge number of those calls in the last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| Boater safety is critical this time of year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| It doesn't matter whether you're on the lake or on the river, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| We just want our people to understand their surroundings and be very familiar with where they're boating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=483)|
| 0:08:12| Our new baby has arrived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| Okay, the fire truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| The ladder truck is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| We'll be having a dedication of that truck on June the 30th, 10 a.m. at Station 36 in Powell, and we hope you can attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=499)|
| 0:08:29| We'll get you all emails about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| Again, just so you know, this is the most expensive fire truck ever purchased by Rural Metro Fire here in Knox County, for use in Knox County, at $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=511)|
| 0:08:43| That's a huge, significant investment by our company for fire protection here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| Likely, when we replace the aerial tower truck that's in West Knoxville, the cost will be closer to $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=529)|

| 0:09:08| Mr. Bagwell, you mentioned the baby came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| What weight did that baby come in at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| We really don't like talking about her weight, but 38.5 tons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| 41.4 and three-quarter inches long, feet long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| She's a big girl, and there's some pictures of us doing the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| The training's complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| When we do the dedication, we promise to keep Commissioner Daley away from the air horns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| I was going to ask if he's checked out the horn yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| Yeah, we might do that when you all are long gone, you know, away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| You're lucky in my world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| You're lucky, but my wife's got a big horn, so I'll have to be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| In the Fire and Rescue Committee, we had talked about the kayaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| I think the biggest problem or the biggest issue might be from a vendor renting those out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| and sending people down the river if they don't know what they're really doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| They had discussed about getting with that vendor and saying, hey, listen, this is—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| That got put in my lap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=612)|

| 0:10:18| So, yeah, and, you know, there's a lot of things we're trying to do to get people to pay attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| TVA has on their website, they tell people when they're discharging water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| We just want people to go to that and look at it before they put their boat in the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| Kind of be a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| We don't have that problem on Beaver Creek, though, do we, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=635)|

| 0:11:00| Now we're going to move on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| I have a Karen Bussell to speak about proposed road closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=664)|
| 0:11:12| Good approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=672)|
| 0:11:19| How are you this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| Hello, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| My name is Karen Bussell, resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| Because I can't hear myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| We are here to oppose the permanent closure of Old Tassel Pike from Luttrell Road to Murphy Road in northeast Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=695)|
| 0:11:50| The problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| Since 2000, population growth in our greater community has increased by 21.46%, according to USA.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=713)|
| 0:12:07| Tassel Pike is a major road in our community and carries a lot of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=727)|
| 0:12:14| Due to this rapid growth and development, it has become increasingly more difficult to exit our Ridge View community onto busy Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=734)|
| 0:12:27| In order to exit our Ridge View community heading west toward town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| we are often faced with a 1.5 to 3-minute wait before we can get an opening to make the left-hand turn onto Tassel Pike, depending on the time of day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=753)|
| 0:12:47| From 2019 to the present day, there have been 20 vehicle crashes, according to Knox County Traffic Engineering, a block down from the street from Ridge View and Tassel Pike intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=767)|
| 0:13:05| Does that surprise anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| It surprised me when I found out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| This is a dangerous situation, and oftentimes it seems like we're taking our lives into our own hands, trying to make a left-hand turn to merge onto Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=789)|
| 0:13:22| How have we coped?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| For the past several years, many of us have found that when heading toward town, taking old Tassel Pike through to Murphy Road and avoiding Tassel Pike altogether is a much safer route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=805)|
| 0:13:42| This is our go-to safety net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| Proposed Road Closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| Old Tassel Pike is a continuous street, for those who might not know, about a mile long and is bisected by Luttrell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=830)|
| 0:14:01| As part of a new subdivision being built at the corner of Old Tassel Pike and Murphy Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| it appears that Knox County Engineering Department has partnered with a new subdivision developer and consulted with the households on the lower end of Old Tassel Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=847)|
| 0:14:20| the portion that exits onto Murphy Road, to permanently close this portion of the road to through traffic while allowing these households to exit through the new subdivision exit onto Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=860)|
| 0:14:37| This would mean that through traffic to Murphy Road, both the Ridgeview neighborhood and the upper end of Old Tassel Pike will no longer be possible and will cause a great deal of disruption to the Ridgeview community, which I am representing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=877)|
| 0:14:54| If approved, this decision would dump even more traffic onto an already busy Tassel Pike and potentially more accidents would result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=894)|
| 0:15:07| It appears that the Knox County Engineering Department has worked out an agreement with those 10 households on the lower portion of Old Tassel Pike to propose this road closing to through traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=907)|
| 0:15:20| However, they completely ignored the 75 plus, and that is a conservative estimate, households in the Ridgeview community that would be negatively impacted by this proposed road closure, making our commute much less safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=920)|
| 0:15:45| With this proposed closure, it is interesting to note that the residents of this new subdivision will have an exit onto Murphy Road where we will not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=945)|
| 0:15:58| Possible solutions. Leave the entrance to Old Tassel Pike open through to Murphy Road so that the Ridgeview community could avoid trying to make that left-hand turn onto Old Tassel Pike when heading west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=958)|
| 0:16:16| Suggestion number two. Install a traffic light at the corner of Tassel Pike and Ridgeview Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=976)|
| 0:16:25| Suggestion number three. Install a traffic light at the intersection of Tassel Pike and Carter Road, the site of those 20 accidents that I mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=985)|
| 0:16:39| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| Thank you. Your consideration in this would be appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| Thank you, ma'am. I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| Next, we have Kevin Murphy wanting to speak about agenda item number nine as well as agenda item number 59. Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1014)|
| 0:17:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm going to actually correct myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| Same item, instead of item number nine, it's the Tassel Pike Road closure, which is not that item, and then 59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1031)|
| 0:17:19| First, on the Tassel Pike or Old Tassel Pike Road closure, certainly if there was a decision to actually close it, I would ask that pedestrian and bike access be maintained, bicycle access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1039)|
| 0:17:34| That road does get bicycle traffic on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| There's some rides that go out that way and go out Old Tassel Pike further and then out Ridgeview Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| And that continued access would at least allow that traffic to stay off of main Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1063)|
| 0:17:50| You'd be able to cut over to Murphy Road, and then eventually they'll be actually able to connect to an expanded Washington Pike, which has sidewalks and bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1070)|
| 0:17:57| So I think it's important if there is a consideration for a road closure not to preclude pedestrian and bicycle connectivity that exists today but would be completely cut off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1077)|
| 0:18:06| We would not want a pedestrian on Tassel Pike as it exists, and they would be forced to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| Second item that I wish to speak on is the resolution that's in front of you for the Board of Zoning Appeals and changing the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1092)|
| 0:18:23| I'm speaking – I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman, I forgot my address is 4508 Murphy Road. I need that formality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| I'm speaking as the chair of the Knox County Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| This is – so I appreciate that conversation that occurred at Planning Commission just a short two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1113)|
| 0:18:41| And I think this is the fastest I've ever seen something come from Planning Commission to County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| It came in with a lot of speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| We – so the Planning Alliance, there's – we understand a little bit more, and it was helpful to see Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| on the desire for development plans associated with just a standard subdivision under planned residential to not be appealable to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1135)|
| 0:19:06| They did make their recommendation that uses on review should still be appealed in all zones, but their resolution that they passed was specific about planned residential development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1146)|
| 0:19:19| I think the resolution, though, is the law director's department has given it to you, does – it actually says that all zones, the development plans would be appealable directly to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1159)|
| 0:19:30| It doesn't just limit that to planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| So that's – I wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| That's a difference in how the Planning Commission made a recommendation than how the resolution is written that's in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1175)|
| 0:19:43| But regardless of that, I think the desire is we all want to look at a good – what's the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| What are some good outcomes we can look – how can we – and how can we create good outcomes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| And I think from our standpoint in the Planning Alliance, the problem that we have is that development plans for any zone are – they're pretty big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1194)|
| 0:20:06| They're complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| I think most development plans are going to have an engineer associated with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| And today there's only – it's a very short timeframe that the community and the applicant have to work and deal with those development plans, just six days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1211)|
| 0:20:19| from when the development plan is published as part of the staff report to when it is heard at Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| That's six days that you have to read the engineering study, understand the background, go out and look at the site yourself as a neighbor and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1225)|
| 0:20:35| And that's a really short time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| One of the things that allowing a development plan to go to the Board of Zoning Appeals does is it gives you that chance to, all right, if we didn't get it in that six days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1238)|
| 0:20:48| if Planning Commission took staff recommendation, passed it and all that, that does give the neighborhood the opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| or even the developer if they feel like they didn't get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| It gives you the opportunity to go get that traffic engineer study or go find that geologist or something, that professional evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1258)|
| 0:21:06| which is the standard of evidence that sometimes your court would require to review testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| It gives you that time, and that's something that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| And so by having an appeal of a development plan go to Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| it does give you that time where they can hear it to no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| That gives you extra time, and that's important, and that's one of the biggest drawbacks to the resolution that's on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1284)|
| 0:21:33| It kind of pains me as a former chair of the Board of Zoning Appeals that I've seen where they haven't had a quorum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| or they've been just at five votes or five people, and you need five affirmative votes to pass something at BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1299)|
| 0:21:46| That's something I hope that the commission and the board will take up and try and figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1306)|
| 0:21:53| It's a thankless job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| There's no pay, a lot of time put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| You all know that from your zoning matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| Same thing with the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| But I think it's also important that BZA, if there's some challenges with them getting enough people there and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| to fix that because that problem doesn't impact just appeals of uses on review and development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| It impacts anybody that goes to BZA for just a standard variance, and that's a really important one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| So we're really looking at the planning lines, how can we get some good outcomes from this and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| We'll probably speak more next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| That is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| Next we will move on to a motion for the approval of the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1358)|
| 0:22:45| I have a motion by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| That is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| Now we'll move on to Drives and Roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| Clerk Nisbet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1379)|
| 0:23:06| A consideration of the acceptance of New County Roads will be heard Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1386)|
| 0:23:13| I'd like to send those forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| And then we will move on to a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| I have a motion by Commissioner Daly and a second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| Consideration of the closure of a portion of Old Taspel Pike near the First Comforter Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| to improve safety for motorists and adjacent residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| Move to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| I have a motion by Commissioner Jay and a second by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| I'd like Mr. Caldwell, excuse me, Mr. Snowden to come down for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1440)|
| 0:24:14| Yes, sir, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| I'm a speaker for Public Forum, and I was trying to follow on Google Maps from a satellite view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| and they kept mentioning other roads that connect to Old Taspel Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| unless I was misunderstanding what the speaker was intending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| But in your paperwork that you submitted, you're just going to close the western portion and eastern portion, correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1474)|
| 0:24:42| and leave the center part still the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| And then move the, which would be better for traffic access, the new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| then the entrance would be further down Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| Yes, sir, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| The development that has been proposed now currently under construction out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| they are going to move the intersection of Old Taspel Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1503)|
| 0:25:10| I guess that would be to the south, away from Taspel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| The intersection separation there is problematic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| so instead of allowing them to come in at that existing alignment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| we're making them shift their entrance as far as they can towards Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| to provide for better separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| And then the intersection of Old Taspel Pike and Luttrell Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1532)|
| 0:25:39| I don't know if you should be looking at there, it's very unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| One of the most challenging intersections we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| You essentially have three intersections all in one very small area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| which as things have developed over time out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| and these folks bring up some very good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| I certainly understand their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| There are some tradeoffs with that, and we knew there would be that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| But we feel like the introduction of more traffic as these properties develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| using that very problematic intersection of Old Taspel Pike and Luttrell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| is more of a pressing concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| So we would be, the developer would be modifying the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| and the intersection at Murphy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| and then the county would be responsible for installing a cul-de-sac,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| some sort of minor, small turnaround near the church that you see there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1591)|
| 0:26:38| to where you couldn't be able to access it going north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| So there are no other streets that connect with Old Taspel Pike then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| Not in this block range, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| Jim, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| Yes, sir, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| When you started this process, just from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| was this a request from a citizen or a worker or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| It was proactively by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| When the development came in at the corner there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| we realized that this was an opportunity for us to potentially fix some of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1637)|
| 0:27:26| I can't remember the exact number of homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| that are going to be constructed in that new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| but there's that development as well as some townhouses being proposed in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| And as some of those properties do develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| we just wanted to reduce the traffic at that northern intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| because of its unusual alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| I will make a trip out there this week sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| It looks like Old Taspel Pike crosses at Murphy, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| That's Luttrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| It actually terminates at Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| The right-of-way extends down, but that portion was never constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| We're talking about close to one at Luttrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| Very close to Luttrell because that end up there at Luttrell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| that house that's right there on the corner is about 12 or 13 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| so it's the width of a driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| That's my next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| We decided to go, so I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| I'm going to make a trip out there just to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| Thanks for the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| Sure. We appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| Mr. Snowden, would you mind providing the Commission sometime before next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| some sort of visual of the overlay of the existing versus the proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1723)|
| 0:28:50| Less has been provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| I've seen the development plans and some of the other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| but I'd love to just have your team give us a map of here's what it looks like today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| here's our improvements, here's what it looks like next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| If we do this and why and how,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| and obviously you've heard the concerns that were addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| If you could just talk to us about those this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| I'll get our GIS folks to put together a map showing all that as a summary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| and email it to you guys tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| Is there also, thank you for doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| are there any plans for a light at what looks like one of the worst intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| ever designed of all time in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| because there's like 19 roads that come into the exact same spot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| This looks like a roundabout place or a light or something that could help long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| Yeah, I would envision, you know, if the state were to ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| and this is me speaking as an engineer, not necessarily representing the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| but if the state were to widen Tazewell Pike through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| they would probably redo that entire intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| and probably potentially even close it there anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| Luttrell Road is a minor road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| It's a minor collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| Obviously the signal at Ridgeview is something we can examine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1800)|
| 0:30:07| I mean, that's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| As well as, you know, we talked to the state about Carter Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| you know, just down from that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| It's somewhat problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| But if the state were to widen Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| certainly that intersection would be redone, closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| It would be a significant change to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| Commissioner Jay asked one of my questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| about if there were any plans with the development going on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| for any signalization to relieve some of this pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| Also, has there been any consideration to the points Mr. Murphy made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| about pedestrian and bicycle right-of-way staying intact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| Yeah, we can look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| One of the things that we haven't spoke to the individual landowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| there's one individual that owns on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| He may or may not be as supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| So I'd like kind of, you know, from direction from this body to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| One of my concerns with that is the width of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| is essentially the width of a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| So if we were to leave it open to provide for that pedestrian activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| the road would essentially be left open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| in the sense that it would look very much like it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| and potentially people might use it, you know, unlawfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| So there would have to be some consideration made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| to somehow allow the pedestrian and the bicycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| but yet not allow the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| So that is one thing we'd have to work through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1905)|
| 0:31:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| I have a proper first and a proper second to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| No recommendation on item number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Those opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| And the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| Now we'll move on to line-item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| Line-item transfers, total amount of $2,646,548.03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1930)|
| 0:32:17| Motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| And I have a follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| I have a follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| Mr. Snowden again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1947)|
| 0:32:35| In your page three of your budget transfer request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| you have a capital outlay other equipment for $52,525| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1958)|
| 0:32:45| that was in your budget this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| What was that equipment that you were planning to buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| and are you now going to put it in your budget for next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| to buy that equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| If memory serves me correctly, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| that was a roadside mower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| There's been, as with a lot of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| we are having a real hard time getting parts for equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| because we buy the tractor separately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| and then we have to buy all the attachments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| So you're really buying two separate things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| and then having to put them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| And the last one we bought took over a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| to get assembled together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| So if I'm not mistaken, that's what that transfer is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| So you're still going to go move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| with buying the equipment necessary for your department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| Because as you see, grass is growing very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| so we definitely need that mower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| I have a proper first and a proper second to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| We'll move forward with budget amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| Budget amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Total credit amount of $10,492.36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| Motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| And I also have a follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| Commissioner Schoenberger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2052)|
| 0:34:19| On your adopted budget and revisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| I've never really seen this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| but what is classified as liquidated finance contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| paid unencumbered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| It's when a contract has been encumbered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| and we liquidate it so it shows as a negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| Even though there was a balance or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2083)|

| 0:35:28| I have a proper first by Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| a second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2130)|

| 0:41:31| And from my perspective, I see the unique challenges that my clients have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| not only from the development standpoint but taking it all the way through the construction portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| In fact, one of the things that I enjoy as much as anything is going into my contractor clients' offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| and seeing the end result, many of which projects this commission and others have approved over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2507)|
| 0:41:56| and admiring the growth and the end result of what they've accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2516)|

| 0:42:16| and asked me if I would be interested in serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| Certainly, if it's something that this board or this commission would like me to do, I'd be pleased to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2542)|

| 0:42:35| It's not a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| I just wanted to ask if the chairman and my fellow commissioners thought it would be appropriate since they came tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2556)|
| 0:42:42| that we not ask them to come back at next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2562)|
| 0:42:51| I think that's appropriate myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| I think so as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2575)|

| 0:42:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| You being a lawyer, it looks like contract law, contractors do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| How would you view the asset?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| How do you see that being an asset?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| Well, I've prepared contracts from a developer standpoint, from an owner standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| and from a construction or contractor standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| I see a lot of the challenges that you have when you're dealing with projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| In fact, I worked on a project this afternoon for a State Bridge Suites project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2606)|
| 0:43:32| and so you see some of the difficulties that you have from getting the project off the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| through the whole process to ultimately when you open the doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| And so you're trying to solve those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| In fact, that's what I do is try to solve problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| I think from my perspective, and it may not be any more than what some of the other candidates have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| but from my perspective, because I've been doing that for 33 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| I see or can anticipate some of the difficulties that some of these projects may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| and maybe offer observations or suggestions to help avoid those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| When you get to the point that you're transitioning from, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| the party that's wanting to develop a project here in the county through different zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2654)|
| 0:44:20| and other aspects of it and then the construction aspects of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| you heard a perfect example of some of the challenges we all have is the infrastructure that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| the roads that you deal with, and the discussions you had earlier with Old Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| And maybe my involvement would allow me to comment and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2675)|

| 0:44:54| or someone else may not have anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2694)|

| 0:45:08| and show back up next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2708)|

| 0:45:14| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2714)|

| 0:45:23| Can we approve them after here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| Or unless they want to have another exciting afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| I think you can just approve them all tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| I said unless they want to come back and spend another exciting afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| waiting for their names to be called again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2736)|

| 0:45:54| Mr. Bobham, Ms. Rotman, Mr. Moran, and Mr. Little, and just move it to the consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2754)|

| 0:46:13| Don't we have to nominate since we have six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| Wouldn't we have to nominate and do a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| Yeah, you do your normal procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| We only have five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2786)|

| 0:46:43| It makes sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| Does anyone have that in the form of a substitute motion, or did you just amend the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2805)|
| 0:46:53| Whatever the pleasure of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2813)|

| 0:47:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2832)|

| 0:47:42| Just want to make sure that we're doing it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2862)|

| 0:48:27| term to fulfill the rest of a term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=2907)|

| 0:50:59| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| This is not one, when we assumed the operations of the IDB, this was not something we went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| over, and I did not do a good job, so next time we do this, I promise it will be much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3068)|

| 0:51:11| for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3071)|

| 0:52:07| I did, and I just had a comment after reading the resolution noting that it specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3127)|
| 0:52:13| identifies the Andrew Johnson project, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| I'm fine with that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3139)|

| 0:52:49| Hey, Commissioner Daley, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| I was giving Odom a hard time for blaming me for the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| We'll put you under the spotlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| I spoke with Chris this morning and asked him a question about where it says, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| an office, okay, it says accept or waive payments in lieu of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| This in no way delegates their authority to take away from county commissions the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| to collect any type of fees, the $60,000 fee or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| Do you understand what I'm asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| Yes, I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| So you have a general delegation resolution to the IDB for most industrial projects that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3187)|
| 0:53:36| covers everything, and so when those, say, a manufacturer comes to an industrial park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| you don't even see those anymore because this is outside those policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3222)|
| 0:53:48| This is coming to you for a special delegation resolution where we've actually built in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| as you just stated, the actual payments and the actual terms, so you actually have more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| constraints on this one than you would if it was one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| So all the IDB really can do is negotiate a pilot lease consistent with what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| approving tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| They can't go outside the boundaries of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| And so, in other words, they couldn't say, oh, we're only going to do $50,000 or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| They have to do that, and that has to go to the pilot payments will be made, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| like taxes would normally be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| And they will not be able to forgive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| They can't forgive the pilot payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| They will not be allowed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| And I will make sure that's in the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| Mr. Schoomaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| Mr. Mamentoff, this has been a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| It started with four sitting commissioners and another mayoral administration when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3281)|
| 0:54:49| developer said he was going to buy the building outright, $6 million, no tax incentives, anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3289)|
| 0:54:56| like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| And then that morphed in April of 2021 to an agreement that our third-party independent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3297)|
| 0:55:08| analysis was done for the financing, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| And they came back and said that they approved 12 years payment in lieu of taxes of $110,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3312)|
| 0:55:22| Now, a year and two months later, we're back again with the third now option for the Andrew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3322)|

| 0:55:40| payment from $110,000 to $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| Is that still correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| Everything you said is correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| So was there an independent third-party analysis of this new proposition to go from 12 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3347)|
| 0:55:56| to 17 years, which is supposed to hold the commissioners harmless because we're getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3356)|
| 0:56:02| a third-party independent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| Was that actually done by that same, what is it, Municap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| No, it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| We could, because the fact, the terms had changed, he eliminated the apartment component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| of the project, it was now all hotel, we'd have to essentially redo, we'd have to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3380)|
| 0:56:28| Municap another $10,000 essentially to redo the report, it would probably take a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| months to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| And we talked about it and Chris Caldwell and I looked at the Municap report, looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3393)|
| 0:56:40| at the numerical projections of the report, tried to derive from that what the likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3400)|
| 0:56:47| term of a pilot would be based on that methodology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| Can we probably, based on his construction estimates, even be longer than 17 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| If it is the will of this body, we could go back and ask for another third-party report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| from Municap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| I'm confident it would come out at least based to that 17 years, assuming a hotel use, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3423)|
| 0:57:10| I can't guarantee it, Commissioner Schoonmaker, and it's an excellent question, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| why we did not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| Okay, but you can understand from our standpoint, by having the third-party takes the way, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3436)|
| 0:57:22| know, that we're just making decisions without any backup to them, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3442)|
| 0:57:28| I would say it's very much a compromise, you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| He asked for 25 years and $50,000, and so this was a compromise based on negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3451)|
| 0:57:40| with the developer, but your point is very, is fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| And then in comparing the April 2021 resolution to the one that was presented to us today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3465)|
| 0:57:56| is the entire resolution that was adopted in April 2021 being deleted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3476)|
| 0:58:05| Because there's a caption in here that says, whereas the developer has requested the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3485)|
| 0:58:12| which would be the Industrial Development Board, to hold ownership of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3492)|
| 0:58:19| Is that now going away under the new contract, or is that just not listed in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| It's not listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| This was an amendment of the prior delegation resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| The IDB would still have to take title for the pilot to take effect, so the ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3508)|
| 0:58:34| what you just read to me, is still accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| So, on, we were supposed to close on June 30th this year, and now the developers requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3517)|
| 0:58:45| to July 30th this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| On July 30th of this year, will we receive, will Knox County receive a check for $6 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3527)|
| 0:58:53| Probably a wire transfer, but yes, you will receive that amount of money, unless he walks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| on us, in which case we will keep his $100,000 earnest money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| We'd have to actually hit a letter of credit, but that's what would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| I'm not suggesting he's going to walk on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| I'm just, I mean, I really strongly encouraged him to come next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| He was quarantined tonight due to COVID, which is why he said he couldn't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| Well, and, you know, I've been very supportive of our other pilots and TIFs, but I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3559)|
| 0:59:26| because I was one of the original four that was promised nothing, that this was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3566)|
| 0:59:32| to go immediately on the tax rolls, and we'd get $6 million cash, and that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3572)|
| 0:59:39| And then now it's been changed and changed and changed, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| I think your points are excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| The only thing I, and I'm, I think this is obviously a key, you know, decision for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| I do, the one aspect of this that excites me some, and he confirmed that in an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| to me earlier today, is that it will be all hotels, so we will get the sales tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3597)|
| 1:00:04| and the related hotel-motel tax instead of going to the five-year apartments as before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3604)|
| 1:00:10| We will not receive any sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| We will only receive hotel-motel tax because that property is inside the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3612)|
| 1:00:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| And I know I use that thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| I mean, the schools will receive roughly 72% of the sales tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| I always treat the schools as sort of part of the county, but yes, you're, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| It does not go to the county general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| The floor is open for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| I have a proper first by Commissioner Jayes, second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| We're going to do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3651)|
| 1:00:57| One nay, one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| So, Commissioner Ward is a pass, Commissioner Spoonmaker is a nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3658)|
| 1:01:12| So, the vote's 9-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3674)|
| 1:01:20| Oh, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| 8-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| 8-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| Is that still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3685)|
| 1:01:44| I couldn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| I'm sorry, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| It didn't pass unanimously, so it will be on next week's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| So, this is without recommendation right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| Item number 48's been moved forward with no recommendation for the vote count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| Wait, wait, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| My motion was to approve it, which would send it on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| Do I have to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| Somebody use your microphone over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| So, use your microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| The paperwork involves a TIF, so it should be voted on at a full commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| not at a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| That's a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| We do it as a, you know, moving forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| It doesn't have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| It's a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| Personally, I think it would be prudent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| It didn't pass unanimously anyway, so it automatically goes to the next agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3755)|
| 1:02:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| Commissioner Smith is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| Director Boots said, could you say that into your mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| Sorry, I couldn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| I said, Commissioner was correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| If it's not unanimous, it automatically goes forward to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| If it's unanimous, then it could have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| So, now does the vote, does the motion go to, do I need another motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3790)|
| 1:03:16| Do I need another motion to move forward with no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| I'll change my motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| Is Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3807)|

| 1:03:40| Item number 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| This is resolution 902, consideration of a resolution to levy the mineral severance tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3822)|
| 1:03:55| for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| Motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| We have a proper first and a proper second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| Commissioner Hill, you pulled this one off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| I just wanted Commissioner Schoonmaker just to expand a little bit on what your thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3848)|
| 1:04:14| are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| That's why my light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3859)|
| 1:04:20| Duly recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| Yes, this is a great opportunity for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| The state of Tennessee, in their infinite wisdom several years ago, allowed counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3869)|
| 1:04:35| to charge a mineral severance fee of 15 cents per ton on things like sandstone, gravel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3875)|
| 1:04:45| chert, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| And the reason was is because those type vehicles are usually carrying 20 to 25 tons of material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3887)|
| 1:04:55| which then in turn tears up the county roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| So 68 of the 95 counties in Tennessee currently are charging the mineral severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3899)|
| 1:05:06| Of course, the state uses the term tax, but it's a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| The good part is the state general assembly did mandate that if you are collecting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3912)|
| 1:05:19| fee, that it goes directly to the highway fund, where Mr. Snowden and his staff in preliminary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3919)|
| 1:05:27| discussions, we've talked about that going exclusively to residential repaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3927)|
| 1:05:33| Preliminary estimates on the revenue side of this could be at least $750,000, upwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3933)|
| 1:05:44| of $900,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| The other thing is, and of course some of the counties in Tennessee do not collect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3948)|
| 1:05:58| tax because they don't have a gravel pit or a mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| But 68 out of the 95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| And in your paperwork that you receive, you can actually see the chart of all the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3965)|
| 1:06:11| counties that do collect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| So we're kind of like the little donut in East Tennessee of the ones that are not collecting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3974)|
| 1:06:23| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| Commissioner Koemaker, dirt is not considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3987)|
| 1:06:33| The way that it's sand, gravel, sandstone, chert, and limestone severed from the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=3993)|
| 1:06:42| within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| The reason I ask that question is I've got an out-of-county contractor that has torn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4005)|
| 1:06:51| up one of my roads major, and all they're doing is hauling dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| It's destroying that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| I was hoping that maybe that would be a part of it, but it doesn't sound like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| It was mainly the bulk heavy material, the gravel and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4023)|
| 1:07:09| The chert, which is part granite, you can imagine what the weight is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4029)|
| 1:07:15| And particularly in the Chairman's District, this would be very applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4035)|
| 1:07:23| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| Or Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| Commissioner Skinmaker said that it might all go towards residential paving, but would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4053)|
| 1:07:39| you also be prioritizing the areas around the various mines and pits that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4059)|
| 1:07:45| Because it seems to me that those mostly on state routes that we're not going to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| to repay or repair right outside of the quarries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| It seems like that ought to be the priority first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| We use, and certainly look for direction from you guys and gals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| but we use pavement management systems that I think we've talked about several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| that we look at the roads in what's called an OCI, or an overall condition index,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| that looks at all the different deficiencies of the roadway and assigns it a numerical score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| And then we, depending on the numerical score, we select a certain type of treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| We typically do it from bottom up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| Oftentimes the quarries are usually around roadways that are probably built more appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4109)|
| 1:08:37| for that type of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| Everett Road, Mascot Road, John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4119)|
| 1:08:45| We typically don't see a tremendous amount of surface degradation on those roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4125)|
| 1:08:52| We would use this, Commissioner Schoonmaker's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| in areas that was identified per the pavement management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4135)|
| 1:09:03| Okay, so it doesn't necessarily fix the roads right around the quarries and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| It fixes all the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| It does because all the roads that we have, there's development and building going on all those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4150)|
| 1:09:19| whether it be collectors, arterials, or local streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| and all those concrete trucks, gravel trucks do have to get to those building sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| So we would, if this were to pass, we would use this and prioritize this extra funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4167)|
| 1:09:34| through the pavement management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| And how much would you fund, roughly, for pavement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| This budget year that we're going into, starting July 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| we have $6 million allocated for road paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| And how many miles would that be, roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| I did that math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| I know our costs have gone up, what, 30%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| And that's another good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| Also on this agenda tonight is a contract, an annual resurfacing contract with Rogers Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4198)|
| 1:10:04| And the price of asphalt, much like the price of a lot of petroleum products| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4204)|
| 1:10:10| from last year's fiscal year budget, we were paying $86.50 a ton for in-place asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4210)|
| 1:10:18| This year we're paying $116.50, so it went up 35%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4218)|
| 1:10:23| So this additional revenue stream, from a selfish perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| would be nice to supplement some of that loss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| because last year we were paving a road for about $100,000 a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4230)|
| 1:10:37| Now it's going to cost us $136,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| And how many miles will you do this year, roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| With $6 million, approximately 44 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| 44, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| If this were to pass, I did some rough math based on Commissioner Schoonmaker's projections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4250)|
| 1:10:56| it would add about 6 to 7 miles back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| So it would get us closer to our target that we did this year, which was close to 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4260)|
| 1:11:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| I'm going to have to quit letting Commissioner Jay go before me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| because he steals my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| With paving costs up 35%, and with, I think we've lost a million dollars from the state also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4278)|
| 1:11:27| is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| What was that, Commissioner Smith? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| We've lost a million dollars from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| that would also go towards engineering and public works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| It makes me consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| But I want to make sure we've considered everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| You know, you mentioned Everett, Mascot, John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4305)|
| 1:11:50| These are, and John, the surrounding counties all have this tax in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| Blount, Anderson, Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| I'm just wondering if analysis has been done to see if this might divert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4322)|
| 1:12:11| the other counties that may be buying from our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| because we don't have this tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| Has there been any look into that to see if it might have an adverse effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| on these businesses with the surrounding counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| When this was originally proposed by Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| I reached out to the two large quarries in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| Blue Water and Vulcan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| Vulcan didn't get back with me, but I did meet with Blue Water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| and they did not express that concern specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| If you want to go ahead, Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| and read the outline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| To follow up to Commissioner Smith's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| Cocke, Green, Unicoi, Hawkins, Granger, Claiborne, Union, Campbell, Anderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4375)|
| 1:13:02| Rhone, Cumberland, Ray, Miggs, McMinn, Monroe, Blount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| Bledsoe, Cumberland County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4387)|
| 1:13:13| Leiden County too, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| And just one other thing I forgot to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| The way the five mines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| quarries that are here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| don't pay us directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| It goes directly to the Department of Revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| They pay it quarterly, and then once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| the Department of Revenue receives it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| that money comes directly back and earmarked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| to the Engineering and Public Works Department from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| Do they charge any fee for that service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| I don't know that for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| but we're getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| Mr. Snowden, a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| You were talking about the load-bearing roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| that we have in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| Okay, some of them are designed to carry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| like 10 tons, 5 tons, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| And some of those areas, they have large trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| go through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| Is there any way that we could put maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| some signs up when they start to get on those roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| that say no more than X number of pounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| or just give them the load limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| and then if they exceed that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| they start tearing up the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| Is there any way that we could get any of that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| back from those companies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| We're a little bit in a unique spot there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| because by state law, it's my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| if the vehicle is legally weighted to be on the roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| they can, so it's kind of up to us to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| that that roadway is standard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| What we can do, though, is if a bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| is identified as something that is load-restricted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| which thankfully, very few of ours are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| maybe one or two, we do post those signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| at the direction of the state and can enforce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| But oftentimes, it's really up to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| to make sure that that road is able to carry that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| 20 tons is, I think, is what the requirement is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| for a legal loaded tandem axle dump truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| So that's kind of, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| we're a little bit limited in our authority with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| The only reason why I was asking that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| there was some major dirt done out in my area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| some years ago, but the agreement was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| that whatever roads that they tore up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| they would repair or pay for it to have it repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| And I didn't know if there's some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| that we could keep up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| If you get a permit through your office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| and you want to move an extra thousand square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| of dirt, that we can get onto that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4550)|
| 1:15:54| to help protect our roads also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| And oftentimes, we've got a situation like that now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| where we're actually working with the contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| and going to partner with them to fix the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| but technically, they don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| But we have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| You can get commercial vehicle enforcement involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| and actually check the weights of the trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| and if they are exceeding that maximum legal limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| then we can enforce those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| But as long as they're within the threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| of that 20-ton limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| we're kind of a little bit limited in our authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| Any follow-up questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4591)|
| 1:16:32| All right, we have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| to send forward that recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| with a proper first and a proper second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4596)|

| 1:16:44| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| Moving on to number 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4607)|
| 1:16:53| This is resolution R-22-6-908.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| It's a resolution approving amendment 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4618)|

| 1:17:13| the state under the grant contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| of $183,392| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| and extends the term by one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| to expire June 30, 2023| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| and no local match required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4644)|
| 1:17:32| This was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| I have a motion by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4654)|

| 1:17:43| This is to move forward with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| or is this a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4665)|

| 1:20:52| Commissioner Bussler. Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| It looks like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| we have another item coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| right after this, number 58,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| that includes a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| more than what I've put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| in mind. It looks like it's the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| thing, but there's some other additions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| added to it. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4869)|
| 1:21:13| So reviewing item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| 59, that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| also on first reading, there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| a lot. I haven't yet to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| with Chairman Beeler about this, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| it looks like 58 does have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| a lot of the same things that 57 does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| The reason why I'm saying this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| we're going to beat two horses to death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| at one time, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| if this one that I presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| was to take care of a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| right then because we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| no Merritt Council legally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| operating, and that's why I put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| that one out there, but this other one has some items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| in it, so if it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| pleases the commission here, I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| withdraw my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4915)|

| 1:22:05| recommendation. It's not a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| I have a proper first and a proper second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4929)|

| 1:22:17| there is one glaring difference, and that is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| 57, the item that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| before us now, says in the caption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| to bring us in compliance with state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4943)|

| 1:22:33| Motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| is to move forward with no recommendation. It has a proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| first and a proper second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=4957)|

| 1:24:50| I just have a quick statement before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| open up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| vitally important that our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| have protections. I've always stated that the merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| system is necessary and needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| but I believe it needs further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| reforms. I've spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| almost two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| with efforts to make the merit system a better functioning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| more transparent, fairer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| and more honest governing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| The goal in these proposed reforms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| before you remains true to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| the original formation of the merit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| back in 1971.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| The effort to remove politics from actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| of the sheriff that they might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| take and provide a system of protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| for our law enforcement professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| I want to thank the commissioners who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| supported efforts last year to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| reforms that established the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| and his team are responsible for recruiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| so that they can continue building the workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| of the future in an efficient manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| and that those who supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| mandating transparency guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| that ensured our officers, employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| and the public at large would have full access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| to merit system information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| and procedures. Now I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| it's time to enact more reforms to build a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| merit system that everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| can be proud of and find trust in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5158)|

| 1:26:12| I would like to remind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| my colleagues that the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| is the oversight entity for the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| This is our responsibility to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| govern. As we discussed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| proposed ordinance changes before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| I encourage you to review these on your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| review these on their own merits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| and ask yourselves if the reforms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| proposed will make the merit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| a better, fairer, and more accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| and more transparent protection system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| for our officers. Thank you for your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| Mr. Chairman. With your approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| we can handle it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| two ways. Open it up for discussion or I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| review and go through the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| reforms as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| top sheet says. Either way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| it's up to you. Let's move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| to the other commissioners and then come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| for you to speak the second time. Okay. I provided a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| top sheet narrative that sort of breaks down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| the series of proposals. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5218)|

| 1:27:05| wanted to voice my support. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| got to read this this morning. I called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| Drusilla midday and asked her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| to put me on there as a co-sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| This is, and I think everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| known this for the last two years, my biggest thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| with the merit council has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| to take the political part out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| And this is the first thing I've seen that actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| does that, takes the political part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| as much as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| out of it. The rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| of it I thought was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| The way it's structured, I like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| it better. I like seven versus three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| I like the way we house it in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| versus the other way that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| currently have, which is really not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| a lot of oversight at all. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| just wanted to voice my opinion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| just thank Commissioner Jay for doing the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5267)|

| 1:27:53| one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| I think in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| 74 Act it says the appointee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| is chief and a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| other positions. The language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| currently reads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| seven positions, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| In this it just says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| appointees. It doesn't put a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| on it or it doesn't put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| any kind of structure as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| what are appointed positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| Could you clarify your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| Maybe I can't hear it well enough over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5303)|

| 1:28:39| size of the board. That essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| outlines who is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| I know it doesn't have anything to do with the size of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| board, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| who will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| determine what are appointees and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| are classified? I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| turn that question over to Director Buch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| It's a legal term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| that helps determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| who is protected under the merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5339)|

| 1:29:03| a legal bit of language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| that was written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| The classified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5347)|

| 1:29:17| the Act of 74. It applies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| to everybody, all the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| of the Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| except for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| seven positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| which he names, which are his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| positions, the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| he's entered for. That's been struck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| Beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| That has been struck in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| And it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| just says appointees. It doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| quantify appointees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| I thought it was in here for his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| set of positions at his discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| It's three under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| 1974 Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| including the cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| The cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| Prison cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| But this is, if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| not there, my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| and I wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| the one that worked with Commissioner Jay on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| this, although it's out of my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| Mike Moyers is the one that did the drafting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| with him. I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| I'd just like for that to be quantified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| so that he doesn't just go out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| hire everybody as appointees without them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| being appointed to the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| And the Sheriff's position was at seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| which is basically what's there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| is okay with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| I'll make a note of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| It may have just been an oversight in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| translating the language. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5434)|
| 1:30:38| Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair. There's a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| of things in here that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| is kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| bothersome and I don't know if we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| do this legally or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| One of the things it says is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| board will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5452)|

| 1:30:56| Is that correct? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| Then we have one on page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| two of ten here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| Item number two, it says therefore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| service on the merit board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5466)|

| 1:31:12| member voluntarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| to an agreement to forgo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5474)|

| 1:31:24| Can we ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| a person that volunteers not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| to participate in elections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| That's already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| in the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| There's a limitation on the classified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| They cannot take part in political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| campaigns. But aren't we paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| some now? I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| No, I mean that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| a little different wording but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| thing that's in the 74| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5510)|

| 1:32:14| like this, what this is saying, they can't participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| in that, not just in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| merit system, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| That's the way it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| There are, Commissioner Buster, there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| other quasi-governmental entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| that exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| such as an example would be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| KUB board. If you are a member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| of the KUB board, which is an appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5554)|

| 1:32:38| is a quasi-governmental entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| that makes decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| about whether or not to participate in any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5563)|

| 1:32:49| remove the politics out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| That's just one example but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| the goal of this is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| be as apolitical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| to ensure the fairest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| and best governance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| for our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| You're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| about officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| but I'm talking about other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| outside the sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| Like I said, it's like trustees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5597)|

| 1:33:21| Maybe they want to support somebody like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| and we're telling them you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| I can understand it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| within the system itself like KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| but we're telling them about all government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| The KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5613)|

| 1:33:37| any political activity, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| It's not just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| utility company or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| The goal of that language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| is to say if you're going to volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| to serve on this, you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| conduct yourself in an apolitical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| environment for the time that you are on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| It doesn't mean you can't vote for somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| but we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| to remove as much politics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| out of this as possible and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| the goal of that paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| I thought it was within the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| I have trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| limiting people in their participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| in government. The second thing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| that we go into is some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| things that said they're required to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| I know we're paying people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| to do some of those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| We can't hear you over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| Do you have your mic on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| No, I guess I'm not talking directly into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| mic here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| Like on page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| three, there's some items in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5673)|
| 1:34:39| some things that are required to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| like in the keeping of the records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| and things like this and that's more like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| a paid staff that you would have because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| that's going to be time consuming and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| the number of seven in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| and that is for the paid staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| a little bit more than we do need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| Is that overkill for that position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| Seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| Seven and eight are essentially referring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| to the staff that runs the merit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| currently. I mean it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| the administrative staff. It's not the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5717)|
| 1:35:21| The number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| on the merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| council that is in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| over and above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| the three that we now have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| the city of Knoxville has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| has five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| Chattanooga, to my recollection, has nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| They all have more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| than three. Three is a very small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| number for the merit council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| Whatever number you all choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| Yeah, I just numbered seven. It seemed like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| a little bit overkill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| If I may go a little further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| on to answer your question, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| is not taken into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| the Little Hatch Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| which is in effect in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| which mirrors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| the Federal Hatch Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| which says if you're an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| you can't use that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| and go out and campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| in that position for somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| or take part in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| That Supreme Court decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| was set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| United States Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| said yes, you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| have limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| on taking part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| political campaigns and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| political activities. You can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| that in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| rules. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| 1973| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| CNC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| postal worker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| versus merit council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| and that's a U.S. Supreme Court case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| which upheld the Hatch Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| which we adopted it as the Little Hatch Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| That's a limitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| that's in there anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| And the reason why I was asking this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| and I want to make it definitely clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| when you walk out the door and you don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| any signing on you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| that you're part of the merit council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| or you're part of the sheriff's department or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| like this, does that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| not go into your private life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| once you go out and through for the day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| Clearly it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| but the Supreme Court has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| that the Hatch Act is a valid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| purpose saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| you as an employee or an officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| in the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| can't take part in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| and be involved with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| and that's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| Thank you Mr. Chair. I do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| a couple of questions. One specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| political involvement like we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| talking about. Is there a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| requirement that potential board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| members not be politically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| active for a certain amount of time prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| to applying for the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| or being appointed so it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| at the start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| once they are appointed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| During their term of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| So it's not prior to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| Or after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| It also has a provision in there if they decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| they want to run for office they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| resign their position and immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| run for office. If somebody decides they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| to get involved with a political campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| and their brother's running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| and they say I've got to go help my brother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| they can just resign that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| There's no requirement for them to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5922)|
| 1:38:45| in that volunteer capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| I know this is kind of getting into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| the weeds but what would the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| definition of being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| politically active include?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| Are we going so small as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| a yard sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| I'm sorry, could you say that again? It's hard to hear over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| What would be the definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| of being politically active?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| Would it be so small as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| something as placing a yard sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| in their yard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| The definition as written is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| defined as paid or unpaid volunteering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| advertising, donating, canvassing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| or soliciting votes for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| candidate or ballot initiative within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| confines of Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| So I would consider a yard sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| to be advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| And therefore it wouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| prohibited. And also I want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| I point out in there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| violations of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| don't come to commission even as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| governing body as a first step. The check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| and balance is the ethics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| committee, which is a totally independent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| independent appointed body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| So let's say Joe Smith is on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| merit council and he's walking around with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| Sheriff Bob's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| signs and breaking the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| then anyone can file an ethics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| complaint. They can look into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| and say, oh yeah, we have a picture with Bob with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| a sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| shirt on or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| Ethics complaint can essentially make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| recommendation to us and say, yeah, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| person is violating that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| and we don't think they ought to hold that seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| and then we can take action. But it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| it's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| there is a mechanism to sort of investigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| that in a proper way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| But that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| complaint would have to be filed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| someone. Somebody, yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| all complaints to the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| have to come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| some citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| So someone else would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| to initiate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| Somebody would have to. I mean it could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| another member of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| They're a private citizen as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| On page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| three of ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| this was something I do believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| Schoomaker brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| or someone brought up, I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| on eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| section F number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| eight where it says keep any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| other such records as may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| necessary for the efficient and proper administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| of the Knox County Sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| and the Knox County System| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| Merit System Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6071)|
| 1:41:13| So does that mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| I know this pertains to the paid staff, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| Yeah, this is the administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| duties of the paid staff of the merit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| and it essentially says they're the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| keeping body and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| they have to keep the records, let's say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| of the personnel that they're helping hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| and you know, it's the paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| of doing the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| Well, just adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| the Knox County Sheriff and the merit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| just seemed, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| what specifically for the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| for the administration of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| the office. It'd be sort of any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| records related to how people are hired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6105)|
| 1:41:47| or fired. Hiring and firing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| And that's it. Correct, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| And I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| you know, there's no sense to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| in defining that further because that's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| administrative function that has to be managed by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| administrative team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| Well, I mean, if we leave it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| broad, it can be pushed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| many different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| And then on page 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| of 10, section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| 42-58| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| part A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| where it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| kind of towards the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6141)|
| 1:42:25| prior to, well actually it's the last sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| Prior to placement on the list of eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| background investigations must be completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| by the sheriff and the candidate found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| in conformity with standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| Okay, so it sounds like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| I know right now what they do is basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| a records request just to make sure any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| applicant doesn't have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| criminal background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| any criminal records, but it's not really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| specific. It's not the full-blown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| background check that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| would do. And then they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| placed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6173)|
| 1:42:55| the list of eligibles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| once that record request is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6177)|
| 1:42:59| However, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| 42-59| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| part B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| it says that merit creates the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| eligibility list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| in this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| is it coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6193)|
| 1:43:15| from the sheriff or is it coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| from merit? It seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| contradictory to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| Yeah, that's language. I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| I'm pretty sure that's language that's in there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| but let me just look at it real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| So it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| 42-58A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| on page 6 of 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| and then 42-59| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| B on page 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| of 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6217)|
| 1:43:49| I think 42-58A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| is just simply saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6233)|
| 1:43:55| placement, it doesn't say by who, it just says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| prior to actually ending up on the eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| list, they have to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| a background check by the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6243)|
| 1:44:05| if it says in 42-59 that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| the merit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| puts them on the list, that still applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| All that 42-58A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| says is prior to getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| on there, they have to pass a background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| from the sheriff. Okay. Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| the way it is, it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| my understanding and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| Ms. Taylor, if you will correct me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| if I'm wrong, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| they're placed on the eligibility list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| they go through the application process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| and once the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| shorter version of the records request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| is completed, they go through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| application, then that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| is when the background check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| the full-blown background check is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| The reason why I'm bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| this up is that this does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| leave it to where if it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| is someone who may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| not be desirable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6291)|
| 1:44:53| by any sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| in the future, they could say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| oh, well, they didn't pass the background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| first. It could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| used as a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| of limiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6303)|
| 1:45:05| someone from applying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| I think the intention, I think we're probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| on the same page and if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| some, if you have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| suggestion of how that language might change, I'd be happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| to entertain it as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| an amendment. You don't have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| do that tonight, but if you wanted to send that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| and copy. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| the goal here in that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| always just clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| somebody has to pass a background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| check. I completely understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| and agree with you. I think if we just took out the words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| by the sheriff, then that would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| Because that's what was added already. That was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| just the new language that was added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| and I feel like if we take that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| then the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6341)|
| 1:45:43| process can resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| Well, I think the question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| leaving it vague of just saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| they must pass a background investigation. By who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| Well, the first one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| is just, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| a simple records request. Okay. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| if we could probably work on that, I think we're probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| pretty close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| My last one is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6363)|
| 1:46:07| on 10 of 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| 42-67. Correct me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| if I'm wrong. Wasn't this language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| in the same ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| 0-21-7-107| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| that failed in July of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| 21? The language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| has been amended a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| Right. It just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| took out the specifics from where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| the rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| such and such or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| section such and such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| and then it took off the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6393)|
| 1:46:37| It took off reclassified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6397)|
| 1:46:39| of a classified employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| et cetera, et cetera, from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| out of section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| 5.1.1 of the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| Some of the language is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| Some has been amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| Can we bring back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| something that has failed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| You can bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| back a whole new, this is a whole new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| ordinance with lots of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| different parts and pieces and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| it is substantially different than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| But yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6431)|
| 1:47:17| So I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| really confused with all this so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| forgive me for my confusion because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| we have been told since November that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6443)|
| 1:47:25| in order for our merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| council to be valid that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| needed to adopt the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| 1974 state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6451)|
| 1:47:35| Like I just mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| as Commissioner J said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| some language is included from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| the ordinances that failed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| that passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| It's a combination of both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| Yes, but suddenly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| does this make merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6469)|

| 1:48:01| law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| Here's wherein the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| issue arose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| It was raised by one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| attorneys involved in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| appeals which now everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| seems to have dropped for some reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6493)|
| 1:48:17| that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| present act was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| invalid. Our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| said okay, we're not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| We think that yeah, it should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| have been adopted, the act of 74| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| because of a technicality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| It's a question that's up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| The only way to resolve it was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| file it as a declaratory judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| and say judge, you tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| That's why that lawsuit was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| Then the reason that the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| Commissioner Bussler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| and Commissioner Beeler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| that supported was that it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| take away the problem of a gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| because if we went forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6535)|
| 1:48:57| with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| grievances that were going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| on, and then the judge said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| you don't even have a valid system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| then all of a sudden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| every one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| protected officers would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| uncovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| That was what we thought. We've got to get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| done. That's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| Commissioner Bussler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| and Beeler said let's go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| and get that done, take that awful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| way from the judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| take that issue away from the judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| and assure that we'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| protection for these officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| That's the background on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| Now, can you go ahead and do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| this, what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| before you right now? Yes, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| There's no lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| pending anymore for that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| It doesn't mean the question can't be raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| in the future by somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| if they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| But if this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| board takes the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| action to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| however this board decides to do it as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| policy matter, I will assure you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| that this office will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| defend you to the utmost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| But it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| still leave us open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| for a lawsuit. If somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| wanted to do that, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6609)|
| 1:50:11| it leaves it open to a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| It's just like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| masking thing that we settled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| with the schools. That lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6617)|
| 1:50:19| could come back if there's a rise in COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| or something and file another lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| with different kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6623)|
| 1:50:25| You're still open. You're still subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| to it. We'll do what we always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6627)|
| 1:50:29| do and defend to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6629)|
| 1:50:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| Just to give a brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| rundown, I'm going to go to Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| Schoonmaker, then I'm going to acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| Ms. Candler, the Director of Human| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| Resources, then I'll come back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| Commissioner Smith. Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| Chairman Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| Yeah, my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| first question was, do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| need to adopt the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| Sheriff's Civil Service Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| of 1974? But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| that could actually be adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| at some other point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| if we needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| to. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| As far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| as the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| proposal, I like how we've now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| taken basically a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| 40, 50-year-old document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| and now updated it because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| we need to do that on a regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| basis. Any kind of rules or bylaws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| we do need to update those on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| I do think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| idea of seven members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| and no alternate is a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| people getting sick, vacations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| whatever, you still want to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| turnout for your meetings. The other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| thing is, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| like the idea of now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| having an official name for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| the board. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| a key point so everybody understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6715)|
| 1:51:57| what's going on. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| of us received, I guess, yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| a page-and-a-half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| letter from a constituent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| outlining some of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| on, from a legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| basis, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| I don't know if Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| Jay, you want to respond or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| law director, because both of you all got copies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| but is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6739)|
| 1:52:21| anything in here that we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| really be concerned about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| I would defer any legal questions to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| our legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| The answer to that question is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6749)|
| 1:52:33| There are false...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| I shouldn't say false, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6755)|

| 1:52:39| First of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| the writer says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| the second fatal flaw is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6763)|

| 1:52:55| we're not under that and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6775)|

| 1:52:59| one was, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| we've already talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| fails to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| the Hatch Act, the Little Hatch Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| the Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| of 1974 itself, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6789)|
| 1:53:11| the present ordinance with regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| to political activity, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| says you can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| If you're a classified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6797)|
| 1:53:19| employee, you can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| Can I get a clarifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| question on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6803)|
| 1:53:25| I think this is where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| Commissioner Buster's question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| got confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| The classified employees, I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| the Hatch and the Little Hatch Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6813)|
| 1:53:35| but these are not employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| these board members, so does it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| still apply to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| I don't think that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| amendment does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| and the reason for that is it was raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| vigorously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| in these hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| because one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| of the three was actively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| in the prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| sheriff's election wearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| coming into a hearing wearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| a Vote for Trammell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| Vote for Trammell hat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| and then unabashedly said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| he was supporting J.J. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| That's a member of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| committee, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| why that is being put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| But is there a distinguishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| in the Hatch Act and the Little Hatch Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| between an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| and a volunteer board member?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6863)|
| 1:54:27| If you want to get into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| Little Hatch Act, it's anybody acting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| on behalf of the government, so yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| That specific thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| is not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| If that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6877)|
| 1:54:39| Do I think it should be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| I was very concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| looking from afar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| the fact that you've got to look at these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| This merit council sits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| as a quasi-judicial body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6889)|
| 1:54:51| It's a judge. You want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| your judges to be absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| non-political, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| why I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| working with Mike Moyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| has that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6903)|
| 1:55:07| And then just a follow-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| question. On some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| concerns that were raised by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| citizen, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6913)|
| 1:55:15| we are a charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| form of government, does that make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| some difference in some of the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6919)|
| 1:55:21| were mentioned in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| I don't know that being a charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| form, the main thing that he raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| was that he was saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| that he cited this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| totally disregarded the fact that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| is a little hatch act and that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| present thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6937)|
| 1:55:39| the present ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| as well as the Act of 74, says you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| can't take part politically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| case I do have to cite again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| it's CSC v. Letter Carriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| The 1973| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| case clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6953)|
| 1:55:55| said that a governmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| employer can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| rules regarding taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| part in political campaigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| The hatch act, it upheld the hatch act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| and said clearly you can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| The case cited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| writer in here even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6971)|
| 1:56:13| mentions the validity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| of that case because the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| in the case he cited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6977)|
| 1:56:19| didn't have anything to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6979)|
| 1:56:21| with whether or not the hatch act or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| those things were, it had to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6983)|
| 1:56:25| whether this person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| could be fired because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6987)|
| 1:56:29| he carried a sign to his mother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6989)|

| 1:56:33| That's what that whole case was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6993)|
| 1:56:35| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=6995)|

| 1:56:45| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| Chairman. Stephanie Candler, Senior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| Director of Human Resources and Benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| for Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| Thank you for letting me speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| I actually received this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7015)|
| 1:56:57| this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7017)|
| 1:56:59| and my department is directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| affected by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| section E on page 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| essentially put the employees of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| merit system under my purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| would request of the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| as much as I know everyone hates to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| drag this out a little bit longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| a deferral for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| so we can at least look into some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| implications of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7043)|

| 1:57:27| I was the Benefits Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| and we merged the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| in October so we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| a new structure that has come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| about just in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| We're happy to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| Knox County wherever we can but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| I don't know all of the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| of the merit system and to take on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| four new employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| without at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| a little bit of time to consider what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| would look like for my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| I would just ask that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| receive about a 30-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7077)|
| 1:57:59| Mr. Chairman, if I could jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| Any changes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| this ordinance would take two readings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| so it's going to be a 60-day process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7089)|
| 1:58:11| point out that the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| employees of the merit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| have had no oversight for as long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| as I can understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| from a director position like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| yours and so I don't think there's anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| broken right now that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| they couldn't operate as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7105)|
| 1:58:27| they currently are operating but this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| wouldn't be a 60-day process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| and wouldn't take effect even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| if passed for another 30 days thereafter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7113)|
| 1:58:35| so it wouldn't be until September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| even if it stayed on the current timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7119)|
| 1:58:41| There are some considerations here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7121)|
| 1:58:43| in terms of oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| and I would just like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| invite any of you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| discuss those with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| anytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| I'm at the other end of Randy's Hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| obviously want to do the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| thing for the county but I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| have an obligation to serve both offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| so I serve, my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| benefits department serves all of the elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| officials, sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| we work closely with HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| we're in essence a custody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| of records for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| all of our employees because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7155)|
| 1:59:17| we use the MUNIS system and my office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7157)|
| 1:59:19| manages that as well so there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| are just some considerations and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| digging into an entirely new process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| and an entirely new system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7165)|
| 1:59:27| not opposed, I just feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| I need to also discuss this with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| the mayor and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| my bosses to make sure everyone understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| we're not a typical HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| office because of the way the county is set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| but we do serve and we want to be impartial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| apolitical, have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| political interest here but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| I can't always speak for whoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| may be in my seat down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| so I also want to consider the long term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| implications of that and I appreciate your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7193)|

| 2:01:37| fix that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| because if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7299)|

| 2:01:53| authority to be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7313)|

| 2:01:59| Again I don't know how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7319)|
| 2:02:01| fix that but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7321)|
